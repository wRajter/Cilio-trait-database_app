Preface and Acknowledgements
Tropical soil ciliates are poorly known (Foissner 1987b). Thus, I made busy holidays in Venezuela
in January and February 1996 and came back to Austria with 68 well-sorted soil samples on
which I worked, with some interruptions, the next five years publishing important biogeographic
flagship species in individual papers (see Introduction) while the comprehensive publication had
to wait. I am deeply grateful to Prof. Dr. Maurizio G. Paoletti (Padova University, Italy) who
initiated the expedition, to Dr. Hugo Cerda (Caracas University, Venezuela), our wise guide in
Venezuela, and to Dr. Ilse Foissner for organization and help with sampling.
Our first monograph on soil ciliate diversity in Namibia, southwest Africa (Foissner et al. 2002)
has been widely acknowledged by taxonomists and ecologists. Now, we finished a monograph
on soil ciliate diversity in the neotropis, i.e., Venezuela (including some samples from the unique
Galápagos islands). Both monographs are unique in several ways. For the first time since the
unforgotten monographs by Mueller (1786), ehrenberg (1838), stein (1859,1867), Penard
(1922), and Kahl (1930-35), each describes more than 100 new species and each species list
comprises about 400 painstakingly identified species which is by far the largest number ever
published in single studies from comparatively small areas. Thus, these lists will be invaluable
documents for biodiversity researchers. All species are described by a combination of classic
(live observation) and modern (silver impregnation, scanning electron microscopy) methods, and
many are illustrated by a multitude of micrographs. Thus, we hope that our monographs will
serve as examples for ciliate community studies.
It is an increasing problem to find interested and talented students and post-docs for studies
like this. Several tried but gave up after having made a few species. I added their names to
the species we worked together. Thus, I had to do most work with technicians, especially with
Robert sChörghoFer and Andreas ZanKl who excellently smoothed the micrographs with
Photoshop; Michael gruber, M. sC., for making the morphometries and line drawings for half
of the hypotrichs; Birgit PeuKert, Johannes rattey, M. Sc., and Brigitte Moser for doing SEM
preparations and photographs; Dr. Wolf-Dietrich Krautgartner for ensuring the smooth operation
of the electron microscopes; Mag. Barbara harl and Dr. Heidi bartel for typing the text into the
computer; and Dr. Erna aesCht and Michaela MiniCh for layout and printing organization. I also
thank Hans-Werner breiner and Prof. Thorsten stoeCK (Kaiserslautern University, Germany)
for making molecular sequences for some taxa mentioned previously but formally described in
the present monograph. Special thanks to Dr. Remigius geiser and Prof. Helmut berger for help
with nomenclature; I followed most advices.
Finally, I greatly appreciate the following persons for collecting soil samples containing species
described in the present monograph (countries in parentheses): Prof. Dr. Karl O. stetter
(Galápagos), Prof. Dr. Eberhard stüber (Rwanda), Dr. Hubert blatterer (Virgin island), Prof.
Dr. David Patterson (Panama), and Prof. Dr. D. G. Mueller (Chile).
Financial support was provided by the Austrian Science Fund (Project 22846-B17). Without
this grant, the work would have been impossible. I am also very grateful to Hofrat Mag. Fritz
gusenleitner, director of the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz, Austria,
who made it possible to publish the work in full length and excellent quality. Altogether, but
without traveling and my ordinary salary, 400,000 Euro were needed for this monograph and the
individual papers mentioned in the Introduction.

Terrestrial and Semiterrestrial Ciliates (Protozoa,
Ciliophora) from Venezuela and Galápagos
Wilhelm Foissner
A b s t r a c t : A highly diverse ciliate community was found in 71 samples from terrestrial and
semiterrestrial habitats from the western half of Venezuela (67 samples) and from Galápagos (4).
The ciliates, respectively, their resting cysts, were re-activated from the air-dried samples using
the non-flooded Petri dish method. Species were identified by combining live observation, silver
impregnation, and scanning electron microscopy.
The faunistic and taxonomic results are summarized in chapter 3.1.1, i.e., in a detailed list of
species, showing their distribution and frequency: (i) A total of 459 ciliate species is recorded
in this monograph, 421 from Venezuela and Galápagos and 38 from other sites globally. Most
species are new records for the areas investigated. (ii) 120 species (28%) are new to science,
82 from Venezuela including 13 from Galápagos (20%) and 38 from various sites globally; 50
species are redescribed. (iii) Based on these findings, 44 new genera and subgenera, four new
families (Lingulotrichidae, Deviatidae, Urosomoididae, Apometopidae), and a new suborder
(Woodruffina) are established. (iv) The ontogenesis is described for 10 species: Platyophryides
macrostoma, Cinetochilides terricola, Protospathidium salinarum, Notodeviata halophila,
Idiodeviata venezuelensis, Deviata brasiliensis, Paragonostomum australiense, Gonostomum
singhii, Oxytricha pulvillus, and Lepidothrix dorsiincisura. (v) 656 type and voucher slides have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). (vi) Eight
species, formerly known only by their molecular sequences, have been identified and described
(Fig. 124, 294): Maryna umbrellata, Maryna meridiana, Bursaria ovata, Platyophryides
macrostoma, Sagittarides oblongistoma, Sagittaria venezuelensis, Apowoodruffia salinaria, and
Condylostomides coeruleus.
252 of the 459 ciliate species occur at only one or two sites, showing a patchy distribution of
most species and a high proportion of rare species. No species occurred in all samples, and the
euryoecious Colpoda inflata was most frequent occurring in 73% of samples. Only 14 species
have frequences ≥ 40%, and most of them are frequent in soils globally. There is an average of 34
species/sample when the rotten rainforest samples are excluded.
Taken into account total species number and the proportion of new species, seven local ciliate
diversity centres can be selected: (i) The richest sample (126 species, nine undescribed) is number
(56), i.e., mud and soil from some flat, ephemeral puddles in the Morrocoy National Park on the
north coast of Venezuela. (ii, iii) Samples (52) and (61) are from the rainforest in the Henri Pittier
National Park with 101 and 91 species, respectively. (iv) The next richest site is number (23), i.e.,
a Mahadja (highly fertilized savanna soil) with 83 species, including three undescribed ones. (v)
Site (54) follows, i.e., mud and soil from a highly saline coastal puddle with 78 species of which
10 were undescribed. (vi) A total of 117 species, 16 undescribed, occurred in 10 Lajas (lithotelmas
on granitic outcroppings in the savanna). (vii) In the four Galápagos samples occurred 68 species
of which at least 13 were undescribed. Several of the new taxa are flagship species with very
likely restricted distribution.

1. Introduction
I would like to refer the reader to the introduction of the monograph on Namibian soil ciliates
(Foissner et al. 2002) because I still hold the views presented at that time, viz., a decreasing
interest in morphological alpha-taxonomy of protists in general and of soil ciliates in particular;
the frequent misuse of grant money by ecologists doing “biodiversity studies” without identifying
the species; and that there are thousands of undescribed ciliate species, one third of which very
likely has a restricted distribution.
However, one important aspect should be recalled, viz., cyst genera and species. Although we
emphasized this matter already in FOISSNER et al. (2002) and FOISSNER (2011), most new species
and genera are still described without their resting cyst though it is the most important stage
in the life cycle because the cyst protects species to become extinct locally and, possibly, even
globally. For us, the time is ripe to base new genera and species on their resting cysts which are
very likely better phylogenetic markers than, e.g., the presence or absence of transverse and
caudal cirri in hypotrichs (BERGER 1999, 2006, 2008, 2011).
The Neotropis project started in 1996 when I collected 67 soil samples from a variety of habitats in
Venezuela. The investigation needed six years but a monograph could not be finished because of
other projects granted for post-docs and technicians. Thus, 20 years passed before I could finalize
the project in July 2015. During this time, we published several monographs and many papers
containing 21 species discovered in Venezuela. They are shown in the following compilation;
(Xa = new species described before this monograph with type locality in Venezuela; Xh = new
species described before this monograph with type locality not in Venezuela but occurring there,
e.g., Cephalospathula brasiliensis).

Finally I want to explain why I do not publish the monograph with one of the large, famous
publishers. It is quite simple: they take a lot of money but lay-out and printing is usually so poor
that the great effort to get nice micrographs becomes null and void.

2. Materials and Methods, Species Concept, Types
2.1 Materials
2.1.1 General Site Description
2.1.1.1 Brief Overview of Venezuela
There is no need to describe Venezuela in detail because several excellent travel guides are
available (MaddiCKs 2011, Kaiser & gordones 1994) and the centres of our sampling activity are
treated in some detail in the following paragraphs and the site descriptions.
Venezuela (Repùblica Bolivariana de Venezuela) is on the north of South America, bordering
the Caribbean Sea, between Colombia in the west and Guyana in the east and Brazil in the south
(Fig.1). It extends for about 1300 km from north to south and 1500 km from west to east, i.e.,
between latitude 1° and 12° of the Equator and longitude 60° to 73°. Thus, the whole area is in
the tropics and forms a distinct biogeographic region called Neotropis or Neogaea. Terrain and
climate go from hot and sticky at sea level to icy cold on Andean peaks, although most of the
land lies at under 1,000 m. Average daytime temperature: 25°C. Dry season: December – April,
rainy season: May – November. About half of Venezuela is forest land and one third is Savanna
dominated by Tachypogon, a perennial grass (Fig.2).

8

Fig. 2. Simplified vegetation map, showing that most of Venezuela is covered with forests and savannas (from WIKIPEDIA
1972).
Our samples represent roughly half of Venezuela´s land area, i.e., we collected only in the western
half of the country the large Orinoco River forming the border (Fig. 1). We concentrated on the
following regions and habitats: the north coast west of the capital Caracas, including the Henri
Pittier National Park; the region around Pto. Ayacucho in the south; and the Andean rainforest
around the town of Merida. Special habitats are Lajas and Mahadjas. See netuZhilin et al. (1999)
for a detailed description of the Puerto Ayacucho area, savannas, and rainforests.
2.1.1.2 The North Coast between the Village of Chichiriviche and the Capital Caracas (Fig. 1, 3, 4)
We sampled two areas, viz., the coast sensu stricto and the Henri Pittier rainforest. Most of the
coast is flat in this area and thus flooded by the sea during storms and high tides. Thus, these
samples are more or less saline. The “wild” areas are grown with grass and bushes. We sampled
soil and soil and mud from some of the many ephemeral pools around the village of Chichirivice,
i.e., in and near the Morrocoy National Park (Fig. 1, 8, 9).
Slightly east of Chichiriviche is the Henri Pittier National Park, a small but very nice coastal
cloudforest with an up to 2,426 m high mountain. On the north side, samples were taken around
the coastal village of Choroni; on the south side, the samples were taken around the Biological
9

Station Rancho Grande at 1,100 – 1,300 m above sea level. For details on site, soil, and the
invertebrate fauna, see Paoletti (1980) and Paoletti et al. (1991).
2.1.1.3 South of Venezuela, i.e., in the Outskirts of the Town of Puerto Ayacucho (Fig. 1, 2):
Savannas, Mahadjas and Lajas
Puerto Ayacucho is very near to the Orinoco River and to the Equator. Thus, there is an annual
precipitation of 3,000 mm and an annual mean temperature of 30°C. The soils are very sandy
because the ancient, crystalline Guyana shield is superimposed by sandstone. Most samples were
collected from the savanna at the right side of the Orinoco River and from the rainforest south
of Pto. Ayacucho. We sampled four main habitats: savannas, Lajas, Mahadjas, and the rainforest.
The savanna at Pto. Ayacucho extends as a narrow, usually less than 30 km wide ribbon south
of the Orinoco River. It is dominated by Tachypogon, a perennial grass, and the “Chaparro”
(Curatella americana), a small tree that withstands the bush-fire. The lowland areas are slightly
inundated when the Orinoco has high water; thus, algal crusts are frequently found on the soil
surface. The savanna is used as pasture (mainly for cattle) and burnt at irregular intervals; samples
were taken only from sites without signs of recent burning. The soil is very sandy, rather compact,
contains few litter and humus, and was dry when collected; to get “good” samples larger humus
particles and decaying litter were sieved off the sand and added to the sample in a way that sieved
matter and sandy soil each provided about 50% of the sample. The soil surface becomes very hot
on sunny days; on 6.2.1996, we measured 52°C at 2 o’clock.
Within the savannas there are two special habitats: Mahadjas and Lajas. Mahadjas are human-
made, highly fertile fields usually near to small farms. They are usually <10,000 m2 in size and
used to grow vegetables, manioc, and fruits. The fertilizer comes from cattle and/or horses which
are fenced in the area over-night so that the excrements are collected. It needs several months
to become a “good” Mahadja but it can be used for 5-10 years, depending on the amount of
excrements and the plants grown. Samples were taken as described in the next paragraph.
The savanna sites serving as control to the Mahadja sites were sampled as follows: 20 – 30 cores
(5 cm ø, 5 cm high) of soil were taken from a transect 50 – 100 m long. Then the cores were
smashed and sieved through a steel-net with 2 mm-sized meshes. The organic materials (decaying
leaves, grass roots) and soil (mainly sand) particles which remained in the sieve were used to
investigate ciliate diversity. This procedure enriches the organic matter and is necessary because
the non-flooded Petri dish method works best when sufficient organic material is available (see
above and methods).
Lajas is the indigenous name for flat, ephemeral (astatic) puddles on granitic outcroppings usually
lower than 30 m (except of the famous Tepuis in eastern Venezuela which reach hundreds of
meters). The Lajas are black due to a cover of filamentous and coccal cyanobacteria (Fig. 3–5, 7).
Lajas have very different sizes, ranging from a few cm to 10 m or more. The larger and deeper
ones are often partially or completely grown with an endemic cushion plant, Velloziaceae, that
belongs to the Liliidae and accumulates dust from the air and transforms it to soil. Usually, the
bottom of the Lajas is covered by some soil mixed with gravel, crust pieces of cyanobacteria,
and some leaf litter from the bushes growing nearby. All Lajas were dry when sampled. Thus, we
collected the litter and mud and, if present, the soil from velloziacean cushions.

2.1.1.4 Rainforests South of the Town of Puerto Ayacucho, in the Outskirts of the Town of Merida,
and in the Henri Pittier National Park (Fig. 1, 8)
When rainforest litter and soil samples are air-dried for the non-flooded Petri dish method, then
one must consider that the resting cysts of rainforest protists are much weaker than those from
moderate or hot and dry regions. There is a rapid loss of species in samples older than 9 month
(Foissner 1997, 2011), and new data from Venezuela show great loss within a month (see samples
35, 36, 41-46). For details on the rainforest south of Puerto Ayacucho, see netuZhilin et al. (1999).
In Merida and Borneo (Foissner 2011), I had the opportunity to look at fresh samples. They were
full of ciliates, similar as in a mesotrophic river! The negative influence of prolonged drying
becomes obvious also in the samples from the Henri Pittier National Park in Venezuela (samples
47-52, 58-62, 64). Those which were investigated within a year (samples 52, 59-62) provided
much more species (e.g. 101 species in sample 52) than those investigated 4-6 years after collection
(e.g. 27 species in sample 64).
These observations provide two recommendations: soil and litter ciliates from everwet rainforests
should be investigated on site without any culture method or within about two month after air-
drying when the non-flooded Petri dish method is used. Up to one year drying is possible for
rainforests whose litter and upper soil layer become dry during the dry season.
2.1.2 Description of Individual Samples
General description of main sample region, see chapter 2.1.1. Geographic coordinates are mainly
from Meyer´s Atlas and from GOOGLE because GPS or detailed maps were not available. Salinity
and pH were measured with a refractometer and pH paper, respectively, in samples watered for
1 hour.

Site 71 (a single sample): Santa Cruz island, surroundings of Puerto Ayora, hotel San Fernando,
90°18’W 0°44’S. Material collected: leaf litter and soil under a Pandanus palm in the hotel
garden; not saline.
2.2 Methods
Methods are the same as described in the monograph on Namibian soil ciliates to which the
reader is thus referred to (Foissner et al. 2002). However, a few new or very important issues are
described or copied from the Namibian monograph: sampling and sample processing; collection
of material for preparations; and estimation of in vivo size. A recent description of the preparation
methods has been published by Foissner (2014).
21

2.2.1 Sampling and Sample Processing
The material collected usually include mineral top soil (0-5 cm, rarely up to 10 cm depth) with
fine plant roots, the humic layer, and the deciduous and/or grass litter from the soil surface. In
soil with few organic materials and very sandy habitats, litter was sieved off the sand with an
ordinary kitchen sieve (1 mm mesh-size), so that the final sample consisted of about 80% litter
and 20% sand and gravel. Usually, 10 small subsamples were collected with a small shovel from
an area of about 100 m2 and mixed to a composite sample. Bark samples were usually taken from
one to three trees. The bark was collected with a knife, selecting for regions grown with mosses
or lichens and/or containing some soil. See chapter 2.1.1.3 for special methods of collecting
Mahadjas and the bordering savannas. For rainforest samples, see chapter 2.1.1.4.
Generally, a “good” sample consists of 50% litter, humus and roots and 50% mineral soil. The
litter and humus are very important because they release many nutrients when the sample is
rewetted, stimulating growth of bacteria, fungi, flagellates, and amoeba, that is, the main food
of ciliates. The nutrient increase obviously decouples microbiostasis, as explained in Foissner
(1987b).
All samples were air-dried for at least one month and then sealed in plastic bags. Such samples
can be stored for years without any significant loss of species, provided they are from arid or
temperate environments (Foissner 1997). This is emphasized by the Namibian investigations:
there is no correlation between storage time and species number; indeed, the richest samples (nos.
4, 49) are those stored for over four years (Foissner et al. 2002).
All collections were analysed with the “non-flooded Petri dish method”, as described by Foissner
(1987b, 1992). The technique is not perfect, but likely the best available for biodiversity assessment
of soil ciliates at large. The protocol is simple:
1. Put the material in a Petri dish and spread over the bottom of the dish in at least a 1 cm,
better 2 to 3 cm thick layer. As concerns the Venezuelan samples, sufficient material was
available to fill a 2 cm high Petri dish 13 cm across or, rarely, a 3 cm high dish 18 cm in
diameter. Basically, a large Petri dish (18 cm) is preferable because it provides more material
for preparations.
2. Slightly over-saturate but do not flood the sample with distilled water. Water should be added
to the sample until 5-20 ml will drain off when the Petri dish is tilted (45°) and the soil gently
pressed with a finger. Complete saturation takes up to 12 hours, so check cultures after this
time. Never flood the sample, that is make an Aufguss (“infusion”) because then only a few
common species will develop. Further, the material should have been dry for at least one
month.
3. Cover Petri dish and pinch a clip between bottom and lid to enable gas exchange. Generally,
care must be taken that the samples do not putrefy. This happens rather easily with saline
material, soil containing animal excrements or, in “ordinary” samples, if the litter is very
easily decomposable. In this case, change the water in the sample and do not cover it for
some days so that plenty of air is available; further, slightly under-saturate sample with water.
Heavily saline soil (≥ 20‰) should be “washed”, if no ciliates develop. Saturate the sample
22

with water, as described above. After two to three days, remove the percolate and saturate
again with water. Repeat two to four times, until ciliates begin to develop.
4. A distinct succession occurs in the rewetted samples. Thus, they must be inspected on days
2, 6/7, 13/14, 21/22, and 30. Later inspections usually add only few species, likely because
microbiostasis (ciliatostasis; see Foissner 1987b) increases and metazoan (rotifers, nematods)
and protozoan (mainly heliozoans!) predators often became abundant. For inspection, the
Petri dish is tilted some seconds and a rather large drop (~ 0.3 ml) of the drained water (“soil
percolate”) taken with a Pasteur pipette and inspected for species; several such drops must
be investigated from different sites of the Petri dish, until the last drop adds but few species.
2.2.2 Collection of Material for Preparations
If a “difficult” species is noted, which happens in more than 70% of the samples, material for
preparations must be collected. To obtain many specimens, the Petri dish is tilted (45°) several
times for a minute or so and the percolating soil water collected with a Pasteur pipette from several
sites of the dish. If only little water (< 10 ml) drains from the sample and/or the species of interest
is very rare, it should be sprinkled with 10-15 ml distilled water. This will cause an osmotic shock,
detaching or rinsing many specimens from the soil particles and capillaries within about 10 min.
Then, the procedure described above is repeated, that is, the Petri dish is tilted several times and
the percolating soil water added to the first collection. Finally, the soil sample is again saturated
with clean table water (e.g. Eau de Volvic) and stored for the next investigation. Certainly, these
procedures strongly change the milieu, and thus a rather different ciliate community may develop,
possibly containing further “difficult” species. If so, the whole procedure is repeated, and so on.
Much care must be taken to keep the percolate clean of large (> 2 µm) soil particles, which would
disturb the investigation of the preparation, while particles smaller than 2 µm hardly disturb, if
not too numerous. To achieve clean material, note the following advices:
1. Usually, the percolating soil water which contains the organisms will be clean because the soil
particles soon become stabilized by microbial activities, mainly by fungal hyphae and bacterial
mucilage. Thus, extreme care must be taken not to destroy the soil structure developed in the
non-flooded Petri dish culture. Accordingly, the Petri dish must be handled gently and, if
necessary, distilled water sprinkled softly on the surface. To increase percolation, mild finger
pressure on the soil may be applied. Depending on the material sampled, the percolate has a
light brown to orange colour (from lignins, humus colloids, etc.), which does not disturb the
preparations (but see below).
2. The percolate is now gently shaken and large soil particles allowed to settle for about one
minute. Then, the supernatant, which is now ready for preparations, is collected with a
Pasteur pipette. Be careful not to lose bottom-dwellers. Occasionally, it may be helpful to
sieve the percolate through a plankton net with 50-100 µm mesh-size or to concentrate it by
mild centrifugation (max. 2000 r/min for a few seconds), especially for preparations with
expensive chemicals (osmium tetroxide in Chatton-lwoFF silver nitrate impregnation).
23

Other culture methods: The non-flooded Petri dish cultures, as described above, provided about
90% of the material contained in the monograph. The rest is from a variety of ordinary “limnetic”
cultures. First, clone cultures were made in the usual way by transferring individual specimens
into various media, preferable Eau de Volvic (French table water), either pure or mixed with
soil extract in a ratio of 10:1 and enriched with a crushed and two uncrushed wheat grains to
stimulate growth of indigenous food organisms, viz., bacteria and small flagellates; occasionally,
selected food items were added, for instance, filamentous cyanobacteria for several nassulids.
Second, 2 ml of the percolate (together with all organisms) were mixed with 8 ml Eau de Volvic
and enriched with wheat grains, as described above. Of course, such cultures contain a variety
of ciliates, and sometimes interesting species develop for a while. Third, a Petri dish was filled
with 10-20 µm culture medium plus some wheat grains. Then some grams of soil are added as an
inoculate to a small site of the Petri dish, taking care not to distribute it throughout the medium.
Such cultures were sometimes helpful for strongly saline material (> 20‰), which is set up with
artificial sea water. Fourth, if the sample is very saline (> 20‰), it may occur that no ciliates
develop. Such samples can be “washed” every third day with fresh table water, which decreases
the salt concentration. Frequently, ciliates appear after the third or fourth wash!
2.2.3 Estimation of In Vivo Size
Usually, we measure body length and width of a few contrasting specimens in vivo and without
using a coverslip. As the organisms are moving, this provides only approximate values which
are improved by the morphometric analysis of the preparations. The following percentages
compensate preparation shrinkage; they were obtained from comparative analyses, such as
shown in → Maryna spp.: 15% (10%-20%) for Foissner´s protargol method, 20-30% when pure
ethanol was used as a fixative; 5% for Chatton-Lwoff` silver nitrate preparations; and 0% for wet
preparations fixed with osmium vapours or a minute drop of osmium acid (2%). Shrinkage is
highly variable in SEM preparations, ranging from near zero to 100% in very fragile structures,
e.g., the lepidosomes of → trachelophyllids. The same applies for protargol methods and silver
carbonate preparations that do not fix specimens on a slide before bleaching and impregnation.

3.1.2 Species Numbers and Local Centres of Ciliate Diversity
3.1.2.1 Large scale comparison
Foissner (1998) listed 643 soil ciliate species. To this must be added 143 new species from
Namibia (Foissner et al. 2002) and 120 new species from the present study, resulting in about
900 species. This roughly doubles the number of species recorded in the present study (459),
indicating a rather high percentage of species distributed over more than one main biogeographic
region.

We can only speculate how many soil ciliate species might be present in Venezuelan soils because
we investigated only the western half of the country and most rainforest samples perished before
they could be investigated. The eastern half of the country, which contains so interesting habitats
as the Tepuis (high outcroppings with many endemic plants and animals) and the Orinoco estuary,
were not investigated. When considered only the western half of the country, we would expect to
double the number recorded, i. e., about 1000 species.
As already mentioned by Foissner et al. (2002), the high number of species found in the Namibian
study makes a comparison with literature data difficult. This is corroborated by the Venezuelan
results. Both studies support the conclusion of Foissner et al. (2002) that terrestrial and limnetic
habitats carry a similar number of species and the estimation of only 3,000 free-living ciliate
species by Finlay & esteban (1998) is a great flaw; 30.000 are more likely (agatha & Foissner
2000).
3.1.2.2 Local centres of ciliate diversity
There is an average of 34 species/sample when the rotten rainforest samples (19, 22, 35, 46, 53)
are excluded. This matches the 28 species/sample in the Namibian study by Foissner et al. (2002).
The small difference is at least partially caused by the increased knowledge of the investigator.
Generally, the number of species varies highly in the individual samples, viz., from 0–126 which
is not surprising considering the variety of biota investigated. The richest sample (126 species) is
close to the 141 species present at the richest Namibian site (Foissner et al. 2002).
Taking into account total species number and the proportion of undescribed species, seven local
ciliate diversity centres can be selected within the region investigated. Fortunately, most are in
protected areas. The richest site (126 species, 9 undescribed) is number (56), i. e., mud and
soil from some flat, ephemeral puddles in the Morrocoy National Park (Table 1). This diversity
matches the Namibian data mentioned above and the 150 species recorded between 1982 and
2012 in an ephemeral pond in Austria (Cotterill et al. 2013).
Site (52) follows, viz., a gallery forest in the Henri Pittier National Park, where 101 species were
recorded of which two (very likely five) were undescribed (Table 1). Gallery (~ floodplain) forest

soils have a high ciliate diversity globally (see Table 8 in Foissner et al. 2002 and Table 2 in
Foissner et al. 2008b). This is corroborated by Foissner et al. (2005a): of 13 sites investigated in
eastern Austria, the highest number of species (120) occurred in a Pruno-Fraxinetum floodplain.
The third rank takes site (61), i. e., rainforest soil from the surroundings of Rancho Grande in the
Henri Pittier National Park (Table 1). We recorded 91 species of which eight were undescribed.
This matches a sample from the Amazon rainforest, where 88 species occurred of which 13 were
undescribed (Foissner 1997). These examples show – not unexpected – a high litter and soil
ciliate diversity in rainforests when the samples are investigated on site or are air-dried and then
investigated with the non-flooded Petri dish method within a few months (Foissner 2011).
The next richest sample is the Mahadja from site (23). We recorded 83 ciliate species three of
which were undescribed (Table 1). As explained in the site description chapter, Mahadjas are
38

fertile, artificial savanna soils. Usually, they contain a significantly higher number of species
than the neighbouring natural soil, except of Mahadja 1 (55 vs. 62 species): Mahadja 2: 59 vs.
37; Mahadja 3: 83 vs. 55; Mahadja 4: 78 vs. 34; Mahadja 5: 37 vs. 25; and Mahadja 6: 48 vs.
12 (Table 1). This is in accordance with many literature data (for reviews, see Foissner 1987b,
1999d). Obviously, fertilization increases the abundance of the “rare biopshere” so that detectable
numbers develop (weisse 2014).
Site (54) follows, i. e., mud and soil from a highly saline, ephemeral coastal puddle in the
Morrocoy National Park. We recorded 78 species of which 10 were undescribed (Table 1). Saline
coastal and inland puddles are poorly studied with respect to ciliates. Thus, the high number of
new species is not surprising. The same can be observed in the saline Etosha Pan in Namibia
(Foissner et al. 2002).
A total of 118 species occurred in the 10 Laja (Lithotelma) samples (Table 2). This matches
numbers reported from ephemeral waters in Europe (for a review, see Cotterill et al. 2013). The
richest Lajas were site 11 (70 species) and site 32 (53 species), both colonized by Velloziaceae
(endemic Liliidae) which favour soil genesis. All other Lajas contained less than 50 species, as
common in similar habitats in Europe (Cotterill et al. 2013, dingFelder 1962). It is remarkable
that nassulid ciliates, which like to feed on filamentous bluegreen bacteria and are thus divers
and frequent in European ephemeral waters, are nearly absent from the Lajas – except of the
cosmopolitans Pseudomicrothorax agilis and Furgasonia theresae – though a lot of bluegreens
occurs there (Fig. 7a–e).
In the four small Galápagos samples 68 species were recorded, at least 13 were undescribed
(Table 3). Most productive was sample (68), i. e., highly saline soil from a Mangrove forest. It
contained 42 species of which seven, possibly even 10 were undescribed (Table 1). Considering
the weakness of the samples, the 13 new species indicate a high number of undescribed ciliates
in Galápagos soils, and rather many might be endemic.
3.1.3 Frequencies and Characteristic Species Communities
252 of the 421 ciliate species identified occur at only one or two sites, showing (i) a very patchy
distribution of most species and (ii) a high proportion of possibly rare species. No species occurred
in all samples, and the euryoecious Colpoda inflata was most frequent, occurring in 73.2% of the
samples (see species list; Fig. 10). Compared to the Namibian soil ciliate community (Foissner et
al. 2002), the single records are slightly higher (120 vs. 177), possibly mainly due to the increased
ability of the investigator in identifying very rare or “difficult” species. However, the frequencies
of the Namibian and Venezuelan soil ciliate communities are very similar to ordinary protist
communities (FenChel 1987, Foissner 2008a) and to those of plants and animals (sChwerdtFeger
1975).
Only 14 species (11 in Namibia) have frequencies ≥ 40%, viz., Platyophrya vorax, Nivaliella
plana, Protocyclidium muscicola, Pseudoplatyophrya nana, Drepanomonas pauciciliata,
Leptopharynx costatus, Pseudocyrtolophosis alpestris, Cyrtolophosis mucicola, Plesiocaryon
elongatum, Gonostomum affine, Colpoda maupasi, Paracolpoda steinii, Colpoda cucullus, and
Colpoda inflata. Most of these species are frequent in soils globally (Table 4) and feed on bacteria,
39

except for the obligate fungivorous N. plana and P. nana; further, most belong to the r-selected,
fast-growing colpodids adapted to utilize short, wet periods in the region and habitats investigated
(Foissner 1987b). Pseudoplatyophrya nana, a minute (25 µm) fungi and yeast feeder, is common
in soils globally while the high frequency of N. plana is shared only with Namibia, a dry region
which has almost the same C/P quotients as the region investigated (0.6 vs. 0.7) and for the most
frequent species (8.0 vs. 10.0; Table 4). This shows that we investigated mainly rather extreme
habitats (Foissner et al. 2002, lüFtenegger et al. 1985).
Interestingly, all Venezuelan species with a frequency of ≥ 40% dominate also in other regions of
the world, suggesting that the list in Table 4 is complete or nearly complete, altogether 46 species.
However, great differences occur, e. g., Exocolpoda augustini in Namibia and Leptopharynx
costatus and Plesiocaryon elongatum in Venezuela. They are highly frequent at only one or
two sites. And only two colpodids occur with high frequency in all communities, viz., Colpoda
inflata and Paracolpoda steinii (Table 4); five further species occur in seven out of the eight
communities investigated (Table 4): Colpoda maupasi (colpodids), Protocyclidium muscicola
(hymenostomatids), Epispathidium terricola (haptorids, one of the few predators in Table
4), Pseudocyrtolophosis alpestris (colpodids), and Pseudoplatyophrya nana (a funigvorous
colpodid). This distribution pattern shows that even euryoecious, cosmopolitan species are not
“globally ubiquitous” as suggested by Finlay et al. (1999).

Condylostomides coeruleus is about 235 µm long and has blueish cortical granules and the macronuclear nodules do not fuse in
the resting cyst. The African C. etoschensis has citrine cortical granules and the macronuclear nodules fuse in the resting cyst
(Foissner et al. 2002).
3.1.4 Not Everything is Everywhere
The distribution problem of microscopic organisms has been controversely discussed (Finlay et
al. 2001, Foissner et al. 2002). Fortunately, two recent compilations of papers from a variety of
microscopic organisms cleared the matter at least partially, showing endemic species embedded
in a mass of cosmopolites (Foissner 2008a, Fontaneto 2011). This supports the “moderate
endemicity model”, i. e., that about one third of protists have restricted distribution while most
are cosmopolites (Foissner 1999c, 2006, 2011).
Based on our investigations on Namibian and Venezuelan soil ciliates, as well as on global soil
ciliate diversity (Chao et al. 2006), we summarize the main issues for a restricted distribution of
part of the soil ciliates as follows:
(i) The main problem is undersampling, i. e., that it is practically impossible to get a complete
species inventory from a certain site or from a certain region because many species are in
cystic state when the investigation takes place. Further, the man power necessary is usually
not available. Thus, a surrogate must be used, i. e., so-called flagship species which are so
distinct that they cannot be overlooked or misidentified (see next item).
(ii) In Figures 11 and 12, we put together some putative flagship species from the Neotropis.
The most impressive examples are Condylostomides etoschensis and → C. coeruleus.
The first is common in the Etosha Pan of Namibia, the second occurs in Central and South
44

America. Both are easily distinguished by the colour of the cortical granules (citrine vs.
blueish like in Stentor coeruleus) and the resting cyst (macronuclear nodules fused vs.
not fused). In our opinion, it is highly unlikely that, if both occur globally, we found them
either only in Africa or in the Neotropis.
(iii) The similarity of global ciliate communities is rather low, viz. 30% to 40 % (Table 5) and
separates the Neotropis clearly from the Holarctic, Palaeotropis and Australis (Fig. 13).
(iv) Often, the wide or cosmopolitan distribution of protists is assumed to be associated with
their small size and high numbers. However, this is disproved by macrofungi, mosses
and ferns, many of which have small areals in spite of appropriate habitats globally and
minute (< 50 µm) spores produced in high numbers (Foissner 2006, 2008a).
(v) The common Gondwanan endemic, Hemimastix amphikineta, a peculiar flagellate, occurs
in Venezuelan samples (11, 14), i.e., in a lithotelma (Laja) and a savanna.

Fig. 13. Cluster analysis for the data shown in Table 5 (from Chao et al. 2006). Over 900 ciliate species were recorded in about
1000 soil samples taken globally. They make a “meaningful” grouping, that is, Gondwanan and Laurasian sites are clearly
distant from the Holarctic sites, showing that not everything is everywhere, i. e., soil ciliates have a biogeography.

3.2.2 Descriptions
Gymnostomatea
The Gymnostomatea were founded by bütsChli (1889) for a group of ciliates with simple
(gymnostomous) oral ciliature. Later, many other names were suggested, such as Litostomatea,
Haptorida, Filicorticata, and Homotricha, for basically the same ciliates. Thus, and for reasons
of stability (International Commission On Zoological Nomenclature 1999), we prefer bütsChli’s
time-honoured name Gymnostomatea.
Gymnostome ciliates are frequent in soils globally, i. e., they count for 18% of the global soil
ciliate diversity (Foissner et al. 2002). Indeed, this is the third place in the global soil ciliate
community (hypotrichs 36%, colpodids 22%). Many gymnostomes are inconspicuous and look
alike at first glance. More detailed analysis, however, reveals quite a lot of organization types,
especially of the circumoral ciliature and the extrusomes, which are highly evolved in this
basically rapacious group of ciliates. This is emphasized by the present study, which discovered
5 new gymnostomatous genera and 24 new species. The great number of rapacious soil ciliates
indicates a high and diverse number of potential food organisms, ranging from protists to small
metazoans, especially rotifers. The morphologial and molecular phylogeny of the Gymnostomatea
is still in its infancy, very likely due to a great number of homoplasies (VďaČný et al. 2014). For
terminology, see Foissner & Xu (2007).
Suborder Trachelophyllina grain, 1994
Diagnosis (from Foissner et al. 2002): Spathidiida Foissner & Foissner, 1988 with lepidosomes
(epicortical scales).
Type family: Trachelophyllidae Kent, 1881.
Families assignable: Trachelophyllidae Kent, 1881; Lingulotrichidae nov. fam.
Nomenclature: This suborder has been established two times, viz., by grain (1994) and Foissner
et al. (2002).
Remarks: We adhere to the diagnosis given above because that of grain (1994) is so unspecified
that it embraces most haptorids. Foissner et al. (2002) established the Trachelophyllina with
a single family, the Trachelophyllidae Kent, 1881, while grain (1994) included also the
Pseudotrachelocercidae song, 1990a. However, the Pseudotrachelocercidae lack epicortical
scales and have a different dorsal brush.
49

Here, we establish a new family for Enchelys-like and Enchelyodon-like haptorids having specific
epicortical scales and a complex, multi-rowed dorsal brush. This requires an emendation of the
diagnosis of the family Trachelophyllidae Kent, 1881, as defined by Foissner et al. (2002).
The data in this monograph markedly broaden the knowledge on trachelophyllid ciliates and
show a considerable diversity of their lepidosomes summarized in Fig. 14 and Table 6.
Family Trachelophyllidae Kent, 1881
Improved diagnosis: Narrowly to cylindroidally (length:width ratio 3–12:1) lagenifrom and
often highly contractile Trachelophyllina grain,1994 with three-rowed dorsal brush: rows 1 and
2 dikinetal, row 3 monokinetal. Several types of three-dimensional lepidosomes: ground scales
of type I or type VII; cover scales of type II, III, IV, V, VI, VIII, IX.
Type genus: Trachelophyllum ClaParède & laChMann,1859.
Genera assignable: Trachelophyllum ClaParède & laChMann, 1859: Ileonema stoKes, 1884b;
Spetazoon Foissner, 1994; Bilamellophrya Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002; Epitholiolus

Ileonema stoKes, 1884b
Improved diagnosis: Ordinarily to cylindroidally lageniform Trachelophyllidae with a
conspicuous, retractable mouth process. Cortex covered with type I and type IV lepidosomes.
Type I on pellicle, elliptical, baseplate finely honeycombed, superstructure dome-shaped and
made of polygons. Type IV in periphery of mucilaginous layer, ampulliform, i. e., with a finely
honeycombed, strongly concave baseplate and a dome-shaped superstructure containing a
filamentous reticulum.
Type species: Ileonema dispar stoKes, 1884b.
Remarks: Ileonema spp. are outstanding haptorids because they have a flagellum-like cytoplasmic
process associated with the oral apparatus. Although several species have been reported, a solid
redescription of any species is not available. Thus, we are proud to close this gap almost 100
years after the last description of a new species by the Swiss protozoologist Penard (1922).
The type species has the mouth process structured in a thick, twisted proximal half and a thin,
thread-like distal half. The other species, including that described here, lack this bipartition,
indicating that they could comprise a distinct genus.
Ileonema chobicola nov. spec. (Fig. 15a–m, 16b–u, 17a–j; Table 7)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 175 × 25 µm; highly contractile. Very narrowly lageniform. 2
globular, distinctly separate macronuclear nodules with a globular micronucleus each. Extrusomes
acicular, about 20 × 0.6 µm. On average 19 ciliary rows. Type I lepidosomes on average 1.5 ×
0.75 × 0.7 µm in size and with 8 polygons in slightly convex superstructure; type IV lepidosomes
ampulliform, 2.1 × 1.3 × 1 µm in size and with 20 polygons in quarter-globular superstructure.
Type locality: Soil from the dry, green bed of the Chobe River near the Muchenje Safari Lodge,
Botswana, 24°40’E 18°S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and
other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species-group name is a composite of chobe (the Botswanan river the species
was discovered), the thematic vowel ·i-, and the Latin verb colere (to live).
Description: Ileonema chobicola is highly variable most coefficients of variation being higher
than 20%, especially continuous features. This might be caused by its pronounced contractility;
however, some discrete features have also coefficients around 20% (Table 7).
Size in vivo 120–225 × 15–35 µm, usually about 175 × 25 µm, as calculated from some live
measurements and the morphometric data (Table 7) adding 25% preparation and contraction
shrinkage for body length (see the high variation coefficients) and 15% for body width. Body
shape trachelophyllid, i. e., very narrowly lageniform with an average length:width ratio of

6.6:1; data from protargol preparations match well those from specimens prepared for scanning
electron microscopy (osmium fixed!); laterally flattened about 2:1 (Fig. 15a, 16b, 17b, c; Table
7). Contractile up to half of body length becoming much stouter and ordinarily lageniform (Fig.
15h); contracts and retracts rather slowly, beginning in mid-body providing cell with a more or
less dumbell-shaped outline (Fig. 17a–c).
Nuclear apparatus in central third of cell, may be dislocated by large food vacuoles, usually
composed of two macronuclear nodules and two globular micronuclei firmly attached to
macronuclear nodules (Fig. 15a, d, 17a–c, e; Table 7); number of macronuclear nodules rather
variable: of 182 randomly selected specimens 12 have one nodule, 167 have two nodules, two
have three nodules, and one has 8 nodules. Macronuclear nodules connected by an argyrophilic
thread, distance between nodules highly variable, spherical to ellipsoidal, usually very broadly
ellipsoidal, contain many minute nucleoli. Contractile vacuole in rear body end, with a single,
large excretory pore (Fig. 15a, d, 16k, 17b). One type of extrusomes, when mature acicular, in
vivo about 18–22 × 0.5–0.7 µm in size, form a refractive bundle attached to oral bulge, partially
extruded in protargol preparations; single and bundled extrusomes 10–20 µm long scattered
throughout cytoplasm (Fig. 15a, b, d, e, 17a–j).
Cortex thin and flexible, contains rows of colourless granules about 0.1 µm across; covered
with an about 1 µm thick, mucilaginous layer of lepidosomes difficult to recognize in vivo and
in protargol preparations (Fig 15a, d, e, g; Table 7). Mucilaginous layer composed of two types
of lepidosomes lying one upon the other and so loosely attached to the cortex that most are lost
during preparation (Fig 15a, g, i–m, 16b, c, e–u; Table 7). Type I lepidosomes in one layer on body
surface, except for oral bulge, 1.5 × 0.75 × 0.7 µm in size and thus hardly recognizable in the light
microscope, domed superstructure with eight polygons on average. Type IV lepidosomes on type
I, ampulliform, 2.1 × 1.3 × 1 µm in size and with 20 polygons in quarter-globular superstructure;
baseplate with stalk-like, central process creating the ampulliform shape together with the domed
superstructure; about half of type IV lepidosomes with a three-dimensional filamentous reticulum
within in superstructure (Fig. 15i–m, 16l–u).
Cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, loosely spaced, arranged in an average of 19 meridionally,
ordinarily spaced rows, three of them differentiated to dorsal brush anteriorly (Fig. 15a, c–f,
16c, e, f, 17a, d, f–j; Table 7). Brush row 1 about half as long as row 2, composed of rather
widely spaced dikinetids bearing about 2 µm long slightly clavate bristles (Fig. 15f) appearing
rod-shaped and of same length in the SEM (Fig. 16c, e, f). Brush row 2 like row 1 but twice as
long and composed of 14 ordinarily spaced dikinetids, those in posterior region with only one
bristle shorter < 1 µm (Fig. 16e). Brush row 3 extends to near posterior body end, composed
of monokinetids with 3 µm long acicular (in vivo) or oblong (SEM, protargol) bristles in some
specimens narrowly spaced anteriorly. All brush rows continue posteriorly as ordinary somatic
kineties.
Oral bulge in vivo rather conspicuous because about 6 × 6 µm in size, indistinctly separate from
body proper and highly refractive due to the extrusomes contained; usually conical, very rarely
discoidal and with distinct central opening, suggesting that this shape occurs just before or after
prey ingestion; opens widely because prey is taken whole (Fig. 15a, e, 16c–g, j, 17a–j; Table 7).
59

Mouth process originates from centre of oral bulge, plasmatic, up to 50 µm long and about 1 µm
thick near oral bulge; very likely cannot beat actively but is dragged posteriorly when cell swims
and whip-like thrown anteriorly when it suddenly stops; withdrawn very rapidly when cell is
disturbed, thus usually not recognizable in fixed specimens; retracts slowly or not at all, at least
in the specimen we observed for half an hour (Fig. 15a, e, 16c, d, j, 17c, d, h–j).
Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, often composed of 25–30 unciliated (!) granules (all basal
bodies?), i. e., a higher number than the 19 ciliary rows; gives rise to delicate fibres extending
anteriorly into the oral bulge and to distinct nematodesmata forming the slightly, conical or
obconical oral basket (Fig. 15a, c–e, 16f, g, j, 17d, h, j).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality where it became abundant in a
raw culture. This indicates that I. chobicola is a limnetic species. Green river beds occur in the
tropics during the dry season. The Chobe River was dry since two months when the sample
was taken from the upper 5 cm of the bed, which was green by grasses and herbs. The soil and
water are highly fertile because both, the wet and the dry river, are densely populated by hippos
and elephants whose fecal masses are scattered over the bed. There was few litter, but the dark
slightly acidic (pH 5.1 in water) and very humic soil contained many grass roots. When rewetted,
the soil becomes a swampy, fine-grained mass difficult to investigate.
Remarks: In his review, Kahl (1930a) reported only three Ileonema species. Ileonema dispar
stoKes, 1884b has only one (vs. two) macronuclear nodule and is much stouter than I. chobicola
(length:width ratio about 3:1 vs. 6.6:1).
Ileonema simplex, of which Penard (1922) found only a single specimen in a Sphagnum
upholstery, has also only one (vs. two) macronuclear nodule. This has been confirmed (Fig. 16a)
by KreutZ & Mayer (2000) and KreutZ & Foissner (2006). Thus, I. simplex is clearly different
from I. chobicola.
Ileonema ciliata (rouX, 1901) Kahl, 1930a resembles I. chobicola in body shape and in having
two macronuclear nodules. However, it is much smaller (in vivo ~ 75 × 14 µm vs. ~ 160 × 25
µm) and slightly stouter (~ 5.3:1 vs. 6.6:1). Very likely, further differences exist but cannot be
settled because the description of rouX (1901) is very brief. Ileonema ciliata has been reported
by several authors, e. g., by ChoriK & viKol (1973) in a cooling plant in Moldavia and in Mexico
by raMireZ de guerrero (1970) who misidentified a small (80 × 15 µm), monomacronucleate
Ileonema as I. ciliata rouX.
Spetazoon Foissner, 1994
Improved diagnosis: Trachelophyllidae Kent, 1881 with type VII and type VIII lepidosomes
whose superstructure is made of pierced planks. Type VII on pellicle, composed of a finely
honeycombed, elliptical baseplate from which a widely and polygonally faceted, dome-shaped
superstructure emerges. Type VIII lepidosomes ampulliform, composed of a finely honeycombed,
strongly concave, elliptical baseplate associated with a widely and polygonally faceted,
hemispherical superstructure filled with a three-dimensional net of filaments.
Type species: Spetazoon australiense Foissner, 1994.
60

Remarks: The diagnosis has been adapted to Foissner (2005) and to the new results on the
lepidosomes.
We rediscovered S. australiense in a soil sample from the floodplain of the Murray River near
to the town of Albury, southern Australia while the type population has been discovered in a soil
sample from the bottom of the Fogg Dam in the surroundings of the town of Darwin, northern
Australia (Foissner 1994). The Murray River specimens were very similar to those from the type
population. Thus, we reinvestigated only the epicortical scales (lepidosomes), which Foissner
(1994) studied with an insufficient method (air-drying) and described as spherical structures
composed of a hexagonally faceted external layer and a honeycombed internal layer. Critical-
point drying showed much more details although the rough surface view is quite similar (cp. Fig.
22n–p with Fig. 20–22 in Foissner 1994).
Spetazoon australiense has type VII and type VIII lepidosomes (for types, see Foissner 2005 and
the present study, Fig. 14). The lepidosomes are shown by a multitude of SEM micrographs (Fig.
22d, e–u, 23a–g). Thus, the description will be short.

The type VII lepidosomes are elliptical, rarely broadly elliptical and lie on the pellicle in one or
two layers (Fig. 22i–m). The flat baseplate is finely hexagonally faceted while the superstructure
is coarsely polygonally faceted and has a feature not yet observed in the type I scales of other
species: the central facete(s) is composed of pierced planks (Fig. 22l, m). The average size is 2.3
× 1.3 × 0.6 µm in the scanning electron microscope, showing that the superstructure is very flat
(Fig. 23a; Table 8).
61

The type VIII lepidosomes, which have an average size of 3 × 2.3 × 2.2 µm (Table 8) in the
SEM, are ampulliform, i. e., have a blunt stalk and a hemispherical cap resembling the type IV
lepidosomes of → Ileonema (Fig. 22d–h, n–q, 23a–g). They lie on the type VII lepidosomes in one
or two layers. The baseplate has a strongly convex central area and is finely hexagonally faceted
while the hemispherical superstructure is coarsely polygonally faceted. The superstructure is
made of polygons composed of pierced planks and contains a three-dimensional net of filaments
recognizable only at high magnification (Fig. 22r–u, 23c, d, f, g). A reinterpretation of the
lepidosomes of other species showed that the type V lepidosomes of Sleighophrys pustulata
contain a similar net (Fig. 31–33 in Foissner 2005).
Spetazoon australiense Foissner, 1994
Improved diagnosis: Size in vivo about 265 × 60 µm, contractile by about 40% of body
length. Lageniform with bluntly pointed posterior end; distinctly flattened dorsoventrally. Two
ellipsoidal, widely distant macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. Extrusomes distinctly
acicular, about 20 × 1 µm in size. On average 31 ciliary rows; dorsal brush isostichad. Type VII
lepidosomes about 2.3 × 1.3 × 0.6 µm in SEM preparations, dome composed of an average of nine
large polygons; type VIII lepidosomes about 3 × 2.3 × 2.2 µm in SEM preparations, baseplate
with conspicuous central convexity, dome composed of an average of 19 large polygons.
Remarks: The diagnosis has been adapted to Foissner (2005) and to the new data on the
lepidosomes. We did not reinvestigate the species, except of the lepidosomes, because the in vivo
aspect was very similar to that of the type specimens.
However, we observed this or a similar species in sample (56) from Venezuela. These specimens
looked quite similar to the Australian ones in vivo (cp. Fig. 22a, b, f–h with Fig. 1, 3, 17–19 in
Foissner 1994), except of the extrusomes, which were shorter (about 15 µm vs. 20 µm) and less
distinctly acicular (Fig. 22c). Protargol preparations showed (Tables 8, 10) that the Venezuelan
specimens are shorter (210 µm vs. 265 µm in vivo) and have a lower, non-overlapping number
of ciliary rows (24 vs. 31). Thus, we cannot exclude that the Venezuelan population is at least a
distinct subspecies. Unfortunately, we studied the lepidosomes of the Venezuelan specimens only
in the light microscope (Fig. 22a, b), where they appeared quite similar to those of the Australian
populations.
We deposited three slides with protargol-impregnated specimens from the Venezuelan population
in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Some well-impregnated cells
are marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Spetazoon australiense: description of an Austrian population (Fig. 18a–m,
19a–x, 20a–k; Tables 9, 10)
Material and Remarks: Spetazoon australiense was found in August and November 2004 in
the mud of a flooded meadow in the surroundings of the railway station “village of Selker”, near
to the town of Kefermarkt, Upper Austria, 48°48’N 15°14’E. This is a site of the Meseres study
(weisse et al. 2008). We deposited 4 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens in the
Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI).

Description: Spetazoon australiense is rather variable because most variation coefficients are >
15%, including those from the lepidosomes (Table 9). Part of the variability of the continuous
features is very likely caused by the contractility of the cells. As usual, the number of ciliary
rows is little variable (CV = 5.1%) and thus an important feature for species recognition. The
description is based on slowly growing specimens from a raw culture set up with tap water and
some squashed wheat kernels.
Size in vivo about 290 × 45 µm and about 290 × 65 µm in protargol slides when 25% are added
for length shrinkage due to partial contraction and preparation shrinkage while only 15% for
body width because cells generally tend to become slightly inflated in preparations (Table 9); in
vivo contractile by about 30% of body length; length:width ratio highly variable (3–8:1; Table
9), very likely due to a more or less strong contraction when cells are fixed. Body lageniform to
very slenderly lageniform both in vivo (6.3:1 on average) and in protargol preparations (4.1:1),
widest in or slightly posterior of mid-body, neck distinct and usually slightly curved producing
an inconspicuous shoulder, posterior end bluntly pointed even in contracted specimens (Fig.
18a, c, i–m, 19a–c, e, k; Table 9). Nuclear apparatus on average in central quarters of cell (Fig.
18a, c, 19e, k, s, t; Table 9). Macronuclear nodules in about half of specimens in slightly oblique
pattern (Fig. 19e), connected by an argyrophilic strand; globular to ellipsoid, on average broadly
ellipsoid, only one nodule in two out of 21 cells investigated; nucleoli granular, numerous. On
average six conspicuous micronuclei near and attached to macronuclear nodules, ellipsoid,
elongate ellipsoid, ovate or lageniform, usually ellipsoid (2:1) to elongate ellipsoid (≥ 3:1), in
vivo bright because compact, about 11 × 4 µm in size. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end,
with large subterminal excretory pore (Fig. 18a, c, j, 19g, k). Two types of extrusomes attached
to oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm (Fig. 18a, d, f, g, 19e, h, i, j, l; Table 9): type I acicular
and more or less curved, on average 18 × 0.9 µm in size; type II minute, i. e., only 2–3 µm long.
Cytoplasm colourless and densely granulated, contains few to many globular and irregular, highly
refractive lipid droplets up to 15 µm in size (Fig. 18a, 19c, e). Feeds on Vorticella convallaria
(Fig. 19e). Glides slowly on bottom of Petri dish or swims slowly rotating about main body axis.
Cortex highly flexible, slightly ribbed right of ciliary rows (Fig. 19p), about 1 µm thick, contains
innumerable granules smaller than 0.5 µm in narrowly spaced rows (Fig. 18b, 19q), covered
by a mucilaginous layer 3–5 µm thick in vivo (Fig. 18a–c, 19k, m, n, o, r). Mucilaginous layer
composed of slime and two types of lepidosomes both staining with alcain blue suggesting acid
mucopolysaccharides as a main component (Foissner 2009). Lepidosomes of “complex type”,
i. e., superstructure made of planks pierced by quadrangular or polygonal meshes. Type VII
lepidosomes 1.9 × 1.1 × 0.6 µm in the scanning electron microscope, very hyaline and thus hardly
recognizable in the light microscope although having about double size in vivo; composed of an
elliptical, finely honeycombed baseplate and a rather flat superstructure with an average of nine
polygons the central one(s) made of pierced planks (Fig. 18b, 19u–x, 20f–h, 21a, b, d, e; Table
9). Type VIII lepidosomes on type VII in two layers, 2.6 × 1.8 × 1.9 µm in the scanning electron
microscope, well recognizable in the light microscope appearing spherical or hemispherical with
a diameter of 3–4 µm (Fig. 18b, 19n, o, r); composed of a circular or broadly elliptical, finely
honeycombed baseplate and a complex hemispherical superstructure with polygons made of
planks pierced quadrangularly or polygonally; superstructure filled with a three-dimensional,
irregular net made of filaments (Fig. 18b, c, 19a, b, n, o, r, 20a–d, i–k; Table 9).

Cilia about 15 µm long in vivo, loosely spaced, proximal third motionless due to the mucilaginous
layer; arranged in an average of 37 equidistantly, narrowly spaced, meridional rows two
differentiated to a dikinetal dorsal brush anteriorly. Dikinetal brush rows isostichad, bristles up
to 6 µm long and likely structured as shown in Fig. 18h; brush row 3 composed of monokinetids
with rod-shaped bristles about 4 µm long in vivo, extends to near posterior body end (Fig. 18a,
c, e, 19p; Table 9).
Oral bulge about 4 × 4 µm in vivo while 7 × 4.5 µm in protargol preparations; rectangular in vivo,
bluntly conical after protargol impregnation, discoidal in SEM preparations (Fig. 18a, c, e, 19e,
f; Table 9). Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids.
Pharynx tubular, slightly divergent (Fig. 19m).
Comparison of Australian and Austrian population (Table 10): It was a great surprise to find
this Australian species in Austria. On the other hand, the trachelophyllids were so poorly known
in 1994 that such “discoveries” have to be expected. Although we did not find really distinct
differences between the Australian and Austrian populations, we provided a full description of
the later because refined methods might find significant differences in future.
The data in Table 10 show a good agreement of the Australian and the Austrian population of S.
australiense although the number of ciliary rows, which is an important feature due to its low

variability (CV ≤ 5%), hardly overlaps. This is corroborated by the type VIII lepidosomes. In the
Austrian specimens, they contain an irregular, filamentous reticulum (Fig. 20e, j, k, 21d) while
two subtypes occur in the Australian specimens: one is very similar to the Austrian pattern (Fig.
21d, 22q, s, 23c, f) while the other occurs only in Australia and is characterized by straight,
thread-like filaments (Fig. 21c, f, 22r, t, u, 23d, g). On the other hand, the Venezuelan population,
which has only 24 ciliary rows and slightly different extrusomes, is very likely a distinct species.
As concerns body shape, we are convinced that Figure 1 in Foissner (1994) shows a slightly
contracted specimen (Fig. 18i) because the shape of protargol-impregnated specimens is virtually
identical in the Australian and the Austrian cells.

scanning electron micrographs. The arrows in the type VII lepidosomes mark the pierced planks in the central facete. For details,
see text.
Splitters would possibly separate the Australian and Austrian population at subspecies level while
lumpers will argue that other important features match very well, e. g., the shape and size of the
extrusomes and the dorsal brush. We suggest to study further populations before separation.
Spetazoon australiense, a junior synonym of Trachelophyllum vestitum stoKes, 1884a? The
description of stoKes is rather detailed but misses, understandably, important details, such as
the number of ciliary rows, the structure of the dorsal brush, and the length of the extrusomes
(Fig. 18n). However, there are three features that match (Fig. 18a, d): body length in vivo (~
290 and 250 µm), the shape of the extrusomes (acicular), and the thick mucilaginous layer. But
there are two problems: body shape and extrusome length. Body shape is a difficult feature in the
contractile trachelophyllids: it is clavate and 3.5:1 according to the illustration of stoKes (Fig.
18m) while the description states: “the length from four to five times the breadth”. Thus, stoKes
illustrated a more or less contracted specimen. However, we never saw cells with a shape like that
illustrated by stoKes in the Australian and Austrian populations, suggesting that it is a different
North American species. This is corroborated by the length of the extrusomes: about 58 µm
according to the illustration of stoKes, only 20 µm in the Australian and Austrian cells.
Trachelophyllides nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Trachelophyllidae Kent, 1881 with type I, IV, and IX lepidosomes. Type I on pellicle,
composed of a finely honeycombed, elliptical baseplate from which a widely and polygonally
faceted, slightly convex superstructure emerges. Type IV mixed with type IX, ampulliform,
composed of a finely honeycombed, elliptical, moderately concave baseplate from which a widely
and polygonally faceted, convex superstructure emerges containing a filamentous network.
Type IX on type I lepidosomes, mushroom-shaped with comparatively long and thick, finely
honeycombed stalk and trapeziform cap composed of large polygons and containing a three-
dimensional net of filaments and membranoid structures.

of an average of 19 polygons while the convex baseplate is finely faceted. Within the superstructure are special filaments shown
on the next plate. CI – ordinary somatic cilia. Scale bars 3 µm.

Type species: Trachelophyllum sigmoides Kahl, 1926.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the genus-group name Trachelophyllum and the Greek
suffix ides (similar), referring to the similarity with Trachelophyllum. Masculine gender.
Species assignable: Monotypic!
Remarks: As yet, T. sigmoides is the sole trachelophyllid with three types of lepidosomes, of
which type IX is unique justifying a distinct genus. For further details, see Remarks to genus →
Spetazoon.
Trachelophyllides sigmoides (Kahl, 1926) nov. comb. (Fig. 24a–w, 25a–v, 26a–x;
Table 11)
The redescription is based on a population from a Sphagnum pond in the southeast of Germany
(for details, see KreutZ & Foissner 2006). We thank Dr. Martin KreutZ for sending material
several times. Unfortunately, this species was always very rare, as stated also by Kahl (1926,
1930a), and thus we could impregnate only a few specimens because most cells were used for live
observation and scanning electron microscopy.
Improved diagnosis (contains also data from Kahl): Size in vivo about 350 × 65 µm; contractile
by about 30% of body length. Asymmetrically lageniform with slightly curved anterior region
and bluntly pointed posterior end; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1. 2 broadly ellipsoid, widely
distant macronuclear nodules each with several globular to broadly ellipsoidal micronuclei. 2
types of extrusomes attached to oral bulge: type I rod-shaped and slightly curved, ~ 50 × 0.5 µm in
vivo; type II rod-shaped to indistinctly acicular, ~ 5 × 0.4 µm in vivo. Usually green by symbiotic
algae. About 40 ciliary rows; dorsal brush isostichad. Lepidosomes and slime produce a 5–7 µm
thick mucilaginous layer easily recognizable in vivo. Type I lepidosomes discoid, in the SEM 1.6
× 0.7 × 0.5 µm and with 5 large polygons in superstructure on average; type IV ampulliform, 2.4
× 1.1 × 1.1 µm in size and with 8 polygons in superstructure; type IX mushroom-shaped, 2.5 ×
1.9 × 2.4 µm in sized and with 8 polygons in superstructure.
Type locality: Sapropelic ponds in the surroundings of the town of Hamburg, Germany (Kahl
1926, 1930).
Type material: Not available. We deposited 2 voucher slides with some protargol-impregnated
specimens from the Simmelried in Germany in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Greek adjective sigmoides (S-shaped) refers to the curved anterior region which
causes a slightly sigmoid outline (Kahl 1926).
Description: Size in vivo 250–480 × 40–90 µm matching well the 250–400 × 60–70 µm reported
by Kahl (1926, 1930a); usually about 350 × 65 µm, length:width ratio thus 5.4:1 on average (Table
11); up to 10:1 according to a figure by Kahl (1926) here reproduced as Fig. 24u; contractile by
about 30% of body length, e. g., 400 × 80 µm when extended and 350 × 90 µm when contracted
79

or 300 × 60 µm and 250 × 70 µm; contracts and extends very slowly with movements resembling
euglenid metaboly (Fig. 24f). Basically lageniform but anterior region usually more or less curved
making cells slightly sigmoid and asymmetric; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1, depending
on amount of food ingested (Fig. 24a–c, 25a, b, f, h); when moderately contracted elongate
quadrangular or indistinctly dumbell-shaped (Fig. 24f); fully contracted cells broadly lenticular,
i. e., with a length:width ratio of about 2:1.
Nuclear apparatus in central quarters of cell (Fig. 24a, c, 25a, b, f–h, p). Macronuclear nodules
connected by a fine strand, broadly ellipsoid, in vivo about 30 × 25 µm; with many minute
nucleoli ≤ 1 µm across. Several micronuclei attached and near to macronuclear nodules, broadly
ellipsoid or indistinctly pyramidal, about 6 × 5 µm in vivo. Contractile vacuole in posterior end,
with large, tubular excretory pore in or near pole centre (Fig. 24a, f, 25a, b, d, e, f, h). Two types
of extrusomes attached to oral bulge and scattered throughout cytoplasm (Fig. 24a, d, e, h, 25c, f,
l, p, t, 26a–f; Table 11). Type I extrusomes filiform with rounded ends, slightly curved and very
flexible, 35–65 × 0.4–0.6 µm in vivo, usually about 50 × 0.5 µm; make a thick, conspicuous
bundle in oral area and thin bundles in cytoplasm; when extruded of typical toxicyst structure
and about 100 µm long. Type II extrusomes rod-shaped to indistinctly acicular, make a highly
refractive ring in oral bulge, 5–8 × 0.3–0.4 µm in vivo (Fig. 24a, e, h, 26c–e); produce small
bundles in cytoplasm. Cytoplasm usually green due to symbiotic algae (Chlorella sp.) 5–6 × 4–5
µm in size and without eyespot, rarely cells without or with few symbiotic algae. Algae bleach
within a few minutes in squashed Trachelophyllides while those of Pseudoblepharisma do not,
indicating that the chlorellas of T. sigmoides could be cleptoplasts. This is corroborated by a

specimen where most algae were within fatty-appearing globules up to 30 µm across (Fig. 24a,
25v). Cells sometimes spotted, i. e., green and reddish when feeding on rhodobacteria colonies
digested in vacuoles 20–30 µm across (Fig. 24a, 25e); feeds also on protists, such as euglenids
and ciliates and thus frequently studded with lipid droplets 1–10 µm across (Fig. 24a, i, 25a–i, p,
v). Glides slowly to rather rapidly on and in the Sphagnum mud slowly rotating about main body
axis.
Cell and cortex very flexible, contains stripes composed of one to four rows of narrowly
spaced, colourless granules about 0.5 µm in size (Fig. 24g, i, 25u); covered by a 5–7 µm thick,
mucilaginous layer composed of slime and lepidosomes easily recognizable in vivo, even
at moderate magnification (~ 250×; Fig. 24a, i, 25a–i, p, t, 26f). Three types of very fragile
lepidosomes shrinking about 100% in SEM preparations (Fig. 24j–q, 25j, m–o, q, s, 26g–x; Table
11). Type I lepidosomes on pellicle, conspicuously ellipsoid and very thin, i. e., 1.6 × 0.7 × 0.5
µm on average; baseplate finely honeycombed, surrounded by a ring of quadrangular meshes, flat
or slightly convex; dome (superstructure) slightly convex and composed of five large polygons
on average (Fig. 24j, k, 26i–m). Type IV lepidosomes rare and mixed with type IX, ampulliform
with short “stalk” and rather flat superstructure, conspicuously ellipsoid, i. e., 2.4 × 1.1 × 1.1
µm on average; baseplate finely honeycombed and moderately concave; dome quarter-globular,
composed of eight polygons on average, contains a three-dimensional net of filaments (Fig. 24l,
m, 25k, 26m, u, x). Type IX lepidosomes in two or more layers at periphery of mucilaginous coat,
mushroom-shaped in lateral view, broadly ellipsoidal in polar views, in vivo 3–5 × 2–3 µm and thus
well recognizable in the light microscope (Fig 24i, 25m–o, q, s), in SEM preparations shrunken
to 2.5 × 1.9 × 2.4 µm on average. Baseplate membranoid and with conspicuous central, finely
honeycombed stalk about as long as dome height; superstructure (mushroom cap) trapeziform
in lateral view, composed of an average of eight polygons distally slightly projecting forming
a pentagonal or hexagonal central polygon; polygons frequently “closed” by a membranoid
structure; cap contains an irregular network of filaments and membranous structures (Fig. 24i,
n–q, 25k, 26h, n–t, v, w).
Cilia in vivo 17–20 µm long, arranged in about 40 meridional, equidistant rows, as typical for
trachelophyllids; proximal third of cilia immobile because constrained by the mucilaginous layer.
Two rows anteriorly modified to an isostichad, dikinetal dorsal brush with up to 8 µm long bristles
(Fig. 24r); left of dikinetal rows one (rarely possibly two) monokinetal row extending beyond
mid-body with acicular, 8 µm long bristles; all brush kineties continue posteriorly as ordinary
somatic ciliary rows.
Oral bulge in vivo only about 3 µm high and hardly separate from neck, emphasized also by Kahl
(1926, 1930a, b), slightly concave and covered by a thin mucilaginous layer. Circumoral kinety
at base of oral bulge, made of very narrowly spaced dikinetids each bearing a 20 µm long cilium.
Oral basket tubular (Fig. 24a, c, h, f, 25a–c, f, h, t, 26f, g).
Occurrence and ecology: Common in sapropelic ponds in the surroundings of Hamburg,
Germany, also during winter; usually rare, occasionally rather abundant and very slowly moving,
possibly some sort of prolonged digestion (Kahl 1926, 1930a, b). We know T. sigmoides only
from sapropelic ponds in the Simmelried, as mentioned in the introduction to the description.
There are few reports of this species, and some might be misidentifications. nauwerCK (1996)

reported T. sigmoides from the pelagial of a small lake (Höllerersee) in Upper Austria. MueCKe
(1979) found it in ponds of the “Heiliges Meer” in Germany. vuXanoviCi (1962) reported it
from a basin of the Botanical Garden in Bucharest, Rumania (but see Remarks). Pratt et al.
(1987) observed it in spring in the Flint River and Lake Blackshear impoundment, southwestern
Georgia, USA. shiZheng & ZhengXue (1994) found it in one out of eleven industrial sewage
plants, Qinghai province, China.
Remarks: Our observations match those of Kahl (1926, 1930a, b, 1943), who provided four
slightly different figures over the years (Fig. 24t–w), almost perfectly, including the length of
the type I extrusomes (~ 48 µm according to Fig. 24v). Thus we do not neotypify the species.
The sole remarkable difference is the dikinetal dorsal brush which extends beyond mid-body
according to Kahl (Fig. 24v) while it is only about 65 µm long in our population (Fig. 24a, r).
Possibly, Kahl (1930a, b) saw only the monokinetal brush row 3 which, indeed, extends beyond
mid-body.
We found only one other illustration of T. sigmoides in the literature (vuXanoviCi 1962).
Unfortunately, the figure explanation appears incorrect providing a body size of only 32 µm,
and the text describes the extrusomes and the dorsal brush as only 18 µm and 15 µm long,
respectively. Thus, we cannot be sure about this population although the shape of the body and
oral bulge matches Kahl´s figures very well (cp. Fig. 24t–w with Fig. 24x–z).
There is only one species, → Spetazoon australiense, which might be confused with T. sigmoides
because it has a similar size and shape of the body and a thick mucilaginous layer. However, it
differs by the shape of the micronuclei (ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid vs. globular to broadly
ellipsoid), the shape and length of the type I extrusomes (distinctly acicular and 20 µm long vs.
filiform and 50 µm long), the symbiotic algae (absent vs. present), the oral bulge (distinct vs.
indistinct), and the lepidosomes (types VII, VIII vs. types I, IV, IX). As concerns Trachelophyllum
vestitum, see → Spetazoon australiense.
Trachelophyllum apiculatum (Perty, 1852) ClaParède and laChMann, 1859 (Fig.
28a–g)
The Venezuelan population from mosses of the Henri Pittier National Park matches the redescription
by Foissner et al. (2002) only partially and emphasizes the variability of the species. Body size
about 100 × 20 µm, contractile by about 1/3; excretory pore large and in centre of posterior pole;
extrusomes rod-shaped, about 16 × 0.3–0.4 µm in size (Fig. 28a); lepidosomes (Fig. 28b–d)
rather similar to those of the Venezuelan site (54) neotype population described by Foissner
et al. (2002), i. e., 1.3 × 0.8 × 0.7 µm (n = 15) in size and with 6 polygons in hemispherical
superstructure.
There is a single, possibly important difference: the specimens of this population have not only
long extrusomes but also very minute ones (~ 2 µm long) in the oral bulge (Fig. 28c). They
are difficult to recognize, suggesting that they have been overlooked previously. Further, the
lepidosomes, although having the same size as those from the neotype, have only 6 (vs. 11)
polygons in the superstructure. See also → T. tachyblastum.

Trachelophyllum tachyblastum stoKes, 1884a (Fig. 29a–l, 30a–n; Table 12)
Improved diagnosis: Size in vivo about 120 × 17 µm; lageniform to slenderly lageniform.
2 broadly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules with a globular micronucleus each. Two types of
extrusomes: type I rod-shaped to indistinctly acicular and slightly curved, 12–16 µm long; type
II oblong, about 2 µm long. On average 11 ciliary rows; dorsal brush heterostichad, rows 1 and
2 with an average of 5 and 11 dikinetids, respectively. Lepidosomes about 1.8 × 1.2 × 1 µm and
with an average of 8 polygons in hemispherical superstructure.
Neotype locality: Leaf litter and soil from the Fern Creek, Muir National Park, San Francisco,
USA, W122°5’ N37°5’.
Neotype material: 4 neotype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited
in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The neotype specimen and
other relevant cells have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Greek tachyblastos means sprouting quickly (stoKes 1884a).
Description: Size in vivo 90–140 × 10–25 µm, usually about 120 × 17 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 12 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage; length:width ratio also highly variable, i. e., 5–11:1, on average around 7:1 both in
vivo and in protargol preparations (Table 12); up to 2:1 flattened dorsoventrally, depending on
nutrition state. Lageniform to slenderly lageniform with neck slightly widened in oral region
and gradually merging into broadened trunk, both ends narrowly rounded (Fig. 29a, c, d, 30a,
m). Cells very flexible but only slightly (< 20%) contractile, mainly in neck region, preserved
specimens thus of similar size and shape as live ones (Fig. 29a, d). Nuclear apparatus on average
in posterior half of body, i. e., in mid of trunk (Fig. 29a, d, 30m; Table 12). Macronuclear nodules
globular to slenderly ellipsoidal (3:1), on average 11 × 6 µm in protargol preparations, usually
distinctly apart and connected by a fine strand; very rarely almost abutting. A micronucleus each
attached to macronuclear nodules, globular to broadly ellipsoidal, about 2 µm in size. Contractile
vacuole in posterior body end, with tubular pore in pole centre. Two types of extrusomes attached
to oral bulge, their cytoplasmic developmental stages impregnate rather deeply with protargol
(Fig. 29a, e–g, 30e, h, k, l): type I conspicuous because 12–16 × ~ 0.3 µm, rod-shaped and
slightly curved, in one specimen very slightly acicular; type II inconspicuous because only about
2 × 0.4 µm in size. Cytoplasm hyaline, with few to many lipid droplets up to 5 µm across,
depending on nutrition state. Glides slowly on microscope slide.
Cortex flexible, contains scattered, colourless granules ≤ 0.3 µm across (Fig. 29l); and a fibre
system as described in T. apiculatum by Foissner et al. (2002). Mucilaginous layer in vivo very
hyaline, about 2 µm thick and composed of globular lepidosomes 1.5–2 µm across (Fig. 29a),
impregnate rather deeply with protargol (Fig. 29d, 30i, j). Lepidosomes of Trachelophyllum
structure (Foissner et al. 2002), on average 1.8 × 1.2 × 1 µm in size and with 8 polygons in
hemispherical superstructure; baseplate and dish margin finely faceted, central area slightly
concave (Fig. 29h–j, 30a–d, f, g; Table 12).
Cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, widely spaced, some non-ciliated granules (kinetids?) in line

with ciliated ones. On average 11 ordinarily to narrowly spaced ciliary rows meridionally and
equidistantly arranged, three of them differentiated to dorsal brush anteriorly (Fig. 29a, d, 30h,
m, n; Table 12). Dorsal brush heterostichad because row 1 about half as long as row 2, composed
of an average of five widely spaced dikinetids; row 2 composed of 11 ordinarily to widely spaced
dikinetids; bristles of both rows about 4 µm long in vivo and arranged as described by Foissner et
al. (2002) in T. costaricanum. Brush row 3 extends to near mid-body, composed of monokinetids

with 3–4 µm long, immobile bristles projecting at right angles from body proper (Fig. 30n).
Oral bulge rather conspicuous in vivo because about 5 × 4 µm in size and glossy due to the
extrusomes attached, distinctly separate from body proper, usually covered by lepidosomes. Bulge
shape highly variable (Fig. 29a, c, d, 30c, h–j; Table 12): distinctly to indistinctly pentagonal in 11
out of 21 specimens analysed and cylindroid with distal surface sometimes obliquely truncate in
10 cells; rarely button-shaped or obconical. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of
about 10 comparatively widely spaced dikinetids each having a single cilium and a nematodesma
contributing to the tubercular oral basket (Fig. 29d, k, 30j, m).
Occurrence and ecology: stoKes (1884a) discovered T. tachyblastum in decaying mud of shallow
pools in the surroundings of the town of Trenton, Philadelphia, USA. Our neotype is from the
opposite side of the continent, i. e., from the Muir National Park in San Francisco. The sample
was taken above the Redwood zone on the left slope of the Fern Creek. There is mixed forest
with an up to 10 cm thick leaf litter layer, which was collected together with some mineral soil;
pH 6.1 in water. A further record is from Venezuelan site (52) where T. tachyblastum occurred
in soil from a gallery forest. The specimens from this site are slightly smaller than those from
the neotype locality but otherwise they match perfectly. Possibly, T. tachyblastum occurs also in
soil from Austria, where Foissner (1984) misidentified it as T. apiculatum (for a brief review, see
Foissner et al. 2002).
98

Comparison with original description and neotypification: The description and illustration
of T. tachyblastum by stoKes (1884a) is rather meagre, showing the following features (Fig.
29b): body length 127–152 µm; body clavate, about eight to ten times as long as broad (but only
6:1 in the figure!); two macronuclear nodules and a contractile vacuole; rather long, rod-shaped
extrusomes; oral bulge obtusely rounded.
We neotypify T. tachyblastum although the differences between T. tachyblastum and → T.
apiculatum are rather prominent, especially the dorsal brush, they are not easily distinguished
because they have a similar body and extrusome shape and size. Further, T. apiculatum possibly
consists of two or more species.
Remarks: Kahl (1930a) synonymized T. tachyblastum with T. apiculatum. Indeed, these species
are highly similar in vivo. However, when compared with the Venezuelan neotype established
by Foissner et al. (2002), the following differences can be recognized (listed by importance): (i)
dorsal brush (row 1 with 5 vs. 18 dikinetids, row 2 with 11 vs. 22 dikinetids); (ii) with vs. without
short (type II) extrusomes; (iii) lepidosomes larger although the body is smaller (1.8 × 1.2 ×1 µm
vs. 1.3 × 0.8 µm; 8 vs. 11 polygons in superstructure, Fig. 29h–j, m–p); (iv) body smaller (90–140
× 10–25 µm vs. 130–200 × 20–30 µm). These features, especially the small brush, are sufficient
to accept both species.
Bilamellophrya fraterculus nov. spec. (Fig. 31a–e, 32a–l; Table 12)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 × 20 µm in vivo, contractile up to 30%; slenderly lageniform. 2
broadly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules widely apart and with an ellipsoid micronucleus each.
Extrusomes cylindroid, about 1 µm long. On average 13 ciliary rows; dikinetal dorsal brush
rows isostichad, both composed of about 22 kinetids. Mucilaginous layer 1–2 µm thick. Type I
lepidosomes on average 1.3 × 0.8 µm and with 6 polygons in superstructure. Type II lepidosomes
about 1.9 × 1.2 × 1.4 µm, conical superstructure composed of an average of 12 scattered polygons
tapering to 1 or 2 oblong peaks.
Type locality: Upper, slightly saline (8‰) soil layer of a small grass island in the mangrove forest
about 10 km west of the town of Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, 70°35′W 19°50′N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin name fraterculus (small brother) is a noun in apposition, referring to the
similarity with B. etoschensis from Southwest Africa, Namibia (Foissner et al. 2002).
Description: About half of the specimens have a clear cytoplasm without food vacuoles and are
thus more slender than the cells with food vacuoles. Furthermore, the macronuclear nodules are
usually nearer together and more slender. Thus, the variability coefficients are high for body width,
the length of the macronuclear nodules, and the distance in between the nodules. Nonetheless, we
included these – possibly precystic – specimens in the morphometric analysis (Table 12).
99

Size 130–180 × 15–25 µm in vivo, usually about 150 × 20 µm; length: width ratio 4–9.7:1, on
average 6.9:1, that is, very wide due to the slender specimens mentioned above. Shape slenderly
to very slenderly lageniform, specimens without food vacuoles frequently almost rod-shaped;
neck slightly widened at base of oral bulge (Fig. 31a, 32a); laterally flattened up to 3:1. Contracted
cells narrowly to very narrowly ellipsoid and slightly curved (Fig. 32e). Nuclear apparatus on
average posterior of mid-body, likely due to the specimens without food vacuoles where the
macronuclear nodules move slightly backwards (Fig. 31a, c, 32a; Table 12). Invariably, two
widely separate macronuclear nodules and two micronuclei attached to or a few µm away from
nodules. Individual macronuclear nodules globular to ellipsoidal, on average broadly ellipsoidal;
contain many nucleoli 1–2 µm across. Micronuclei discoidal to hemispherical (Fig. 31a, c; Table
12); three micronuclei in one out of 30 specimens. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end,
with large excretory pore in pole centre (Fig. 31a, c). Extrusomes attached to oral bulge, very
inconspicuous because only 1 µm long (Fig. 31a, b, 32c); do not impregnate with the protargol
method used. Cytoplasm colourless, contains food vacuoles 4–8 µm across and few to many lipid
droplets. Glides and swims rather rapidly.
Cortex as in congeners (Foissner et al. 2002), covered by a 1–2 µm thick layer of slime and
lepidosomes, producing a slightly serrate body margin both in vivo and in protargol preparations
(Fig. 31a). Mucilaginous layer contains two kinds of lepidosomes lying one upon the other (Fig.
31e, 32d–l; Table 12). Type 1 lepidosomes in one layer on body surface, circular to ellipsoidal,
on average 1.3 × 0.8 µm in size and thus hardly recognizable in the light microscope, domed
superstructure with 6 polygons on average. Type II lepidosomes complex and beautiful, upon and
rather tightly arranged on type 1 scales, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, on average 1.9 × 1.2 µm
in size and 1.4 µm high with baseplate included; baseplate slightly to distinctly concave; conical
superstructure composed of an average of 12 scattered polygons tapering anteriorly to one or two
oblong peaks.
Somatic cilia about 10 µm long, arranged in an average of 13 bipolar, equidistant rows each
having 26 cilia on average; three rows anteriorly modified to dorsal brush (Fig. 31a, c, d, 32c,
Table 12). Brush rows 1 and 2 in rather deep furrows, on average of same length and structure, i.
e., composed of fairly widely spaced dikinetids with V-like spread bristles about 2 µm (anterior
bristle of dikinetids) and 4 µm (posterior bristle) long; bristles immobile and obliquely attached
to body surface, thus entirely covered by the mucilaginous layer and invisible in the scanning
electron microscope. Brush row 3 extends to mid-body, composed of monokinetids with about 3
µm long, cylindroidal, immobile bristles projecting from body proper at right angles and piercing
mucilaginous layer (Fig. 31c, 32c). All rows continue posteriorly as ordinary somatic ciliary rows.
Oral bulge distinctly set off from neck, about 4 µm wide and 3 µm high in vivo, in most specimens
conical, in a few cylindroidal or incus-shaped. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed
of dikinetids each with a 10 µm long cilium. Oral basket not impregnated (Fig. 31a, c, 32a–c).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, where it was moderately abundant
so that SEM investigations could be made. The minute extrusomes suggest a special diet.
Unfortunately, we could not identify the contents of the food vacuoles, possibly because the prey
is lysed outside.

Remarks: There are two other trachelophyllids with minute extrusomes: Bilamellophrya
etoschensis Foissner et al., 2002 from a slightly saline soil of the Etoscha National Park
in Namibia; and Trachelophyllum africanum Foissner et al., 2002 from soil of South Africa.
Bilamellophrya etoschensis differs from B. fraterculus by the type II scales (with concave arcs
vs. irregularly arranged polygons; Fig. 31e–g) and the extrusomes (4 µm long, fine rods vs. 1 µm
long cylinders).
Trachelophyllum africanum differs from B. fraterculus, of course, by the lepidosomes (one
vs. two types), while body and extrusome shape are rather similar (very narrowly cuneate and
3.5–4 µm long vs. cylindroid and 1 µm long). However, Foissner et al. (2002) described two
other populations of T. africanum, one from Namibia (Southwest Africa) and another from
Venezuela. These populations have extrusomes like B. fraterculus, except of the argyrophily
(deeply impregnating vs. not impregnating using the same method). Unfortunately, Foissner et
al. (2002) provided SEM micrographs only for the Venezuelan specimens, which differ distinctly
from B. fraterculus in having only type I scales (confirmed by inspection of the original SEM
micrographs).
Bilammelophrya hawaiiensis Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002 (Fig. 33a–f)
The specimens from Venezuelan site (56) match the Hawaiian type quite well. However, they are
slightly larger (~ 200 µm vs. 150 µm) and have slightly more polygons in the superstructure of
the type I scales (11 vs. 8). We add some scanning micrographs, especially from the hexagonally
faceted baseplate of the type II scales, which were rather poorly preserved in the Hawaiian
specimens (Fig. 33d, e).
Lingulotrichidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Oblong to narrowly obclavate, moderately to distinctly contractile Trachelophyllina
grain, 1994. Dorsal brush heteromorphic, composed of more than three rows. Two types of finely
honeycombed, two-dimensional lepidosomes. Type X elliptic with upright basering; type XI and
type XII tongue-shaped with concave baseplate and special structures anchoring lepidosomes to
pellicle.
Type genus: Lingulothrix nov. gen.
Remarks: The new family is well supported by the complex dorsal brush and the unique
lepidosomes. Whether or not the Lingulotrichidae belong to the → Trachelophyllina needs
molecular investigations. Possibly, it is a distinct group with a different ancestor because the
organization of the dorsal brush, the shape of the dikinetal brush bristles, the lepidosomes, and the
nuclear apparatus are markedly different. Possibly, the genera Enchelyotricha and Balantidion
(for SEM micrographs and descriptions, see Foissner 1987, Foissner et al. 1999, 2002) belong to
the Lingulotrichidae because their dorsal brush and nuclear apparatus is highly similar. However,
lepidosomes are absent.
105

The lepidosomes of the Lingulotrichidae lack the superstructure found in the → Trachelophyllidae,
i. e., they consist of the baseplate only and are thus two-dimensional (vs. three-dimensional).
The baseplates of the → Trachelophyllidae have a simple organization while those of the
Lingulotrichidae are rather complex anchoring the lepidosomes to the pellicle. We distinguish
two genera according to the shape of the anchor: Lingulothrix nov. gen. (anchor campanulate) and
Cataphractes nov. gen. (anchor gooseneck-shaped).
Lingulothrix nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Lingulotrichidae with type X and type XI lepidosomes. Type XI anchored to pellicle
with a short, campanulate elongation of the baseplate making lepidosomes sock-shaped in lateral
view.
Type species: Lingulothrix galapagensis nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun lingula (small tongue) and the Greek noun thrix (hair ~
ciliate), meaning a ciliate with tongue-shaped lepidosomes. Feminine gender.
Remarks: Enchelys-like and Enchelyodon-like haptorids with a slime cover were classified by
Kahl (1927) into the genus Lagynus quennerstedt, 1867. However, Lagynus elegans, type of
the genus, lacks such cover (reviewed in Foissner et. al. 1995 and aesCht 2001). In 1930a, he
classified slimy haptorids into the genus Enchelys. However, E. farcimen, type of the genus,
and its supposed junior synonym, E. gasterosteus Kahl, 1927, also lack a slime cover (Kahl
1930a, Foissner and Foissner 1988, Foissner et al. 1995). Based on the following description of
several slimy haptorids with tongue-shaped lepidosomes, we split Enchelys into Enchelys (dorsal
brush three-rowed, without lepidosomes), → Lingulothrix nov. gen. (dorsal brush complex,
lepidosomes sock-shaped), and → Cataphractes nov. gen. (dorsal brush complex, lepidosomes
gooseneck-shaped).
Lingulothrix galapagensis Foissner & steMPFhuber nov. spec. (Fig. 34a–v, 35a–n,
36a–r, 37a–k; Table 13)
Diagnosis: Size about 110 × 17 µm in vivo, moderately contractile; oblong to narrowly obclavate
and more or less curved. Macronucleus ellipsoid, micronucleus globular. Oral bulge indistinct,
discoid. Two types of basically rod-shaped extrusomes: type I slightly curved and about 23 µm
long; type II only 2–3 µm long. On average 14 ciliary rows, 5 contributing to dorsal brush: row
1 with about 9 dikinetids; rows 2 and 3 with 1–2 dikinetids anteriorly followed by an average of
15 and 4 monokinetal bristles, respectively; rows 4 and 5 composed of an average of 9 and 10
monokinetal bristles, respectively. Type X lepidosomes cuneate, on average 0.6 × 0.35 × 0.23 µm
in size and with 10 hexagons in baseplate. Type XI sock-shaped in lateral view, on average 1.2 ×
0.5 × 0.35 µm in size and with 36 hexagons in baseplate; anchor about 0.3 µm long and slightly
to distinctly campanulate.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
106

been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Type locality: Soil from the garden of the hotel San Fernando, Puerto Ayora, Galápagos Islands,
0°44’ S 90°18’ W.
Etymology: Named after the Galápagos Islands, where it was discovered.
Description: This species was difficult to impregnate with the ordinary protargol protocol.
However, when ethanol (70% vol.) was used as a fixative, clear impregnations were obtained.
Unfortunately, ethanol fixation usually causes strong shrinkage of the cells. According to the
live measurements, L. galapagensis has a size of about 110 × 17 µm; specimens in the SEM
have a size of 90 × 14 µm (Table 13); assuming a shrinkage of about 20%, as common in SEM
preparations, we obtain an average size quite similar to that from live. In contrast, the ethanol-
fixed cells measure only 70 × 14 µm, suggesting a length reduction by 37%. The length:width
ratio is also rather distinctly influenced by the preparation method: about 7:1 in vivo, 6.3:1 in SEM
Table 13. Morphometric data on Lingulothrix galapagensis based, if not mentioned otherwise, on

preparations, and 5.2:1 in ethanol-fixed and protargol-impregnated specimens (Fig. 34a–c, 35f,
l–n, 36a, b; Table 13). Contracted specimens distinctly stouter, i.e., with an average length:width
ratio of about 3:1 (Fig. 34f, 35b, c, d, 36c; Table 13).
Body oblong to narrowly obclavate, frequently slightly curved in anterior half; not flattened; in
protargol preparations usually buckled or sigmoidal (Fig. 34a–c, t, 35f, l–n, 36a, b). Contractile
by about one third of body length, becomes elongate ellipsoid, rarely indistinctly obclavate (Fig.
34f, 35b–d, 36c); contracts and extends slowly with movements resembling euglenid metaboly
(Fig. 35d). Nuclear apparatus in or near body centre (Fig. 34a, u, 35c, d, f, l–n; Table 13).
Macronucleus ellipsoid to distinctly reniform, on average 14 × 7 µm in protargol preparations;
nucleoli of ordinary size. Micronucleus attached to long side of macronucleus, usually globular,
rarely ellipsoid, about 2 µm across; possibly lacking in half of specimens. Contractile vacuole
in posterior end, a single excretory pore in pole centre (Fig. 34a, u, 35b, c, f, 36q). Two types
of extrusomes attached to oral bulge (Fig. 34a, d, g–i, 35b, d–j, 37a; Table 13): type I forms a
108

conspicuous bundle, rod-shaped to indistinctly acicular, slightly curved, about 20–25 × 0.5 µm
in vivo; many immature stages scattered in cytoplasm, these and the proximal, toxin-containing
portion of mature extrusomes usually lightly impregnate with the protargol method used. Type
II extrusomes oblong and 2–3 µm long in vivo; explode under slight coverslip pressure, do not
impregnate with protargol. Cytoplasm colourless, usually studded with food vacuoles 5–8 µm
across and few to many lipid droplets 0.5–10 µm in size (Fig. 34a, 35b, c, f). Swims and creeps
slowly on microscope slide. Food not known but likely small ciliates as indicated by large lipid
droplets.
Cortex flexible, contains rather dense rows of colourless granules 0.1–0.5 µm across (Fig.
34e, 37d); covered by a mucilaginous layer about 1 µm thick in vivo and 1.5 µm in protargol
preparations. Mucilaginous layer contains type X and type XI lepidosomes, the latter recognizable
in vivo as minute, anteriorly directed lines, and as blue cover in alcian blue preparations (Fig.
34m, 37a, b). Type X lepidosomes attached to pellicle; ovate, elliptic or broadly elliptic in surface
view while cuneate in lateral view (Fig. 34j–l, 36l–o, 37e; Table 13): on average 0.6 × 0.35 ×
0.23 µm in size and with 10 hexagons in baseplate and 10 quadrangular meshes in basering. Type
XI in one layer on type X lepidosomes, of complex structure, i. e., with a tongue-shaped main
part and a campanulate anchor attached to pellicle; best described as sock-shaped in lateral view
and as tongue-shaped in top and back view. Tongue-shaped part in lateral view straight, slightly
concave, or slightly sigmoid, narrowed end directed anteriorly, sock instep (baseplate) moderately

about 3 µm long in vivo; rows 4 and 5 composed of only monokinetal bristles. All rows continue
posteriorly as ordinary somatic kineties.
Oral bulge in vivo and in the SEM inconspicuous because only 2–3 µm high (Fig. 34a–c, g,
35b–f, 36a–c, k) while usually inflated to an average of 4 µm in ethanol-fixed cells (Fig. 35k–
n); discoid with slightly concave centre, assumes a characteristic shape under slight coverslip
pressure (Fig. 34d); rather refractive because containing type II extrusomes and anterior end
of type I extrusomes. Circumoral kinety circular, composed of dikinetids, anterior basal body
ciliated, posterior barren but with a pharyngeal rod contributing to the oral basket (Fig. 34a, d, g,

Cataphractes nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Lingulotrichidae with type X and gooseneck-shaped type XII lepidosomes anchored
to pellicle with a minute plate (goosehead).
Type species: Cataphractes austriacus nov. spec.
Etymology: The Latin noun cataphractes (scale = lepidsome maker) refers to the mucilaginous
cover containing minute scales. Masculine gender.
Remarks: See Remarks to family and to genus → Lingulothrix.
Cataphractes austriacus nov. spec. (Fig. 38a–x, 39a–l, 40a–t, 41a–g; Tables 14,
15)
Diagnosis (includes Kahl´s data): Size in vivo 120 × 20 µm, contractile by up to 50%. Very
narrowly oblong (~7:1), elongate ellipsoid when moderately contracted. Macronucleus ellipsoid,
micronucleus globular to ellipsoid. Oral bulge indistinct, discoid. Two types of extrusomes:
type I slightly acicular and more or less curved, 25–30 µm long; type II only 2–3 µm long. On
average 18 ciliary rows, 6 contributing to dorsal brush: row 1 composed of an average of 13
dikinetids; row 2 with three; rows 3–6 composed of monokinetids with up to 6 µm long bristles.
Type X lepidosomes broadly to slenderly elliptical or ovate, with an average of 11 polygons in
baseplate, 0.63 × 0.40 µm in size. Type XII lepidosomes gooseneck-shaped in lateral view, with
37 hexagons in baseplate and 4 polygons in anchorplate on average, about 1.23 × 0.55 × 0.94 µm
in the scanning electron microscope.
Type locality: Water and mud from Sphagnum cushions of a small bog in the surroundings of the
village of Überling, Salzburg country, 47°48’N 13°03’O.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description: Moderately variable, i. e., coefficient of variability (CV) > 15% in only five of 18
features measured; CV < 15% in all important characteristics, such as body length (9.6%), number
of ciliary rows (3.4%), and number of dikinetids in dorsal brush row 1 (13.1%). Most lepidosome
features with a CV > 15%, very likely partially caused by strong preparation shrinkage (Table
14).
Size in vivo 100–140 × 17–20 µm, on average 120 × 19 µm (Table 14); protargol-prepared
specimens match well when 15% preparation shrinkage is added. Body in vivo narrowly oblong
(length:width ratio 4.6) to cylindroidal (9.7), on average very narrowly oblong (7.3); frequently
curved, especially in anterior half; body ends narrowly rounded, rarely bluntly pointed; not
flattened laterally (Fig. 38a, b, d, e, u, 39a–c). Contractile up to 50% of body length, strongly
contracted cells elongate ellipsoid or more or less lageniform (Fig. 38c, w, 39d, f, i, 40b); contracts

in or near mid-body, may be strongly dislocated in overfed specimens (Fig. 38a, v, w, 39a–d, f,
g; Table 14). Macronucleus globular to elongate ellipsoid, on average ellipsoid; contains many
minute nucleoli. A single micronucleus attached to macronucleus in various positions, globular
to ellipsoid. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, with single excretory pore in or slightly
off pole centre (Fig. 38a, u, 39c). Two types of extrusomes attached to oral bulge (Fig. 38a, f,
i–k, 39g, j, k): type I forms a conspicuous bundle in oral body portion, slightly to rather distinctly
acicular, more or less curved, about 30 µm long in vivo, does not impregnate with the protargol
method used; type II oblong and minute, i. e., 1–2 µm long. Developing extrusomes frequent in
cytoplasm, rod-shaped and curved, certain stages impregnate with protargol (Fig. 38h, m, 39k).
Cytoplasm colourless, usually studded with 5–10 µm-sized lipid droplets and food vacuoles with
small flagellates and ciliates (Fig. 38a, 39f, g). Glides and swims slowly rotating about main body
axis.

µm in the SEM; 11 polygons in baseplate on average (Fig. 38o, 39l, 40f, h, i; Table 14). Type
XII in one layer on type X lepidosomes, of complex structure, i. e., with a tongue-shaped main
part and a gooseneck-shaped anchor attached to pellicle with a minute anchorplate (goosehead);
best described as swan-shaped in lateral view and as tongue-shaped in top and back view; on
average 1.23 × 0.55 × 0.94 µm in size and with 37 hexagons in concave baseplate and four in flat
anchorplate. Tongue-shaped part in lateral view straight, slightly concave, or slightly sigmoidal,
narrowed end directed anteriorly, tongue underside slightly concave; basering on surface and
composed of quadrangular meshes. Anchor belongs to baseplate, straight or slightly sigmoid,
anchorplate rectangularly curved and directed backwards, on average 0.32 × 0.27 µm in size (Fig.
38m, p–t, 39i, l, 40a, c–t; Table 14).
Cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, with spiral surface pattern (Fig. 40m), ordinarily to loosely spaced,
arranged in an average of 18 narrowly spaced (~3.5 µm), bipolar rows five or six modified to
dorsal brush anteriorly (Fig. 38a, u, v, x, 39a–e, i, 40a, b; Table 14). Dorsal brush heteromorphic,
very likely structured as shown in Figures 38v, x; row 1 composed of an average of 13 dikinetids
with anterior bristles in vivo slightly inflated, about 1 µm long, and thicker than posterior bristles
about 0.5 µm long, continues with monokinetal about 3 µm long bristles; row 2 composed of
an average of three dikinetids quite similar to those of row 1, continues posteriorly with about
3 µm long monokinetal bristles; rows 3 to 6 with monokinetal bristles, those of row 4 gradually
increasing in length from 2 µm anteriorly to 6 µm posteriorly.
128

Oral bulge in vivo and in SEM micrographs inconspicuous because only 2 to 3 µm high (Fig.
38a, f, 39f, i, 40b) while usually inflated to an average of 5 µm in ethanol-fixed cells (Fig. 38u,
v, 39a–d; Table 14); discoidal with slightly concave centre, covered by the mucilaginous layer,
rather refractive because containing type II extrusomes and anterior end of type I extrusomes.
Circumoral kinety circular (Fig. 39e), composed of 30 to 40 dikinetids, anterior basal body
ciliated, posterior barren but associated with a pharyngeal rod contributing to the tubular oral
basket (Fig. 38a, f, u, v, 39a–g, i).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. We could cultivate C. austriacus for
a week in the original sample enriched with a few wheat kernels, providing sufficient specimens
for a detailed investigation.
Remarks: Species of the genera Lingulothrix and Cataphractes are difficult to identify in vivo
because they have few features and body size and shape vary distinctly due to their contractility;
additionally, contraction and extension are very slow, and thus the real shape and size are difficult
to fix. For comparison with similar species, see → Lingulothrix galapagensis and Table 15. There
are haptorids from various genera which look similar to lingulotrichids, e. g., several Enchelys
and Enchelyodon species (Foissner 1984, Kahl 1930a) and Enchelyotricha spp. (Foissner et al.
2002). However, none has a mucilaginous cover, except of the → trachelophyllids, and are thus
easily separable from the lingulotrichids.
Kahl (1927) described Lagynus vestitus which he later transferred to Enchelys (Kahl 1930a).
Kahl´s Enchelys vestita is highly similar to Cataphractes austriacus: both have a thin, radially
striated mucilaginous layer, a single ellipsoid macronucleus, about 25 µm long toxicysts, a
similar body shape, and occur in boggy habitats of Central Europe. Only one feature does not
match well, viz., body length which is 200–220 µm according to Kahl (1930a) while only about
150 µm in Kahl (1927) due to a calibration error (Foissner & wenZel 2004). Another difference
concerns contractility which Kahl (1927) did not recognize (“ohne bemerkte Kontraktilität”)

while our specimens are distinctly contractile. Unfortunately, Enchelys vestita has never been
redescribed and lacks type material.
The considerable size difference (120 µm vs. 200 µm) argues against the use of the Austrian
population as a neotype for Enchelys vestita. Indeed, Martin KreutZ (pers. comm.) found a
species in a small Sphagnum pond in Germany (KreutZ & Foissner 2006) that looks quite similar
to C. austriacus (Fig. 41a–c, f) but has a size of about 200 × 35 µm (n = 26) when extended. An
identification with E. vestita is possible if one assumes that Kahl (1927) observed only contracted
specimens (Fig. 38l) and did not recognize the strongly reniform shape of the macronucleus (Fig.
38l, 41d). Our Brazilian freshwater species is also rather similar to E. vestita (Table 15) but
body shape is clearly different and the cells are not flattened laterally (vs. flattened on one side,
Kahl 1927). Obviously, much more research is needed before a neotypification can be made.
Cataphractes terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 42a–n, 43a–q; Tables 14, 15)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 120 × 20 µm, contractile by up to 50%. Cylindroid to lageniform,
elongate ellipsoid to ellipsoid when fully contracted. Macronucleus and micronucleus ellipsoid.
Oral bulge indistinct, discoid. Two types of extrusomes: type I rod-shaped and slightly curved,
about 18 µm long in vivo; type II only 1.5 µm long. On average 31 ciliary rows, 5 or 6 contributing
to dorsal brush: row 1 composed of an average of 8 dikinetids; row 2 of 2; rows 3–5(6) composed
of monokinetids with about 2 µm long bristles. Type X lepidosomes (ground scales) very likely
absent. Type XII lepidosomes gooseneck-shaped in lateral view, with 34 hexagons in baseplate
and about 5 polygons in anchorplate, about 1 × 0.5 µm in the scanning electron microscope.
Type locality: Highly fertile Mahadja soil from Venezuelan site (25), about 50 km north of Pto.
Ayacucho, 67°36’W 5°41’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin species-group name terricola (living in soil) refers to the habitat the
species was discovered.
Description: The protargol preparations are mediocre because the cortical granules impregnated
rather deeply. However, most main features are recognizable, e. g., the nuclear apparatus and the
number of ciliary rows.
Size in vivo up to 130 × 20 µm (Fig. 43a), usually shorter, i. e., near 100 µm because rarely
fully extended; in protargol preparations 66–98 × 12–18 µm, on average 83 × 15 µm when 15%
preparation shrinkage is added (Table 14); contractile by up to 50%, contracts and extends slowly
with movements resembling euglenoid metaboly. When extended or slightly contracted narrowly
oblong (~ 5–6:1) to cylindroid (≥ 9:1) or slenderly lageniform (Fig. 42a, d–f, i, j, 43a, b, d), when
moderately or strongly contracted elongate ellipsoid or ellipsoid (Fig. 43h). Nuclear apparatus in
or slightly anterior of mid-body (Fig. 42a, d–f, j, 43a, b, d, j). Macronucleus ellipsoid to slightly
reniform; contains many minute nucleoli. A single, ellipsoid micronucleus attached to long side

of macronucleus. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end (Fig. 42a, d–f, j, 43a, b, d). Two
types of extrusomes attached to oral bulge (Fig. 42a–c, 43b, c, g, j, k): type I forms a conspicuous
bundle in oral body portion, rod-shaped and slightly curved, about 18 × 0.5 µm in vivo; does not
impregnate with the protargol method used; type II oblong and minute, i. e., about 1.5 µm long.
Developing extrusomes frequent in cytoplasm, either as singles or in small bundles, certain stages
impregnate with protargol (Fig. 42a). Cytoplasm colourless, more or less studded with 0.5–10
µm-sized lipid droplets and some vacuoles with crystalline contents indicating ciliates as a main
food; very likely feeds also on 10–15 µm long bacterial rods. Glides slowly on microscope slide.
Cortex very flexible, contains narrowly spaced rows of granules about 0.3–0.8 × 0.2–0.6 µm in
size (Fig. 42m); covered by a mucilaginous layer about 1 µm thick and thus easily overlooked
in vivo and in protargol preparations. Mucilaginous layer composed of slime and type XII
lepidosomes recognizable in vivo as minute, oblique lines oriented anteriorly (Fig. 42n); type X
lepidosomes, i. e., groundplates very likely absent. Type XII lepidosomes not studied in detail
but sufficiently to be sure that they are very similar to those of → C. austriacus, i. e., gooseneck-
shaped with the morphometrics shown in Table 14 (Fig. 43f, h, i, k–q); distal third narrower than
in → C. austriacus (Fig. 42g, h) but a preparation artifact cannot be excluded.
Cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, with spiral surface pattern, ordinarily to loosely spaced, arranged
in an average of 13 ordinarily spaced, bipolar rows five or six modified to dorsal brush anteriorly
(Fig. 42a, i, k, l, 43e, g, k; Table 14). Dorsal brush very similar to that of → C. austriacus: row
1 composed of an average of 8 dikinetids with bristles as described in C. austriacus and shown
in the Figures cited above; row 2 with two to four dikinetids anteriorly and monokinetal bristles
posteriorly; rows 3–5(6) only with monokinetal bristles 2 µm long in vivo.
Oral bulge in vivo and in SEM micrographs inconspicuous because only about 2 µm high (Fig. 42a,
43b, d, h, k) while usually inflated to an average of 3 µm in protargol-prepared cells (Fig. 42i, j;
Table 14); discoidal, covered by the mucilaginous layer, rather refractive because containing type
II extrusomes and anterior end of type I extrusomes. Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly
spaced dikinetids, anterior basal body ciliated, posterior barren but associated with a pharyngeal
rod contributing to the tubular oral basket (Fig. 42a, i, j, 43k; Table 14).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at Venezuelan sites (23, 25), i.e., in nutrient-rich, wet
soils; likely, a different species occurs at sites (56, 57). In the non-flooded Petri dish culture, C.
terricola was first recognized 20 days after rewetting sample (25), indicating a k-selected life
strategy (Foissner 1987).
Remarks: Cataphractes terricola and → Lingulothrix galapagensis are so similar that they
cannot be separated in vivo or in protargol preparations (Table 15) while the lepidosomes are
definitely different (gooseneck-shaped vs. sock-shaped). → Cataphractes austriacus has a higher,
non-overlapping number of ciliary rows (18 vs. 13–14 on average) and longer type I extrusomes
(~ 30 vs. 20 µm) with a different shape (acicular vs. rod-shaped). In contrast, the lepidosomes are
rather similar (Tables 14, 15) although type X (ground lepidosomes) is very likely absent.

Enchelyodon gondwanensis nov. spec. (Fig. 44a–l, 45a–g; Table 16)
Diagnosis: Size about 200 × 30 µm in vivo; slightly clavate to almost vermiform. On average
56 ellipsoid, scattered macronuclear nodules and 14 micronuclei. Extrusomes curved-filiform,
about 17 µm long in vivo. Cortex thick, studded with ellipsoid, refractive granules. On average
21 ciliary rows, three anteriorly differentiated to a distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush occupying
18% of body length and having up to 6 µm long bristles; row 1 on average with 17 dikinetids, row
2 with 23, and row 3 with 11. Oral bulge discoid, about 7 µm width and up to 3 µm high.
Type locality: Soil from a horse pasture in the surroundings of the Selva Verde Lodge, Pto. Viejo,
Costa Rica, 84°6’W 10°45’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the Ur-continent Gondwana, supposing that it originated in this area.
Description: Size 160–280 × 20–60 µm in vivo, on average about 200 × 30 µm, as calculated
from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data shown in Table 16 adding 15%
preparation shrinkage. Length:width ratio 3–12:1, on average 6.4:1 (Table 16). Shape also
highly variable, partially depending on nutrition state, slightly clavate, very elongate ellipsoid,
or almost vermiform; not flattened (Fig. 44a, b, e–g, 45a, b; Table 16). Macronuclear nodules and
micronuclei scattered in central 3/5 of cell (Fig. 44a, b, e, j, 45a–d, g; Table 16). Macronuclear
nodules on average 7 × 3.4 µm in size, each containing one or two large and some granular
nucleoli; usually, some rather long, moniliform pieces, resulting from incomplete fragmentation
after cell division (Foissner et al. 2002). Micronuclei minute, i. e., 1.5–2 µm across in protargol
preparations. Contractile vacuole occupying posterior end, without canals extending anteriorly,
several excretory pores in pole centre; a rather large defecation vacuole with hyaline, flabby
material ahead of contractile vacuole in about one third of specimens (Fig. 44a, c, e, g, 45a).
Mature extrusomes attached to oral bulge, curved-filiform, 16–18 µm long in vivo, do not
impregnate with the protargol method used; some specimens with many developing extrusomes
in cytoplasm, acicular with a large subterminal blister, impregnate deeply with protargol (Fig.
44a, b, i). Cortex colourless and slightly furrowed by ciliary rows, conspicuous because 1–1.5 µm
thick and the distinct tela corticalis impregnating with protargol (Fig. 45c, g); contains countless
ellipsoid, highly refractive, about 1 µm long granules, forming oblique rows between kineties
(Fig. 44a, j, k, 45g). Cytoplasm colourless, in one third of specimens packed with some large
(6–10 µm) and many small (2–5 µm) globular food inclusions, possibly segregated vacuoles
from large ciliate prey; most specimens rather transparent, containing small lipid droplets 1–3 µm
across and some empty appearing vacuoles. Glides and swims slowly, slender specimens show
considerable flexibility when wriggling between soil particles.
Cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 21 ordinarily ciliated and ordinarily
spaced, meridional rows; slightly condensed in oral area while slightly dispersed in rear quarter
and in anterior portion of one or two kineties left of dorsal brush (Fig. 44a–d; Table 16). Interkinetal
distance slightly reduced between first kinety right and left and posterior of dorsal brush; rarely a

minute suture at left margin of dorsal brush, where one or two kineties can be slightly shortened
(Fig. 44d). Dorsal brush three-rowed, distinctly heterostichad because row 3 shorter by 2/3 than
row 2; differences less pronounced in number of dikinetids: 16, 23, 11; occupies an average of
18% of body length. Brush bristles similar in all rows: anterior bristle of dikinetids oblong and
shorter by about 1/3 than slightly clavate posterior bristle; length of bristles decreases from 5–6
µm anteriorly to 2 µm posteriorly (Fig. 44a, c, d, h, 45b–f; Table 16); row 3 with a monokinetal
tail extending to second body third with rather narrowly spaced, about 3 µm long bristles; anterior
brush tails absent.
Oral bulge discoid, occupies about half of anterior body end, but in vivo inconspicuous because
only up to 3 µm high; on average 7 µm across in protargol preparations; dorsally slightly higher
than ventrally, causing a slightly oblique anterior end; surface flat to slightly convex; contains
anterior end of extrusomes (Fig. 44a–d, g, l; 45g, h; Table 16). Circumoral kinety and oral basket
as typical for haptorids; basket obconical and about 50 µm long, hardly recognizable in vivo;
oralized somatic monokinetids absent (Fig. 44b–f, 45c, e, f; Table 16).

Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in Costa Rica (see type locality) and in Venezuela, where
it occurred at three sites in the Henri Pittier National Park, viz., in soil and bromeliad mud near
Rancho Grande and in soil of a gallery forest.
Remarks: In vivo, E. gondwanensis highly resembles the Arabian E. alqasabi Foissner et
al., 2008a because of many matching features, e. g., body size and shape, nuclear pattern, and
extrusome shape. However, E. gondwanensis has doubled the number of ciliary rows (x 21 vs.
11) and has a flat (vs. globular) oral bulge. Further, details of the dorsal brush are different, e. g.,
the total number of dikinetids (51 vs. 26) and the absence (vs. presence) of anterior brush tails.
Thus, we consider both as distinct species emphasizing, however, their similarity in all main
traits, suggesting a common ancestor. Another similar species is E. tratzi Foissner, 1987d, an
European member of the genus, which differs from E. gondwanensis mainly by the ordinary,
weakly granulated cortex, a feature we checked in the original notes. Further, E. tratzi has acicular
(vs. filiform) extrusomes, less macronuclear nodules (x 21 vs. 56), much shorter dorsal bristles

(up to 2 µm vs. 6 µm), and is contractile (vs. acontractile) by 1/3 of body length. Enchelyodon
kenyaensis and E. armatides, both described by Foissner et al. (2002), are at first glance
also very similar but have a single, tortuous macronuclear strand. The most slimy specimens
(Fig. 44e) resemble E. terrenus Foissner, 1984, which, however, has acicular (vs. filiform)
extrusomes and an average of 33 (vs. 21) ciliary rows and 150 (vs. 56) macronuclear nodules.
Enchelyodon longinucleatus Foissner, 1984 (Fig. 46h–k, 48d–i; Table 18)
The population studied is from soil at the margin of a mangrove swamp in the Dominican
Republic, about 10 km west of the town of Puerto Plata. The dark, slightly saline soil (5‰) had
pH 6.2. We investigated only the resting cysts, which are spherical with an average diameter
of 32.4 µm (SD = 3.2, CV = 9.9, Min = 28, Max = 38, n = 8). The cyst is colourless and has a
voluminous mucous coat (x = 60.6 µm, SD = 4.0, CV = 6.0, Min = 55, Max = 67, n = 8) densely
populated by about 4 µm-sized bacteria with bright, refractive inclusions (Fig. 46h–k, 48d, e,
g, h). The cyst wall is 1–2 µm thick, lacks any recognizable zonation (Fig. 48i), and is studded
with conical spines 1–3 µm high and about 2 µm wide at base (Fig. 46h, i, 48f). The cyst’s
plasm is very finely granulated and dense. The macronucleus is distinctly shortened (Fig. 48g).
Enchelyodon floridensis nov. spec. (Fig. 46a–g, 47a–f, 48a–c; Tables 17, 18)
Diagnosis: Size about 100 × 50 µm in vivo; usually ellipsoid. Macronucleus about as long as cell,
with 8 distinct nodules on average. Extrusomes rod-shaped, about 10 µm long in vivo. Cortex
thick, studded with ellipsoid, refractive granules. On average 47 ciliary rows, three anteriorly
differentiated to an isostichad dorsal brush occupying 46% of body length and having up to 3 µm
long bristles; row 1 on average with 43 dikinetids, row 2 with 45, and row 3 with 31. Oral bulge
circular to broadly elliptical, about 11 µm wide and up to 2 µm high. Cyst spines conical, about
8 × 3 µm in size.
Type locality: Soil from the Everglades in Florida, USA, Pine trail, 80°41’W 39°N.

Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country in which it was discovered.
Description: Only 18 specimens were found in the protargol slides; about half were well
impregnated. Thus, the morphometry of some characteristics is incomplete, and the brush
dikinetids were counted not only in total but also in 20 µm of each row.
Size 80–130 × 35–65 µm in vivo, on average about 100 × 50 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the data shown in Table 17 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Length:width
ratio 1.7–2.5:1, on average 2.1:1. Shape fairly constant, usually ellipsoidal, rarely slightly ovate
or bluntly pointed posteriorly; inconspicuously flattened in anterior third (Fig. 46a, c, d, 47a–c,
e, f). Macronucleus strongly and irregularly curved, about as long as cell, with an average of
eight distinct nodules and globular to irregular nucleoli (Fig. 46a, c, d, 47b, c, e, f; Table 17).
Micronuclei scattered throughout cell, 2–3 µm across, difficult to count because of similar cell
inclusions (Fig. 46a, c, 47b, c, e). Contractile vacuole in posterior end, with several excretory
pores in pole centre (Fig. 46a, c, d). Mature and developing extrusomes scattered in cytoplasm,
the latter sometimes deeply impregnated and with a central convexity (Fig. 46c); when mature
rod-shaped with rounded ends, in vivo about 10 × 0.4 µm in size, form a broad ring in oral
bulge (Fig. 46a, b, e, 48a); exploded in silver carbonate preparations, showing an about 5 µm
long, deeply impregnated, toxin-containing proximal region and a 20–30 µm long, weaker-
impregnated tube (Fig. 48b, c). In silver carbonate preparations, a second type of extrusomes
(?) becomes recognizable, viz., oblong structures (developing cortical granules?) 1–2 µm long.
Cortex colourless and slightly furrowed by ciliary rows, flexible but not contractile, conspicuous
because gelatinous and 1–1.5 µm thick, studded with ellipsoidal, highly refractive granules about

1 × 0.5 in size (Fig. 46f, 47c, e). Cytoplasm packed with compact and loose food vacuoles up to
20 µm across, few to many lipid droplets 1–5 µm in diameter, and up to 200 conical inclusions,
very likely cyst spines (Foissner 2011) with an average size of 8.5 × 3.3 µm (Fig. 46a, c, 47a;
Table 17); spines slightly concentrated in anterior third of body, some slightly curved, faintly
impregnated; developing spines smaller and heap-shaped (Fig. 46c, 47d–f; Table 17). Swims
slowly rotating about main body axis.
Cilia 8–10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 47 ordinarily spaced, meridional rows
abutting slightly obliquely on circumoral kinety; interkinetal distance gradually increases from
anterior to posterior, rear pole area sparsely ciliated. Three isostichad, dikinetal brush rows with
longest row 40 µm and thus occupying 46% of body length. Brush bristles up to 3 µm long in
vivo and very narrowly spaced, brush thus difficult to investigate (Fig. 46a, c, d, g, 47a; Table 17).
Oral bulge occupies central half of anterior body end, about 11 µm wide but very inconspicuous
because only 1 to 2 µm high, circular to broadly elliptical, according to the morphometric analysis
(Table 17). Circumoral kinety associated with about 25 µm long nematodesmata, forming a distinct
basket of which usually only the distal half is well impregnated; oralized somatic monokinetids
absent (Fig. 46a, c–e, g, 47a–c, f).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in soil from the Everglades of
Florida. Enchelyodon floridensis was rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture because only 18
specimens were found in eight protargol slides, and one third of these was precystic having cyst
spines in the cytoplasm. We cannot exclude that E. floridensis is a limnetic species because the
sample is from swamp land.
This small and inconspicuous sample contained two further conspicuous, undescribed species:
Apocolpodidium (Phagoon) macrostoma Foissner et al., 2002 and Apodileptus edaphicus VďaČný
and Foissner, 2012. As yet, these three species have been found only in this sample, indicating
that the region contains a high number of endemics.
Remarks: Many features of E. floridensis are between E. longinucleatus Foissner, 1984 and →
E. isostichos (Table 18). Possibly, the nodulated macronucleus is the most characteristic feature
of E. floridensis.
Enchelyodon isostichos nov. spec. (Fig. 49a–l, 50a–z; Tables 17, 18)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 × 75 µm in vivo; usually ellipsoid and more or less dumbbell-
shaped, broadest anteriorly or posteriorly. Macronucleus about two times as long as body.
Extrusomes rod-shaped, about 8 µm long in vivo. Cortex thick, studded with ellipsoid,
refractive granules. On average 72 ciliary rows, three anteriorly differentiated to an
isostichad dorsal brush occupying 41% of body length and having up to 3 µm long bristles;
row 1 on average with 51 dikinetids, row 2 with 61, and row 3 with 48. Oral bulge circular
to elliptic, about 16 µm width and up to 3 µm high. Cyst spines amphoriform, 7–10 µm long.

Type locality: Venezuelan site (1), i. e., soil from floodplain of the Orinoco River in the
surroundings of the village of Cabruta, 66°14’W 7°38’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Isosticha is a noun in apposition, composed of the Greek adjective iso (equal) and
the Greek noun stichos (row), referring to the dorsal brush whose rows have a very similar length.
Description: The preparations of E. isostichos are mediocre. Thus, the number of ciliary rows
and brush dikinetids could be counted in only nine specimens; the latter were counted also in 20
µm of each brush row (Table 17).
Size 130–210 × 60–100 µm in vivo, on average about 150 × 75 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the values shown in Table 17 adding 15% preparation shrinkage.
Length:width ratio 1.6–2.8:1, on average 2:1. Shape also highly variable, when starved cells
are included. Ordinary specimens ellipsoid to curved-ellipsoid with inconspicuous subapical
narrowing making cells slightly dumbbell-shaped. Starved specimens as shown in Fig. (49f, g),
i. e., rather distinctly dumbbell-shaped and broader anteriorly or posteriorly. Slightly flattened
only in anterior third (Fig. 49a, e–g, i, 50e, g–m, o; Table 17). Macronucleus and micronuclei
scattered throughout cell (Fig. 49a, e, 50e, g, h; Table 17). Macronucleus strongly and irregularly
curved, about twice as long as cell, ends slightly inflated; with dense, three-dimensional
nucleolar net; rarely broken into several pieces or bifurcate (Fig. 50h). Micronuclei 2–3 µm
across, difficult to count because of many similar-sized lipid droplets; some clear cells show the
following numbers: 16, 18, 20, 22, 23. Contractile vacuole occupies posterior end, during systole
surrounded by small adventive vacuoles, canals extending anteriorly absent; several excretory
pores in pole centre (Fig. 49a, e, f, 50h). Mature extrusomes scattered in cytoplasm and forming
a broad ring in oral bulge in vivo, rod-shaped with rounded ends, about 8–10 × 0.5 µm in size,
do not impregnate with the protargol method used; when exploded about 20 µm long and of
typical toxicyst structure (Fig. 49d, 50q–s); many deeply impregnated, fusiform, 6–8 µm long
developmental stages in cytoplasm. Cortex colourless and slightly furrowed by ciliary rows,
flexible but not contractile, conspicuous because gelatinous and 1–2 µm thick, studded with
ellipsoid, highly refractive granules, forming slightly oblique rows between kineties (Fig. 49j,
k, 50a–d, n), covered by an about 8 µm thick, structureless substance impregnating yellowish
in protargol preparations, possibly slime from extruded mucocysts (Fig. 49f). Most specimens
dark under low magnification (< 100 ×) and transmitted light because packed with lipid
droplets up to 7 µm across and developing or mature, amphoriform cyst wall precursors 7–10
µm long (Fig. 49l); most specimens contain one, rarely two zooids of Pseudotelotrochidium
epistylis (Fig. 49a, 50g). Swims moderately rapid rotating about main body axis.
Cilia 8–10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 72 densely ciliated and narrowly spaced,
meridional to very slightly oblique rows; not condensed in oral area, slightly dispersed in
posterior pole region (Fig. 49a, e, 50i–o; Table 17); do not form sutures along dorsal brush. Three
152

isostichad, dikinetal brush rows, each about 55 µm long and thus occupying roughly 40% of body
length, extend in rather deep furrows and end with minute tails comprising a few monokinetal
bristles up to 2 µm long. Brush bristles only 2–4 µm long and very narrowly spaced, making brush
difficult to investigate, even in the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 49a, e, h, 50i, m, o, p, t, u, v;
Table 17). Brush row 1 composed of an average of 51 dikinetids; anterior bristles rod-shaped and
shorter than posterior ones being flame-shaped and about 4 µm long in anterior half of row while
slightly clavate in posterior half. Brush row 2 composed of an average of 61 dikinetids, bristles
similar to those of row 1 but posterior bristles flame-shaped throughout. Row 3 composed of an
average of 48 dikinetids with rod-shaped bristles, anterior bristles about 2 µm long, posterior 3 µm.
Oral bulge discoid, occupies middle third to half of anterior body end, about 16 µm wide
but very inconspicuous because only up to 2 µm high, circular to broadly elliptical, slightly
furrowed by transverse microtubule ribbons originating from circumoral dikinetids and
extending into concave bulge centre. Circumoral kinety associated with about 60 µm long
nematodesmata, forming a conspicuous basket of which usually only the distal half is well
recognizable; oralized somatic monokinetids absent (Fig. 49a–c, e, f, 50v–z; Table 17).
Occurrence and ecology: We found this species also in a terra firma soil sample from
one of the many islands in the Amazon River near to the town of Manaus. Enchelyodon
isostichos possibly feeds only on peritrichs because no other food was contained in the about
50 cells investigated. It is a massive species, indicating that it could be a contaminant in the
soil sample, i. e., a freshwater species which excysted in the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Remarks: Few Enchelyodon species have been well described (Foissner 1984, Foissner et
al. 2002, senler and yildiZ 2003), which limits the possibility to compare our new species.
Enchelyodon isostichos is obviously rather closely related to an Austrian population of E.
longinucleatus Foissner, 1984, in that it is, as yet, the sole congener with an isostichad dorsal
brush; in all other well-studied species, brush row 3 is distinctly shorter than row 2. Most
features of E. isostichos are twice or thrice as large as in E. longinucleatus. There is no overlap
in important features, such as body length (x = 133 µm; 112–180 µm vs. 62 µm; 56–70 µm),
number of ciliary rows (x = 71; 63–87 vs. x = 37; 32–43), and width of oral opening (x = 16
µm; 10–20 µm vs. x = 6.6 µm; 6–7). The values for E. longinucleatus have been confirmed
in a population from Kenya, Africa, emphasizing the distinctness of E. isostichos. Further, E.
longinucleatus has an ordinary ciliate cortex while it is thick and studded with conspicuous
granules in E. isostichos. For distinguishing E. isostichos from → E. floridensis, see that species.
Enchelyodon isostichos shows two peculiarities. The body is covered by a yellowish-impregnating
substance, possibly slime from extruded mucocysts (cortical granules). The shape of the oral bulge
is rather variable (CV nearly 20%, Table 17), i. e., circular to broadly elliptic. We studied this very
carefully in vivo and in the scanning electron microscope because bulge shape is an important
feature that has been used also as a generic vehicle (Fig. 49b, c, 50w–z).

Enchelyodon megastoma Foissner, agatha and berger, 2002 (Table 19)
Remarks: We found this species in floodplain soil from Botswana, with features very similar
to those described by Foissner et al. (2002), especially the large body (~ 200 µm) and the two
extrusome size types. Thus, we improved the morphometry (Table 19) and deposited seven
voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens in the repository mentioned below.
Foissner et al. (2002) described the oral bulge of the Namibian specimens as circular, which
would be a rather distinct difference to the populations from Botswana and Venezuela described
below. A re-inspection of the original notes on E. megastoma showed that a circular oral bulge
is definitely mentioned in vivo and in two out of 10 prepared specimens. Further, a circular oral
bulge is usual in this genus, but this may be variable (→ E. isostichos). In spite of these data,
we doubt the observation of Foissner et al. (2002) because the preparations from the Botswanan
specimens of E. megastoma show that the oral bulge is circular to elliptic, i. e., one can recognize
a long and a short bulge axis in some specimens (Table 19).
Enchelyodon monoarmatus nov. spec.
Diagnosis (includes two subspecies): Size of cultivated specimens about 150 × 100 µm in vivo.
Body broadly ellipsoid to slightly dumbbell-shaped or obovate to pyriform. Macronucleus a
tortuous strand about twice as long as cell; many micronuclei. Extrusomes rod-shaped, in vivo
about 12 × 0.5 µm. Cortex ~ 1 µm or ~ 2 µm thick, studded with granules about 0.8 × 0.2 µm
or 1.5–2 µm in size. On average 86 or 115 ciliary rows, three anteriorly differentiated to an
isostichad dorsal brush occupying about half of body length and with bristles up to 5 µm long in
vivo; brush row 1 on average with 52 or 64 dikinetids, row 2 with 55 or 74, and row 3 with 48 or
60. Oral bulge elliptic to slightly pyriform or ovate to pyriform, on average 52 × 36 µm or 60 ×
40 µm in protargol preparations. Resting cysts spiny, wall about 1 µm or 4 µm thick.
Etymology: Monoarmatus is a Latin adjective composed of mono (single) and armatus (armed),
referring to the single type of extrusomes compared to E. megastoma Foissner et al., 2002 which
has two types.
Remarks: Enchelyodon monoarmatus is rather similar to E. megastoma from which it differs in
having only one (vs. two) type of toxicysts, in body size (~ 150 × 100 µm vs. ~ 200 × 120 µm),
and the number of ciliary rows (< 120 vs. > 120).
The neotropic and the paleotropic populations of E. monoarmatus differ considerably, suggesting
subspecies rank for both.
Enchelyodon monoarmatus monoarmatus nov. sspec. (Fig. 51a–p, 52a–z; Table
19)
Diagnosis: Size of cultivated specimens about 160 × 100 µm in vivo; broadly ellipsoid or slightly
dumbbell-shaped in broad side view. Cortex ~ 1 µm thick, studded with oblong granules about
0.8 × 0.2 µm in size. On average 86 ciliary rows; dorsal brush row 1 with 52 dikinetids, row 2

with 55, and row 3 with 48. Oral bulge on average 52 × 36 µm in protargol preparations, usually
broadly elliptic. Resting cyst wall about 1 µm thick.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (1), i. e., soil from the floodplain of the Orinoco River in the
surroundings of the village of Cabruta, 66°14’W 7°38’ N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Further, we
deposited 4 paratype slides with silver nitrate-impregnated specimens (Chatton-Lwoff method).
Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description: The live observations were based on specimens from a non-flooded Petri dish
culture, while morphometry and ciliary pattern were studied in cells from pure cultures set up in
Eau de Volvic with crashed wheat grains and some ml of the Petri dish culture. This caused strong
growth of Euplotes muscicola, the preferred food of Enchelyodon monoarmatus monoarmatus.

long, slightly clavate bristles (n–p). Anteriorly, the rows have a short, monokinetal tail of ordinary cilia (m, arrow). Posteriorly,
the bristles strongly decrease in length and row 3 shows a short, monokinetal bristle tail (n, o); then, the rows proceed with
ordinary cilia to posterior body end (p). B (1–3) – dorsal brush (rows), BT – monokinetal bristle tail, CK – circumoral kinety,

Fig. 52q–u. Enchelyodon monoarmatus monoarmatus, mature resting cysts from life under the bright field (q, r) and interference
contrast microscope (s–u). The cysts have a diameter of about 80 µm and an about 1.5 µm thick wall (t, arrowheads) studded
with 1–12 µm long spines; they are colourless but appear dark under low magnification due to the compact contents (q, r). When
mature, the cyst contents shrinks, producing a hyaline area between wall and specimen (r, t). The hyaline area appears as a bright
ring in the bright field microscope (q). The cyst contents is composed of the cell organelles and countless lipid droplets up to 5
µm across. Scale bars 10 µm (s) and 50 µm (q, r, t, u).

the line where the bulge opens, i. e., where the postciliary microtubule ribbons, which originate from the circumoral dikinetids,
plunge into the oral basket. w: Resting cyst, showing the macronucleus shortened by about 50% relative to the trophic specimen.
The cyst spines impregnate distinctly. x: In optical section, the long cyst spines are quadrangular (arrows). y, z: The spines, which
are up to 12 µm long and have a broad base (z), are sharp like needles and show distinct ribs and furrows recognizable also with
interference contrast (x). The surface of the cyst wall is covered by reticulate, likely slimy material (z, arrowhead). BU – oral
bulge, MA – macronucleus. Scale bars 5 µm (y, z), 20 µm (v, x), and 40 µm (w).

However, growth was slow and strongly decreased after some weeks. Likewise, protargol
impregnation was difficult due to the thick cortex and the cortical granulation. Of the many
preparations made with various fixatives and methods, only a handful good slides remained.
Thus, we made also Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate preparations, where cell shape and size as well
as, in some well-impregnated specimens, even kinety number could be counted.
Size 115–200 × 85–125 µm in vivo, on average about 160 × 100 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the values shown in Table 19 adding 5% preparation shrinkage in
the silver nitrate prepared specimens; protargol-impregnated cells smaller by ~ 15% due to the
weaker fixation. Length:width ratio 1.2–2.2:1, on average 1.6:1. Shape also highly variable and
partially depending on side viewed (Fig. 51a, h, i, l–o, 52a, b, e, f, l; Table 19): ellipsoid to broadly
ellipsoid and more or less flattened anteriorly when viewed dorsally or ventrally (dorsal brush in
or near midline of cell) while oblong, slightly ovate or dumbbell-shaped when viewed laterally
(dorsal brush at cell margin). Anterior body end transverse truncate, rarely more or less oblique,
posterior broadly rounded. Macronucleus in central three fifths of cell, strongly and irregularly
curved, about twice as long as cell, with many scattered nucleoli occasionally forming a three-
dimensional reticulum; rarely broken in two pieces. Micronuclei difficult to identify due to many
similar-sized and impregnated cell inclusions (Fig. 51a, b; Table 19). Contractile vacuole in
posterior end, during systole surrounded by small adventive vacuoles, canals extending anteriorly
absent. Several excretory pores in pole centre (Fig. 51a, 52k). Mature extrusomes scattered in
oral bulge, except of bulge centre, very numerous, rod-shaped with narrowed, rounded ends,
12–15 × 0.4 µm in vivo (Fig. 51a, p), do not impregnate with the protargol method used; many
developing, deeply impregnating fusiform extrusomes in cytoplasm (Fig. 52i, l, m). Cortex
colourless, very flexible, hardly furrowed by ciliary rows, 1–1.5 µm thick, contains countless
granules forming oblique rows between kineties; individual granules very fine, i. e., about 0.8–1
× 0.2 µm in size, impregnate more or less deeply with protargol (Fig. 51e, f). Specimens usually
dark under low magnification (< 100 ×) and transmitted light because packed with lipid droplets,
food residues and, sometimes, with a big food vacuole containing a Euplotes muscicola or, rarely,
a Vorticella sp. (Fig. 51a). Swims rather slowly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 86 loosely ciliated and narrowly to
ordinarily spaced, meridional rows distinctly condensed in oral region while scattered in posterior
pole area; abut to circumoral kinety in or in nearly right angles; some rows shortened anteriorly
and/or posteriorly; do not form sutures along dorsal brush (Fig. 51a–c, g, 52a, b, d, e–h, i, m; Table
19). Three isostichad, dikinetal brush rows, each about 55 µm long and thus occupying roughly
43% of body length; each row with some ordinary cilia anteriorly and a minute tail posteriorly,
especially row 3, composed of 1 µm long bristles; posterior of brush a small non-ciliated area
in some cells; specimens with broken or irregular brush rows very rare. Brush bristles only up
to 3 µm long in vivo, their length gradually decreasing to less than 1 µm posteriorly; oblong
to slightly clavate and very narrowly spaced, making brush difficult to investigate, even with
the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 51a–c, g, 52c, e, f, i, j, m–p; Table 19). Brush row 1
composed of an average of 52 dikinetids. Brush row 2 composed of an average of 55 dikinetids.
Brush row 3 composed of an average of 48 dikinetids, posterior bristle of dikinetids shortened by
about 50% (Fig. 52o; Table 19).

Oral bulge very large, i. e., on average 52 × 34 µm in protargol preparations, but inconspicuous
in lateral view because only 2–3 µm high (Table 19). Shape highly variable, according to the
SEM micrographs: usually broadly elliptical, rarely ovate, slightly pyriform, or almost circular
(Fig. 51c, d, 52a–h, v); slightly furrowed by transverse microtubule ribbons originating from
circumoral dikinetids and extending into the slightly concave bulge centre (Fig. 51c, 52v).
Circumoral kinety associated with about 50 µm long nematodesmata, forming a conspicuous,
obconical basket studded with extrusomes (Fig. 51a–d, h, 52g, i, m; Table 19).
Resting cyst (Fig. 51j, k, 52q–u, w–z): The cysts are spherical with an average diameter of 80.1
µm when the spines are included (M = 80, SD = 6, SE = 1.1, CV = 7.4, Min = 70, Max = 95, n =
27). The yellowish, spinose wall is – for this kind of ciliates – conspicuously thin, viz., 1–1.5 µm.
There are two size types of spines: the large type is 4–12 µm long, conical to elongate conical,
and has an up to 5 µm wide baseplate while the spine proper is quadrangular and shows two to
several flat ridges in optical section; the small type is up to 4 µm long, conical, and smooth.
The cyst contents is colourless and mainly composed of lipid droplets 0.5–5 µm across. The
tortuous macronucleus is shortened by about 50%. When cysts became older, the contents
separates from the wall (Fig. 51j, 52q, r, t).
Occurrence and ecology: This species occurred in the same sample as → E. isostichos, i. e., in
alluvial, clayic, rather acidic (pH 5.2) soil covered with a thin litter layer visibly bound together
by whitish fungal hyphae. The sample was taken under a few leguminose trees about 100 m off
the river bank. The body shape indicates that E. monoarmatus monoarmatus is not a soil ciliate
but a floodplain “contaminate”.
Remarks: See E. monoarmatus pyriformis for discussion.
Enchelyodon monoarmatus pyriformis nov. sspec. (Fig. 53a–y, 54a–i, 55a–v;
Table 19)
Diagnosis: Size of cultivated specimens about 140 × 100 µm; obovate or pyriform in broad side
view. Cortex 1.5–2 µm thick, studded with granules about 2 × 0.3 µm in size. On average 115
ciliary rows; dorsal brush row 1 with 64 dikinetids, row 2 with 74, and row 3 with 60. Oral bulge
on average 60 × 40 µm in protargol preparations, usually ovate or pyriform. Resting cyst wall
about 4 µm thick.
Type locality: Soil from the Chobe River, Kabolebole Peninsula, southern Africa, 17°50’ E 25°S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: pyriformis (pear-shaped) refers to body shape.
Description and Remarks: Instead of providing an ordinary description, as for E. monoarmatus
monoarmatus, we emphasize the differences of the two subspecies. Further, the rich illustration

should help in identification. There are three main and three minor differences between E.
monoarmatus monoarmatus and E. monoarmatus pyriformis.
(i) Although body shape is sometimes a weak character and frequently poorly preserved in
preparations of large species, the differences are too conspicuous to be neglected. Both subspecies
are flattened laterally, i. e., when the dorsal brush is in or near the midline of the cell. In this
orientation, both are ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal and have a transverse truncate anterior end
and a comparatively narrow oral basket (Fig. 53f, i, k, m, o, p, 54b, d, i, 55f). In broad side view,
when the dorsal brush is near or at cell margin, E. monoarmatus pyriformis is usually obovate or
distinctly pyriform and has a more or less oblique anterior end and a wide oral basket (Fig. 53a,
e, g, h, j, l, n, q, v, t, 54a, c, f, h, 55a) while E. monoarmatus monoarmatus is ovate to ellipsoid
and slightly dumbbell-shaped and has a roughly transverse truncate anterior end (Fig. 53a, b, h,
i, l–o, 54a, b, e, f). Thus, the length:width ratio is higher in monoarmatus than pyriformis (1.4:1
vs. 1.3:1; Table 19).
(ii) The cyst wall is about 4 µm thick in E. monoarmatus pyriformis (Fig. 55p, s) while only about
1 µm in E. monoarmatus monoarmatus (Fig. 54r, t). Although the thickness of the cyst wall may
depend on environmental factors (Foissner 2011), this does not apply to the two subspecies of
E. monoarmatus, both having been isolated from floodplain soil and cultivated with the same
method. Further, the spines are more ribbed in E. monoarmatus pyriformis than in E. monoarmatus
monoarmatus.
(iii) The median of the number of ciliary rows is 115 in E. monoarmatus pyriformis while 85 in
E. monoarmatus monoarmatus, corresponding to a difference of 35%. Although there is some
overlap, the averages argue for separation of the populations (Table 19).
(iv) The oral bulge is usually more or less pyriform, rarely elliptic, obovate or roughly circular in
E. monoarmatus pyriformis (Fig. 53d, u, 54i, 55a, k–n) while usually elliptic, rarely indistinctly
pyriform, ovate, or roughly circular in E. monoarmatus monoarmatus.
(v) The cortex is 1.5–2 µm thick and studded with granules about 2 × 0.3 µm in size in E.
monoarmatus pyriformis (Fig. 53r, s, 55d) while about 1 µm thick and studded with granules
about 0.8 × 0.2 µm in size in E. monoarmatus monoarmatus (Fig. 53e, f).
(vi) The barren post-brush area is distinctly larger in E. monoarmatus pyriformis (Fig. 54i, 55f, i,
j) than in E. monoarmatus monoarmatus (Fig. 54e, j, n, p)
Enchelyodon armatides Foissner, agatha and berger, 2002 (Fig. 56a–j)
Material: Dominican Republic, site 21 (soil from margin of a mangrove swamp).
Supplementary observations: The Dominican specimens match well the three populations
investigated by Foissner et al. (2002). For instance, they have acicular extrusomes and 13–18
ciliary rows (x 15.7, M 15.5, SD 1.4, CV 9.0). Here, we supplement the description with scanning
electron micrographs, showing some other important features, such as the shape of the oral bulge
and details of the dorsal brush.

Fig. 56g–j. Enchelyodon armatides, anterior region in the scanning electron microscope. Overviews for Fig. (i) and (j), see Fig.
(f) and (d) on plate before, respectively. The shape of the oral bulge varies from discoid (g) to hemispheric (j). The bulge is
surrounded by narrowly spaced cilia, forming the circumoral kinety (g, i). The cilia, which are not elongated, originate from the
dikinetal circumoral kinety whose kinetids have ciliated only one basal body. The dorsal brush consists of three rows with up to
5 µm long bristles (h–j). Row 3 is composed of a short dikinetal portion anteriorly and a long monokinetal tail of minute bristles
(i, j and a, b, f of previous plate). B (1–3) – dorsal brush (rows), BT – monokinetal tail of brush row 3, BU – oral bulge, CK –
circumoral kinety. Scale bars 5 µm.

Fig. 57j–l. Enchelyodon lagenula, Venezuelan specimens in the scanning electron microscope. j, k: Dorsal and
ventral view of oral body portion. The circumoral kinety, which consists of dikinetids (blatterer and Foissner
1988), has ciliated only one basal body of each pair. The dorsal brush consists of three rows of paired bristles; row
3, additionally, has a moderately long posterior tail of monokinetal bristles. Note the massive, hemispheric oral
bulge and exploding cortical granules. l: A specimen with slightly conic oral bulge. B1–3 – dorsal brush rows, BT
– posterior tail of dorsal brush row 3, BU – oral bulge, CI – ordinary somatic cilium, CK – circumoral kinety, G –
exploding cortical granules. Scale bars 5 µm (k, l) and 10 µm (j).
178

The shape of the oral bulge varies from discoid (g) to hemispheric (j). The general structure
of the dorsal brush matches the description by Foissner et al. (2002): rows 1 and 2 have
a very similar length while the dikinetal portion of row 3 is distinctly shorter. We could not
see clearly the bristles of row 1; likely, they are similar to those of row 2 but slightly longer
(Fig. 56d, i, j). The middle portion of row 2 is composed of dikinetids with the anterior
bristles shorter by about 40% than the about 4 µm long, slightly clavate posterior bristles; at
the anterior and posterior end of the row, both bristles are about 2 µm long and oblong (Fig.
56d, f, i, j). Brush row 3 consists of a short dikinetal portion anteriorly, followed by an about
40 µm long tail of monokinetal, about 1 µm long bristles (Fig. 56a, b, d, f, j); the posterior
bristle of the dikinetids is slightly shorter than the 3–4 µm long anterior bristle (Fig. 56d, f, i, j).
Occurrence and ecology: Enchelyodon armatides occurs not only in the neotropics but also
globally. It has been reported from Australia, Namibia, and Tenerife (Foissner et al. 2002) as well
as from Austria (Foissner et al. 2005) and Saudi Arabia (Foissner et al. 2008). The habitats range
from sand dunes to mangrove soil, suggesting that it is an euryoecious cosmopolite.
Enchelyodon lagenula (Kahl, 1930) blatterer and Foissner, 1988 (Fig. 57a–l)
Supplementary observations: The specimens from soil of the floodplain of the Pedro River in
Jamaica and from soil of Venezuelan site (20) match very well the original description and the
redescription by blatterer and Foissner (1988). Thus, only some micrographs are provided,
showing important features of the species, such as the hemispheric (Fig. 57b, e, g, j, k) to conical
(Fig. 57l) oral bulge, the paired macronuclear nodules (Fig. 57b), the dense and conspicuous
cortical granulation (Fig. 57a, c, d), and the three-rowed dorsal brush having inconspicuous
bristles (Fig. 57h–j).
Occurrence and ecology: E. lagenula occurs in various terrestrial habitats globally, i. e., is an
euryoecious cosmopolite (Foissner 1998) which is, however, rather infrequent and possibly
absent from large regions, e. g., Namibia (Foissner et al. 2002).
Coriplites tumidus nov. spec. (Fig. 58a–p, 59a–m; Table 20)
Diagnosis (based on three populations): Size about 110 × 20 µm in vivo. Body narrowly obclavate
or elongate lenticular and with conspicuous, bulbous anterior end; posterior end narrowly
rounded. 2 ellipsoid macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus in between. On average 9–11
ciliary rows, three anteriorly differentiated to a heterostichad dorsal brush occupying 20–27%
of body length; brush row 3 shorter than row 2 by about 60% and composed of an average of 6
dikinetids. Oral bulge discoid to hemispheric, comparatively conspicuous because in vivo 4–6
µm high and slightly wider than neck.
Type locality: Needle litter and red surface soil (pH 6) from a small mountain in the outskirts of
the town of Alice Springs, Australia, 133°E 24°S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Further, 4

by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective tumidus (swollen) refers to the bulbous oral bulge.
Description: We investigated three populations, whose morphology and morphometrics match
so well that conspecificity is beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, we merge all data, except when
deviating more than usual.

Size in vivo 80–130 × 15–35 µm, usually about 110 × 20 µm, as calculated from some live
measurements and the values in Table 20 adding 15% preparation shrinkage; Australian cells
distinctly broader than those from Brazil and North America while body length is highly
similar; up to 30% contractile, especially neck. Length:width ratio 4.8–7.4 on average, body
thus narrowly to very narrowly obclavate or elongate lenticular and with conspicuous, bulbous
anterior end (= oral bulge) and narrowly rounded or acute posterior end (Fig. 58a, e, i, o, p,
59c, f, g; Table 20); slightly flattened laterally; usually slightly curved, rarely serpentine (Fig.
58c). Nuclear apparatus in various positions (CV 15–20%), on average slightly posterior to mid-
body; invariably composed of two macronuclear nodules and a single micronucleus in between;
macronuclear nodules irregularly arranged, nuclear figure thus highly variable (Fig. 58a, c, e, 59c,
f, g; Table 20). Nodules globular to very narrowly ellipsoid, usually ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid,
rarely reniform or C-shaped with micronucleus in C-centre; not separated into pairs in two out of
184

about 50 Australian specimens; about 10 × 6 µm in vivo and in protargol preparations; with large
central nucleolus and several small nucleoli in about 1/3 of specimens (Fig. 59d, e), others with
medium-sized and minute nucleoli. Micronucleus usually in between macronuclear nodules, very
rarely in vortex of nodules or attached laterally to a nodule; shape highly variable, viz., globular,
ellipsoid or broadly ellipsoid, rarely reniform (Fig. 58a, e, 59c–g; Table 20); frequently not or
only lightly impregnated with protargol. Some post-conjugants with typical nuclear pattern, i. e.,
four globular macronuclear nodules, present in each population (Fig. 59i). Contractile vacuole in
posterior body end with several subterminal excretory pores (Fig. 58a, f, 59m). Cytopyge next
to contractile vacuole, fecal mass loose. Cortex colourless and flexible, conspicuously thick due
to innumerable, ellipsoid extrusomes (mucocysts) about 1–1.3 × 0.5 µm in size. Extrusomes
strongly refractive thus appearing as minute, bright dots in surface view, form about eight rows
between adjacent kineties, present also in oral bulge cortex; bluntly fusiform and about 10 µm
long when exploded, swell to a 3–6 µm thick coat impregnating yellowish in some specimens
(Fig. 58a, d, e, l, 59a, b, d). Cytoplasm colourless, neck hyaline, trunk more or less turbid by lipid
droplets 1–7 µm across and food vacuoles 5–10 µm in diameter (Fig. 58a, b, 59b, e). Likely feeds
on flagellates and ciliates, Brazilian specimens ingest whole Sathrophilus muscorum possibly
contracting neck during food uptake (Fig. 58b). Glides and swims slowly.
Somatic cilia 8–10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 9–11 meridional, ordinarily to
narrowly (USA) spaced rows each composed of about 30 ordinarily spaced cilia on average;
cilia slightly wider spaced in neck and rear region, frequently absent posterior of circumoral
kinety (Fig. 58a, e, f, 59c, f–h; Table 20). Dorsal brush three- rowed and isomorphic, on average
occupies 20–27% of body length; heterostichad in Australian and Brazilian specimens, distinctly
heterostichad in USA population; each row with a minute anterior tail composed of a single (very
rarely two) monokinetid (Fig. 58a, e, g, 59c, f–h; Table 20). Brush dikinetids frequently oriented
slightly obliquely to main kinety axis, widely spaced except of ordinarily spaced kinetids in row
2 of North American specimens. Brush row 1 composed of an average of 19 dikinetids, slightly
shorter than row 2 composed of 22 dikinetids on average; row 3 shorter than row 2 by about 60%,
composed of an average of six dikinetids followed by a tail composed of about 10 monokinetal
bristles 1–2.5 µm long. Bristles not studied in detail, slightly clavate and up to 3 µm long in vivo
while up to 5 µm in protargol preparations (Fig. 58a, 59j, l; Table 20).
Oral bulge without toxicysts, as typical for genus, checked in about 10 populations; contains pale
mitochondria 2–4 × 1–3 µm in size; slightly to distinctly obliquely arranged to main body axis
and slightly higher dorsally than ventrally; in frontal view broadly elliptic and with small central
concavity; shape and size highly variable, discoid to hemispheric, usually conspicuous in vivo
and in protargol preparations because about 7 × 5 µm in size and thus slightly wider than neck
(Fig. 58a, c, e, g–p, 59c, f–h, j–l; Table 20). Circumoral kinety broadly elliptic, ∞- shaped due to
oblique position on neck, composed of narrowly spaced, oblique dikinetids (Fig. 58a, e–h, 59g,
h). Oral basket hardly recognizable in vivo and rarely distinctly impregnated with protargol,
about 20–30 µm long (Fig. 58f, 59k); oralized somatic monokinetids invisible, even in darkly
impregnated cells.
Occurrence and ecology: Coriplites tumidus is rather common in Australia, where it has been
found at several sites. It is also widespread in South America, where it occurs in Brazil, at
Venezuelan site (14), and at site (2) of the Isla Robinson Crusoe. In North America, C. tumidus
185

has been found in Idahoe, that is, in the outskirts of the town of St. Anthony, where it was
moderately abundant in a moos and litter collection (pH 6.8) from a sandy bushland. In Africa,
we found C. tumidus in red soil from the Agricultural Research Station of the Benin University
(coll. Jean Dragesco) and in surface soil (pH 6.1) from the Koël Bay, Cape Peninsula, Republic
of South Africa. As yet, we do not have a record from Europe. Most of the sites are sandy, which
matches the slender shape of the organism. In the non-flooded Petri dish cultures, the abundance
of C. tumidus is low to moderate.
Remarks: Coriplites tumidus has a highly characteristic nuclear pattern: two macronuclear nodules
and a micronucleus in between. However, the same pattern is found in two congeners (oertel et
al. 2008) and in at least six further haptorid genera (blatterer & Foissner 1988, Foissner et al.
2002, Foissner & Xu 2007): Apocoriplites lajacola, Apoenchelys bamforthi, Arcuospathidium
vermiforme, Cultellothrix spp., Enchelys binucleata, → E. lagenula, and Epitholiolus chilensis.
Thus, this feature is an identification mean only in context with a conspicuous oral bulge lacking
toxicysts.
Instead of a circumstantial comparison of C. tumidus with its congeners, we update the key
provided by oertel et al. (2008), showing that C. tumidus differs mainly by the large oral bulge
and the organization of the dorsal brush from its supposed nearest relative, C. terricola. The
last feature has been studied in two C. terricola and three C. tumidus populations, respectively,
showing a remarkable stability.

Family Spathidiidae
Mamillospatha nov. gen.
Diagnosis:Spathidiida Foissner & Foissner, 1988 with protospathidid ciliary pattern and nipple-
shaped lepidosomes on resting cyst surface.
186

Type species: Mamillospatha lepidosomatum (Foissner et al., 2014c) nov. comb. (basionym:
Protospathidium lepidosomatum Foissner et al., 2014c). Monotypic!
Etymology: Composite of the Latin nouns mamilla (nipple) and spatha (spatula) connected by
the thematic vowel -o, referring to the nipple-shaped lepidosomes of the resting cyst surface.
Feminine gender.
Remarks: This and the following genus are based on the study by Foissner et al. (2014c), i. e.,
on the resting cysts that have highly characteristic lepidosomes with shapes quite different from
those of the → Trachelophyllina, another group of haptorids. Further, this step takes into account
the molecular data that show many not yet named evolutionary traits within the Spathidiida and
Haptorida in general (VďaČný et al. 2014c).
Columnospatha nov. gen.
Diagnosis:Spathidiida Foissner & Foissner, 1988 with arcuospathidid ciliary pattern and pillar-
shaped lepidosomes on resting cyst surface.
Type species: Columnospatha bromelicola (Foissner et al., 2014) nov. comb. (basionym:
Arcuospathidium bromelicola Foissner et al., 2014). Monotypic!
Etymology: Composite of the Latin nouns columna (pillar) and spatha (spatula) connected by
the thematic vowel -o, referring to the pillar-shaped lepidosomes of the resting cyst surface.
Feminine gender.
Remarks: See → Mamillospatha
Facetospatha nov. gen.
Diagnosis:Spathidiida Foissner & Foissner, 1988 with arcuospathidid ciliary pattern and thick,
faceted cyst wall.
Type species: Facetospatha cultriforme (Penard, 1922) nov. comb. (basionyms: Spathidium
cultriforme Penard, 1922 and Arcuospathidium cultriforme (Penard, 1922) Foissner, 1984.
Etymology: Composite of the French noun facette (facet) and the Latin noun spatha (spatula)
connected by the thematic vowel -o, referring to the faceted wall of the resting cyst.
Remarks: The faceted resting cyst has been described by Foissner & Xu (2007). The genus
is supported by the molecular data where F. cultriforme forms a separate clade with moderate
statistical support (BI = 0.97, ML = 60, MP –) together with three Spathidium species and
Teuthophrys trisulca (VďaČný et al. 2014).

differentiated to an inconspicuous, heterostichad dorsal brush occupying 13% of body length and
comprising up to 4 µm long bristles: brush row 1 composed of an average of 9 dikinetids, row
2 of 14, and row 3 of 9 dikinetids followed by a short monokinetal bristle tail. Right side oral
kinetofragments composed of about 6 dikinetids each.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (66), i. e., highly saline soil from the north coast, Morrocoy
National Park, surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, 67°13’W 11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The specific name is a noun in plural genetive and thus does not change the gender
when combined with, e. g., a masculine genus; it refers to the habitat, i. e., growing or living in
saline environment.
192

Description: This species was discovered in a highly saline (~50–70‰) soil sample, and thus it did
not fix well. Further, the sample was fixed after a mass conjugation, and thus the slides contain many
post-conjugates with four globular macronuclear nodules, as typical for haptorids (Foissner and Xu
2007). These and poorly preserved specimens were excluded; however, we cannot entirely exclude that
some very late post-conjugates with an “ordinary“ macronucleus were included in the morphometric
analysis. The SEM micrographs are from cultivated specimens which differ from the non-flooded
Petri dish cells in having frequently a disordered brush and a less dense ciliation (Fig. 61g, h).
Size in vivo 110–210 × 15–25 µm, on average about 150 × 20 µm, as calculated from live and the
morphometric data in Table 21 adding 15% preparation shrinkage; length:width ratio on average
6:1 (3.3–11:1, n = 16) in vivo, 8:1 in protargol preparations (Table 21), and 6.8:1 (3.4–8.9:1, n
= 22) in SEM micrographs. Body usually very narrowly spathulate or very elongate lenticular,
rarely rod-like or very elongate obclavate, straight to distinctly curved; slightly flattened laterally
in oral region (Fig. 60a–c, 61a, d–i; Table 21). Nuclear apparatus in central quarters of cell
and rather poorly preserved in the protargol preparations (Fig. 60a, b, c, e, 61e, n, s; Table 21).
Macronucleus a tortuous more or less nodulated strand in 30 out of 40 specimens analysed and in
late early dividers (Fig. 61s); moniliform in six cells (Fig. 61e), and rod-like in four specimens;
frequently partially or completely spiralized with ends curved proximally; nucleoli indistinct.
Micronuclei not or poorly recognizable in two thirds of protargol-impregnated cells, frequently
difficult to distinguish from similar-sized, developing extrusomes and, possibly, from cyst wall
precursors; remarkable because of the lenticular shape (on average 2.6 × 1 µm) and the special
location: usually one each at or near ends of macronuclear strand; when three or four micronuclei,
some scattered along macronucleus (Fig. 60a, c, 61n; Table 21). Contractile vacuole in posterior
body end, with several pores in pole area. Mature extrusomes scattered around centre of oral
bulge, rod-shaped, 4–5 × about 0.5 µm in vivo, do not impregnate with the protargol method
used (Fig. 60a, d, g, 61c, k); many developing extrusomes and other lenticular or conical, deeply
impregnated structures (cyst wall precursors?) scattered throughout cytoplasm (Fig. 61f, n, p, s,
u). Cortex very flexible, colourless, slightly furrowed by ciliary rows and postciliary microtubule
ribbons, studded with minute (~ 0.2 µm) granules forming about eight rows between two kineties
each (Fig. 60i, j, 61h, v). Cytoplasm densely granulated, contains few to many moderately
refractive, 2–5 µm-sized (lipid?) inclusions and some up to 10 µm-sized food vacuoles with rather
compact contents, likely flagellates. Burrows between soil particles but swims also rather rapidly.
Cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 13 equidistant, ordinarily spaced and
ciliated rows modified to short, slightly oblique kinetofragments producing dense ciliation at
base of oral bulge; right side kinetofragments composed of three to nine dikinetids (Fig. 60a–c,
61g–i, m, o; Table 21). Dorsal brush three-rowed, heterostichad, isomorphic, and composed of
ordinarily spaced dikinetids, except of anterior tails each comprising about four very narrowly
spaced monokinetids; inconspicuous because occupying only 13% of body length and bristles
merely up to 4 µm long in second quarter of rows (Fig. 60a, c, h, k, 61a, f, i, j, l, p; Table 21).
Brush row 1 shortest, composed of an average of nine dikinetids having up to 3 µm and 1 µm
long posterior and anterior bristles, respectively. Brush row 2 longest, composed of an average
of 14 dikinetids with posterior and anterior bristles up to 4 µm and 3 µm long, respectively.
Brush row 3 shorter than row 2, composed of an average of nine dikinetids with bristles
similar to those of row 2; posterior tail composed of 2 to 20 monokinetal bristles 2–3 µm long.

Oral bulge flat and slightly higher on dorsal than ventral side of cell, obliquely truncate
by 30° to 60° (x = 40°), obovate in ventral view, centre slightly concave (Fig. 60a–c, e, g,
k, 61a–h, k, m–p; Table 21); inconspicuous because about half as width as broadest trunk
region and only 3–5 µm high. Oral basket rods well recognizable only in over-impregnated
specimens, originate from circumoral kinetofragments and extend about 20 µm into the cell.
Ontogenesis: Some key stages were found in the protargol preparations, showing (i) a slight
indentation in mid-body in late early dividers when the oral kinetofragments are assembled (Fig.
60e, f, 61s, t), (ii) a distinct widening in mid-body of early mid-dividers, and (iii) a still incomplete
opisthe oral bulge when the sisters separate (Fig. 60l, m, 61q, r). See Foissner and Xu (2007) and
Foissner et al. (2014b) for a comparison with other spathidiids.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., a highly saline (50–70‰)
coastal soil from Venezuela. Protospathidium salinarum could be cultivated for a short time by
adding some squashed wheat grains to the soil eluate.
Remarks: All genera and species mentioned in the following comparisons are
reviewed in the monograph of Foissner and Xu (2007). The population investigated belongs to
Protospathidium because, in contrast to Edaphospathula, the extrusomes are longer (≥ 4 µm
vs. ≤ 4 µm) and rod-shaped (vs. ovate and massive), and the right side oral kinetofragments are
composed of ≥ three dikinetids (vs. ≤ 3).
Protospathidium salinarum resembles P. namibicola, P. vermiforme, P. serpens, and P. fraterculum.
It differs from P. namibicola by body size (150 × 20 µm vs. 210 × 20 µm), the number and shape
of the micronuclei (up to 4, lenticular vs. many and ellipsoidal), and the number of ciliary rows
(on average 13 vs. only 9 although being considerably larger). Protospathidium salinarum differs
from P. vermiforme, an incompletely described species from the Austrian Central Alps, by body
size (150 × 20 µm vs. 120 × 10 µm) and the number of dikinetids in dorsal brush row 1 (8 vs. 3).
Protospathidium serpens and P. fraterculum differ from P. salinarum by body size (90 × 15 vs.
150 × 20), the shape of the micronuclei (globular vs. lenticular), and the number of dikinetids
in brush row 1 (3 vs. 8). Some Edaphospathula species also resemble P. salinarum but differ by
the features mentioned above. Do not confuse P. salinarum with Arcuospathidium namibiense,
which has a similar size and shape but possesses about 20 macronuclear nodules; minute, ovate
extrusomes; and some 15–20 µm long dorsal bristles.
Most Protospathidium and Edaphospathula species have been not recorded from saline habitats,
except of P. serpens and E. minor (Foissner and Xu 2007). Thus, the halophily of P. salinarum
can be considered as a further species character.
Spathidium stetteri Foissner & Xu nov. spec. (Fig. 62a–o, 63a–o; Table 22)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 210 × 30 µm. Very narrowly spatulate with oblique to strongly
oblique, cuneate oral bulge about 80% as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus long and
tortuous; multimicronucleate. Oral extrusomes in vivo rod-shaped and slightly curved, about
6 × 0.3 µm in size. One size type of cortical granules. On average 17 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly
modified to an isostichad dorsal brush with longest row 2 occupying about 20% of body length;

Germany, who collected the Galápagos samples.
Description: Size in vivo 170–260 × 25–40 µm, usually about 210 × 30 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 22 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage; length:width ratio also highly variable, viz., 4.7–9.2:1, on average near 7:1 both in vivo

and in protargol preparations. Shape narrowly spatulate to almost cylindroid, neck moderately
distinct, slender specimens can curve anterior body region (Fig. 62f, j); anterior end distinctly
oblique, posterior rounded, widest in or slightly posterior of mid-body (Fig. 62a, f–h, j, 63a, c;
Table 22). Macronucleus in central quarters of body, a long and highly tortuous, slightly flattened
strand frequently coiled and/or with slightly inflated ends; rarely more or less moniliform or in
two pieces (observed in only two out of 40 specimens); studded with nucleoli up to 7 µm across.
On average six globular micronuclei near and attached to macronuclear strand (Fig. 62a, j; Table
22). Contractile vacuole and some excretory pores in rear end (Fig. 62a, j). Mature extrusomes
studded in oral bulge, rod-shaped and slightly curved, in vivo 6–7 × 0.3–0.4 µm in size (Fig.
62a–c, 63f, k, l, o); do not impregnate with the protargol method used while some fusiform
cytoplasmic developmental stages impregnate deeply. Cortex flexible; cortical granules difficult
to recognize because only ~ 0.2 µm across and colourless, form about six rows between each two
kineties (Fig. 62d). Cytoplasm colourless, contains numerous lipid droplets up to 7 µm across and
some food vacuoles mainly in posterior body half, usually hyaline in anterior quarter (Fig. 62a).
Food not known. Swims and creeps rather rapidly.
Somatic cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 17 ordinarily spaced, mostly

bipolar and ordinarily ciliated rows abutting on circumoral kinety in typical Spathidium pattern;
anterior end of kineties densely ciliated; occasionally some irregularities, such as minute breaks
and/or short, supernumerary rows (Fig. 62a, j, l–o, 63a, c; Table 22). Dorsal brush slightly
dorsolateral, isostichad, dikinetal and three-rowed, inconspicuous because occupying only
about 20% of body length and bristles merely up to 3 µm long in vivo; all rows commence at
circumoral kinety with some ordinary cilia and end at similar level posteriorly continuing as
ordinary somatic kineties, except of row 3 (Fig. 62a, e, j, l, o, 63c, g, h; Table 22). Brush row
1 slightly shorter than rows 2 and 3, composed of an average of 25 dikinetids associated with
about 3 µm long, slightly inflated bristles. Longest brush row 2 composed of an average of 30
dikinetids associated with about 2.5 µm long anterior bristles and 3 µm long posterior bristles.
Brush row 3 composed of an average of 23 dikinetids more loosely spaced (~ 1.5 µm) than those
of rows 1 and 2 (~ 1.2 µm), anterior bristle of dikinetids about 1.5 µm long, posterior 2 µm; with
monokinetal tail extending to mid-body, posterior half of tail heteromorphic comprising about
1.5 µm long bristles mixed with ordinary cilia (Fig. 62a, e, 63c, g, h; Table 22).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end slanted 45°–60°, on average 80% as long as widest trunk
region; moderately distinct because slightly ∞-shaped in lateral view and about 4 µm high.
Surface flat to slightly convex, concave only at temporary cytostome near dorsal bulge end;
cuneate or narrowly obovate in frontal view (Fig. 62a, c, f–h, j, l, m, 63a, b, e, g, m; Table
22). Circumoral kinety cuneate, slightly rugged by somatic ciliary rows, composed of ordinarily
spaced dikinetids each associated with a cilium and a faintly impregnated nematodesma. Oral
basket hardly recognizable in vivo but fairly distinct in protargol preparations (Fig. 62j, l–n, 63b;
Table 22).
Resting cyst: Mature resting cysts globular and colourless, covered by an about 7 µm thick, solid
mucous layer colonized by various bacteria. Cyst proper on average 40.3 µm across (M = 40.0,
SD = 3.4, CV = 8.4, Min = 35.0, Max = 45.0, n = 15). Cyst wall smooth, bipartite, about 1.5
µm thick. Cytoplasm packed with macronucleus and lipid droplets (Fig. 62i, 63d). Cysts soon
became parasitized by a fungus (Fig. 63i, j, n), possibly a Ciliatomyces species, as described by
Foissner & Foissner (1986, 1995).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at type locality and in sample (70), where it became
abundant five and 12 days, respectively, after setting up the non-flooded Petri dish cultures. The
slender shape and the occurrence in sample (70) indicate that P. stetteri is a “true” soil ciliate
tolerating brackish conditions.
Remarks: Spathidium stetteri resembles S. procerum (Fig. 62k), as redescribed by Foissner
(1984). They differ in two main features: body shape (length:width ratio 7:1 vs. 12:1 on average)
and number of ciliary rows (17 vs. 10 on average). The values for → S. procerum have been
confirmed in a population from the Dominican Republic. Possibly, there is a further different
feature which, however, has not yet been investigated in S. procerum: the heteromorphic bristle
tail of brush row 3 (Fig. 62a, e, 63c). Spathidium stetteri is easily confused with S. ascendens, as
redesribed by Foissner (1987c). They differ by the length of the extrusomes (6 vs. 8–12 µm), the
number of ciliary rows (17 vs. 21), the length of the oral bulge (19 vs. 26 µm) and, especially, by
the resting cyst (wall smooth vs. spiny).

Spathidium inopinatum nov. spec. (Fig. 64a–h, j–m; Table 23)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 135 × 18 µm. Very narrowly spatulate with oblique, oblong oral
bulge about as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus oblong, on average 26 × 5 µm in
protargol preparations; micronucleus discoidal. Mature extrusomes in vivo slightly curved rods
about 6 × 0.5 µm in size. One size type of cortical granules. On average 9 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly
modified to a heterostichad dorsal brush with longest row 2 occupying 16% of body length on
average; row 1 longer than row 3.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (14), i. e., soil from a Tachypogon savanna in the outskirts of the
town of Puerto Ayacucho, 67°36’W 5°41’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective inopinatus (unexpected) refers to the unexpectedly short
macronucleus in this long and slender species.
Description: Size in vivo 110–180 × 15–25 µm, usually about 135 × 18 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 23 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage; length:width ratio also highly variable, viz., 5.3–10.2:1, on average about 7.8:1 in
protargol preparations (Table 23). Body narrowly spatulate to cylindroidal, unflattened, neck
indistinct in very slender cells; both ends narrowly rounded, widest in or slightly posterior to
mid-body (Fig. 64a, e, j, l, m; Table 23). Nuclear apparatus in or near mid-body (Fig. 64a, e, l;
Table 23). Macronucleus oblong to cylindroidal, very rarely spiral, 40 × 5 µm in a live specimen,
in protargol preparations 26 × 5 µm on average; with many small nucleoli. One micronucleus
attached to macronucleus, discoidal, in vivo about 4–5 × 2–3 × 1–2 µm; does not impregnate
in one third of specimens. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, some excretory pores in
pole area (Fig. 64f). Mature extrusomes form a row each in right and left half of oral bulge;
slightly curved rods with rounded ends and a size of 5–6 × 0.4–0.6 µm in vivo (Fig. 64a–c, m);
do not impregnate with the protargol method used. Cortex flexible, contains about five rows of
colourless, narrowly spaced granules between two kineties each; granules usually impregnating
with protargol blurring trunk ciliary pattern (Fig. 64d). Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to
many lipid droplets up to 5 µm across (Fig. 64a). Swims rather rapidly, showing great flexibility
between soil particles.
Somatic cilia in vivo about 8 µm long, arranged in an average of nine ordinarily spaced, bipolar
rows abutting on circumoral kinety in Spathidium pattern (Fig. 64a, e, f, h, j, k; Table 23).
Dorsal brush dorsolaterally located, three-rowed each with a distinct monokinetal anterior tail,
heterostichad because row 3 shorter by about 33% than longest row 2 occupying 16% of body
length on average. Brush bristles up to 5 µm long in vivo, not studied in detail. Brush rows 1 and
2 of similar length, composed of 12–13 dikinetids on average; dikinetal portion of row 3 only half
as long as in rows 1 and 2, composed of an average of 8 kinetids followed by a monokinetal tail
extending to second body third with 1–2 µm long bristles (Fig. 64a, h, k; Table 23).

h), 20 µm (j, k), and 50 µm (a, e, f, l).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end slanted by about 45°, about as long as widest trunk region,
slightly convex, oblong with bluntly pointed ventral end; inconspicuous in vivo because short
and only 3–4 µm high (Fig. 64a, b, e–h, j–m; Table 23). Circumoral kinety of same shape as oral
bulge, continuous, that is, not interrupted by somatic kineties; composed of an average of 31
comparatively widely spaced dikinetids each associated with a cilium, a fibre extending into the
pharynx, and an oral basket rod. Oral basket short compared to body length, of ordinary structure
(Fig. 64f, g, j, l; Table 23).
202

Occurrence and ecology: As yet, found at type locality and in a sample nearby. It appeared two
weeks after rewetting the samples and remained sparse in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures.
Very likely, S. inopinatum is a “true” soil inhabitant because it is slender and has a moderate size.
Remarks: There is only one species, S. etoschense Foissner at al., 2002, which can be confused
with S. inopinatum because it has a similar shape of body and macronucleus and a similar number
of ciliary rows (Table 23). However, S. etoschense has acicular (vs. rod-shaped) extrusomes
and row 1 of the dorsal brush is shorter (vs. longer) than row 3. Further, the macronucleus of S.
etoschense is considerably longer than in S. inopinatum (ratio body length: macronucleus length
2.6 vs. 5.2; Table 23); likewise, the oral bulge of S. etoschense is distinctly longer than in S.
inopinatum (23 vs. 12 µm; Table 23).
There is also some similarity with Apospathidium atypicum which, inter alia, has a similar body
size and number of ciliary rows as well as the same macronucleus type (for a review, see Foissner
et al. 2002). However, A. atypicum has the posterior body region distinctly narrowed (vs. slightly)
and the contractile vacuole far subterminal (vs. terminal). Further, it has somatic extrusomes
absent from S. inopinatum.

Spathidium curiosum Foissner & Xu nov. spec. (Fig. 65a–j; Table 24)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 120 × 30 µm. Narrowly spatulate with oblique, oblong oral bulge about
two thirds as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus long and tortuous; multimicronucleate.
Oral extrusomes in vivo about 15 × 1 µm, rod-shaped to indistinctly acicular, with conspicuous
subterminal lenticular inflation. One size type of cortical granules. On average 21 ciliary rows,
3 anteriorly modified to a heterostichad dorsal brush with longest row 2 occupying 23% of body
length on average.
Type locality: Surface soil of a savanna in the Parque Nacional Torres del Paine, Lago de Oros,
Chile, 73°26’W 51°0’S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective curiosus (curious) refers to the drumstick-shaped extrusomes.
Description: Size in vivo 100–170 × 20–40 µm, usually about 120 × 30 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 24 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage; length:width ratio 3.1–5.8:1, on average near 4:1 both in vivo and in protargol
preparations (Table 24). Size and shape similar to Epispathidium terricola Foissner, 1987c

but usually narrowly spatulate to slightly obclavate with rather indistinct neck flattened up to
2:1; anterior end oblique, posterior rounded, widest posterior of mid-body (Fig. 65a, c, d, i, j;
Table 24). Macronucleus in middle quarters of cell, long and tortuous, contains many globular
nucleoli up to 2 µm across; in all specimens seen surrounded by more or less flattened, variform
structures, possibly decaying macronuclear material and/or micronuclei, with an average size of
7 × 4 µm and with many argyrophilic granules causing a dotted appearance. Several micronuclei
near and attached to macronuclear strand, about 5 × 2 µm in size (Fig. 65a, c, d, g, i, j; Table 24).
Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, some excretory pores in pole area. Mature oral bulge
extrusomes in vivo about 15 × 0.7–1 µm in size, rod-shaped to slightly acicular and indistinctly
curved, with conspicuous subterminal lenticular inflation; rarely impregnate lightly with the
protargol method used while cytoplasmic developmental stages of various shapes and up to 15
µm in length impregnate deeply; in oral region 2–3 µm long, deeply impregnating rods, possibly
a small type of extrusomes overlooked in vivo (Fig. 65a, b, f, g, j). Cortex flexible, contains

about ten rows of colourless, narrowly spaced granules – usually impregnating with protargol
and blurring ciliary pattern between each two ciliary rows (Fig. 65h). Cytoplasm colourless,
contains some lipid droplets as well as small and up to 40 µm-sized food vacuoles with remnants
of amoebae, flagellates and ciliates (Fig 65a). Swims rather rapidly.
Somatic cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 21 ordinarily spaced, bipolar,
ordinarily ciliated rows abutting on circumoral kinety in typical Spathidium pattern (Fig. 65a,
c, d, e; Table 24). Dorsal brush dorsolaterally located, three-rowed, heterostichad because row
3 shorter by about 50% than longest row 2 occupying 23% of body length on average; all rows
commence with some ordinary cilia, and rows 1 and 2 continue as somatic kineties posteriorly.
Brush bristles minute, length increases from about 2 µm anteriorly to 3 µm posteriorly. Brush
rows 1 and 2 end at same level on average, composed of an average of 23 and 24 dikinetids,
respectively; dikinetal portion of row 3 only half as long as in rows 1 and 2, composed of an
average of 10 dikinetids followed by a monokinetal tail extending to near body end with 1–2 µm
long bristles (Fig. 65a, e; Table 24).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end slanted by about 45°, rather conspicuous, though only
about two thirds as long as widest trunk region, because up to 5 µm high and distinctly separate
from body proper; flat to slightly convex, oblong with both ends broadly rounded (Fig. 65a,
c–g, i, j; Table 24). Circumoral kinety slightly ∞-shaped in lateral view while oblong when seen
frontally, ventral end broadly, rarely narrowly rounded, continuous, composed of ordinarily spaced
dikinetids each associated with a cilium, a fibre extending into the pharynx, and a long oral basket
rod. Nematodesmata (oral basket rods) rather conspicuous in the protargol preparations because
bundled and extending to mid-body (Fig. 65c, f, j).
Occurrence and ecology: At type locality, S. curiosum was very rare in the non-flooded Petri
dish culture. We found it also in Australia, viz., in soil from sugar cane fields in the outskirts of
the towns of Cairns and Eubenangee.
Remarks: Spathidium curiosum differs from all described spathidids by the curious shape of the
extrusomes (toxicysts). We carefully checked this feature in three populations (see above) because
they are similar to developing extrusomes in several other spathidids. There is a considerable
overall similarity of S. curiosum with Epispathidium terricola Foissner, 1987c. They differ in the
number of ciliary rows (21 vs. 39), the ciliary pattern (Spathidium vs. indistinct Epispathidium
pattern), and the length of the extrusomes (15 µm vs. 40 µm).
Spathidium duschli nov. spec. (Fig. 66a–p, 67a–u; Table 25)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 200 × 35 µm. Narrowly to very narrowly spatulate with oblique,
cuneate oral bulge approximately as long as widest trunk region. About 100 ellipsoid, scattered
macronuclear nodules; multimicronucleate. Oral extrusomes asymmetrically obclavate, circa
7 × 0.8 µm, proximal end strongly argyrophilic. One size type of cortical granules. About 20
ciliary rows, those in dorsal half of right side attached to circumoral kinetofragments, as in
Protospathidium; dorsal brush inconspicuous, isostichad and of ordinary length occupying 25%
of body length.

Type material: 1 holotype, 3 paratype, and 4 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated
specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz
(LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the

Description: The two populations studied in vivo and in protargol preparations are very similar,
except for the number of macronuclear nodules and micronuclei (both doubled in type population
specimens) and the length of the brush rows while the number of dikinetids composing the brush is

almost identical, suggesting the length differences as culture effect. Thus, the diagnosis includes
both populations, emphasizing, however, the type. The scanning electron micrographs are based
on cultivated specimens of a third population found in the Morrocoy National Park.
Size highly variable, viz., 120–300 × 20–45 µm in vivo, usually about 200 × 35 µm, as calculated
from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 25 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage; length:width ratio 3.5–8:1, on average near 6:1 both in vivo and in protargol-
impregnated specimens while about 5:1 in SEM preparations (n = 8). Narrowly to very narrowly

spatulate with oblique anterior (oral) end, rather distinct neck, and rounded posterior end, widest
usually in middle third of body; flattened only in hyaline oral region. Slender, almost parallel-
sided specimens frequent and anteriorly curved dorsally and right laterally; thus, swimming
and longitudinally rotating specimens describe a wide circle with anterior body region, looking
like some asymmetric Enchelyodon species or a swimming cone (Fig. 66a, h, k, 67a, b, f).
Macronuclear nodules and micronuclei scattered throughout body, except for oral and contractile
vacuole region; nodules globular to oblong, on average ellipsoid, about 8 × 4 µm in protargol
preparations; nucleoli of ordinary size and number. Micronuclei globular to broadly ellipsoid,
about 3 µm across, usually impregnate deeply and thus well distinguishable from more faintly
stained other cell inclusions (Fig. 66a, l, n; Table 25). Contractile vacuole in rear end, on average
seven excretory pores scattered in pole area (Fig. 66a, k, l; Table 25). Mature extrusomes in
vivo asymmetrically obclavate and 6–8 × 0.7–1 µm in size; rod-shaped to slightly acicular and
faintly impregnated in protargol preparations, except for deeply impregnated anterior and/or
posterior end, forming a dotted line each in and underneath oral bulge (Fig. 66a–c, e, l, 67c, h–j,
n; Table 25). Released extrusomes of typical toxicyst structure, on average (n = 8) 13.1 µm (10–
17) long in vivo (Fig. 66d, 67d, e, n). Cortex colourless and flexible, rather distinctly furrowed
by ciliary rows, about 1 µm thick and jelly-like due to compact granules forming about ten
conspicuous, sometimes bifurcated rows between each two kineties (Fig. 66f, 67u); individual
granules highly refractive, about 0.8 × 0.4 µm in size, do not stain with methyl green-pyronin but
slowly disappear, likely releasing a very hyaline substance forming an 1–3 µm thick, yellowish
layer in protargol preparations, a rare feature in spathidiids (Fig. 66g). Cytoplasm packed with
macronuclear nodules and lipid droplets 0.5–4 µm across. Feeds on various middle-sized ciliates,
such as Gonostomum affine, and likely also on heterotrophic flagellates digested in 5–50 µm-
sized vacuoles (Fig. 66a). Swims moderately rapid by rotation about main body axis, looking like
a swimming cone as described above.
Cilia 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of about 20 equidistant, frequently slightly
disturbed (broken, shortened etc.), densely ciliated rows abutting on circumoral kinety in typical
Spathidium pattern. Right side ciliary rows anteriorly distinctly curved dorsally and touching
circumoral kinety, rarely still attached to the individual kinetofragments, forming protospathidiid
pattern in dorsal half; left side rows densely ciliated anteriorly and abutting on continuous
circumoral kinety; leftmost ventral and first left side kinety curved anteriorly, producing a
slightly widened area (Fig. 66a, i–p; 67a, b, f; Table 25). Dorsal brush occupies about 25% of
body length, inconspicuous because bristles only up to 4 µm long; isostichad with rows 1 and 3
slightly shorter than row 2, all rows with anterior tail and more or less irregular in over 50% of
specimens, that is, have overlapping or non-overlapping breaks and lacking or supernumerary
dikinetids forming short rows (Fig. 66a, m–p, 67f, g, k–m; Table 25). Further details recognizable
in scanning electron micrographs (Fig. 67f, g, k–m): bristles become shorter posteriorly, where
rows 1and 2 are often slightly heteromorphic; bristles of rows 1 and 2 distinctly clavate, those of
row 3 inflated only in anterior portion; posterior bristle of dikinetids shorter by up to 50% in rows
1 and 3; posterior tail of row 3 short, consisting of only 13–16 (n = 3) minute (~ 1 µm) bristles
(seen also in type locality specimens).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end slanted by 40–70° (× = 52°, n = 12), on average
about as long as widest trunk region, moderately distinct, that is, slightly separate from body

proper and up to 5 µm high in vivo; surface flat to moderately convex, in frontal view oblong
to rather distinctly cuneate (length:width ratio 3–4:1, n = 6) and frequently slightly curved
to left side. Cytopharyngeal opening not impregnated with protargol but recognizable as a
minute concavity near dorsal bulge end in scanning electron micrographs. Circumoral kinety
of same shape as oral bulge, basically continuous (but see above), composed of narrowly
spaced dikinetids each associated with a cilium, an oral basket rod, and a faintly impregnated
fibre extending into oral bulge. Nematodesmata fairly distinct and bundled, forming a rather
conspicuous basket in protargol-impregnated specimens (Fig. 66a, e, i–p, 67a, b, o–q, Table 25).
Ontogenesis: Some dividers were observed in the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 67r–t). Early
dividers show a slight indentation in the prospective fission area; division blebs; and the gradual
replacement of parental somatic cilia by brush bristles during opisthe dorsal brush formation.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only in Venezuela, viz., in soil of two Mahadjas
(organically fertilized fields) from the surroundings of Pt. Ayacucho and in the soil/mud
mixture from very flat, slightly saline (4‰) grassland puddles on the north coast (Morrocoy
National Park). The type locality Mahadja was fertilized three years ago and out of use in the
year when the sample was taken. The second site is in the neighbourhood of the type locality.
This Mahadja was in the first year of use and cultivated with pepper, pumpkin, and yucca. The
material collected was a mixture of soil and litter sieved off the fine-grained soil to a depth
of 10 cm. In the Morrocoy National Park, S. duschli occurred with two other peculiar ciliates,
viz., Sleighophrys pustulata and Luporinophrys micelae, both described by Foissner (2005).
Spathidium duschli is a large but rather slender ciliate; nonetheless, with an average width of
35 µm, it can live only in large soil pores; likely, it is a semiterrestrial litter species, as indicated
by the occurrence in the soil/mud mixture of grassland ponds. We could cultivate S. duschli
some weeks in Eau de Volvic enriched with a few squashed wheat grains to stimulate growth
of food organisms, that is, the native flagellate and ciliate community. Abundances were
low in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures and the dirty pure culture from type locality while
considerable numbers developed in the dirty pure culture from the Morrocoy National Park.
216

Remarks: Spathidium duschli is easily distinguished from the other members of the elongatum
group (will be described in Vol. II of the revision of the spathidiids) by the macronuclear pattern
(scattered nodules vs. a tortuous strand). Scattered macronuclear nodules occur also in some
other Spathidium species which, however, lack the argyrophilic extrusome end and are much
stouter (S. seppelti, S. multinucleatum) and/or have fewer ciliary rows (S. turgitorum).
Spathidium dispar Foissner & Xu nov. spec. (Fig. 68a–n, 69a–o, 70a–i, 71a–x;
Table 26)
Diagnosis (based on Venezuelan type and an Austrian population): Size about 300 × 35 µm in
vivo. Slenderly spatulate to cylindroid with strongly oblique, slightly cuneate oral bulge about
1.2 times as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus long and tortuous; multimicronucleate.
Oral extrusomes acicular, about 7 × 0.8 µm in size, ends deeply argyrophilic. One type of cortical
granules. On average 23 ciliary rows, those in dorsal half of right side attached to the circumoral
kinetofragments in Protospathidium pattern; dorsal brush inconspicuous, isostichad and of
ordinary length occupying 24% of body length.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (57), i. e., moss on stones and soil from the Cueva del Indio, a
small cave near the village of Chichiriviche, north coast of the Morrocoy National Park, 67°13’W
11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype, 2 paratype, and 3 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated
specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz
(LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective dispar (unlike) expresses that this species is different from a
similar, not yet described species.
Description: This species was independently discovered and studied from two widely separate
sites, viz., Venezuela (type) and Austria. None the less, the populations match very well, even in a
curious feature, that is, the Protospathidium-like ciliary pattern on the dorsal half of the right side.
Thus, conspecificity is beyond reasonable doubt, and the diagnosis includes both populations;
however, the different shape of the micronuclei (lenticular vs. broadly elliptic) could be a
subspecific character. The morphometry is incomplete because the species was rare at both sites.
Size highly variable, viz., 220–350 × 30–40 µm in vivo, usually near 270 × 30 µm in Venezuelan
population and 200–450 × 30–55 µm, frequently about 320 × 45 µm in Austrian specimens,
as calculated from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 26 adding
10% preparation shrinkage; prepared cells somewhat inflated and thus wider. Slenderly spatulate
to cylindroid with considerably varying length:width ratio of about 5–10:1, on average 8:1 in
protargol-impregnated cells of both populations; live specimens, however, frequently stouter in
Austrian (approx. 7:1) than Venezuelan (approx. 9:1) population. Neck of ordinary distinctness,
more pronounced in Venezuelan than in Austrian specimens, trunk widest in or posterior to mid-
body, flattened only in oral region. Anterior (oral) body end steeply (about 60°) truncate and

distinctly sigmoid in live Venezuelan specimens while flat to moderately convex in Austrian and
prepared Venezuelan cells; posterior end narrowly to moderately broadly rounded and frequently
bulbous and/or wrinkled due to the contractile vacuole contained (Fig. 68a, d, e, k, 69d, f, k, n,
o, 71o, p; Table 26). Macronucleus extends in middle quarters of cell, basically a long, tortuous,
irregularly nodulated strand with many up to 2.5 µm-sized nucleoli; occasionally in two long
pieces. Many micronuclei attached and near to macronucleus, exact number not recognizable due
to many similar-sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions; individual micronuclei lenticular
(6 × 2.5 µm) in Venezuelan and broadly ellipsoid (3 × 2.5 µm) in Austrian specimens (Fig. 68a, k,
69d, f, g, k, 70a–c, 71k, l; Table 26). Contractile vacuole in rear body end, several excretory pores
scattered in pole area; definitely, no second contractile vacuole in anterior body half. Oral bulge
extrusomes very similar in both populations, viz., acicular to almost rod-shaped with obliquely
truncate distal portion, of ordinary thickness, in vivo approximately 6–7 × 0.8 µm in Venezuelan
and 8–10 × 0.8 µm in Austrian specimens; impregnate more or less deeply with the protargol
method used, especially the ends (only the proximal end in Venezuelan cells), producing a dotted
line each on and posterior of oral bulge. Exploded extrusomes of typical toxicyst structure, 12–20
µm long in vivo. Developing cytoplasmic extrusomes of same shape and impregnation capability

as mature oral bulge toxicysts, but only 3–5 × 0.5 µm in size (Fig. 68a–c, l, 69a–d, f, h, l, m, 70g–
i, 71b–i, k, m, n). Cortex very flexible, contains about eight rows of colourless, brilliant granules
between each two kineties; individual granules about 1 × 0.5 µm in Venezuelan and 0.8 × 0.3 µm
in Austrian cells (Fig. 68i, j, 71a). Cytoplasm colourless, usually packed with developing and
mature extrusomes, lipid droplets up to 10 µm across, and some food vacuoles with remnants of
various ciliates, e. g., Halteria grandinella; an Austrian specimen contained a just ingested, still
intact, over 100 µm-sized oxytrichid hypotrich (Fig. 69g); subterminal frequently a large vacuole
with indigestible debris. Swims and glides rather rapidly, showing worm-like flexibility.
Cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 22 (Venezuela) or 24 (Austria) equidistant,
mostly bipolar, densely ciliated (average ciliary distance 1.5 µm, Table 26) rows abutting on
circumoral kinety in typical Spathidium pattern, except in dorsal half of right side, where most
specimens have a Protospathidium-like pattern because the circumoral kinetofragments are
separated by minute gaps and adhere to the ciliary rows, similar to the left side, where the kineties
are very densely ciliated anteriorly (Fig. 68a, k, m, n, 69h, i, k, l, 70d–f, 71o–r, v, w; Table 26).
Dorsal brush inconspicuous in both populations because occupying only 24% of body length and
bristles merely up to 4 µm long and only slightly inflated in vivo; dikinetids more widely spaced
in Austrian than in Venezuelan specimens, as shown by the lower total number (144 vs. 164) in
spite of the larger cell size (292 vs. 240 µm, Table 26). Details of rows and bristles very similar
in Venezuelan and Austrian specimens: all rows commence with some ordinary cilia anteriorly
and end posteriorly at nearly same level, with middle row 2 slightly longer than rows 1 and 3;
row 3 with a monokinetal tail of 2 µm long, rod-shaped bristles extending to mid-body; bristles
indistinctly clavate and about 4 µm long in anterior three quarters of brush, gradually decrease to
229

2 µm in posterior quarter, anterior bristle of pairs decreases in length to < 0.5 µm (Fig. 68a, h, k,
m, 69e, k, i, 71s–u, w, x; Table 26).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end strongly slanted by an angle of about 60°, in vivo
approximately 1.5 times as long as widest trunk region, while on average only slightly longer
than trunk width in protargol preparations (Table 26), likely because cells became inflated by the
preparation and few specimens were available; distinct in live Venezuelan specimens because
about 6 µm high and often neatly sigmoidal, while usually convex or flat in prepared cells and
in Austrian specimens; in frontal view elongate elliptic or slightly cuneate in both populations,
dorsal end conspicuously widened in some Austrian specimens; with minute, obconical depression
(cytopharyngeal entrance) near dorsal end distinct in only few specimens (Fig. 68a, b, d–g, k,
69a, d, e, f, 70a, b, d–f, 71j, k, m–r). Circumoral kinety of same shape as oral bulge, basically
continuous, except of dorsal half of right side where individual fragments are separated by minute
gaps, as described above; composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids each associated with a cilium,
an oral basket rod, and a faintly impregnated fibre extending into oral bulge. Nematodesmata and
oral basket of usual structure (Fig. 68f, g, m, n, 69i–l, 70a, b, d–f, 71j, k, o–r; Table 26).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found in mosses from Venezuela (type locality) and in Austria,
where it occurred in slightly saline grassland soil (pH 8.1) from the surroundings of the town
of Illmitz, Burgenland, 47°45’N 16°48’E. The species was rare in the non-flooded Petri dish
cultures from both sites, that is, less than 15 specimens were found in eight protargol slides each.
However, the Austrian population became rather abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish culture
after one month, and thus could be studied in the scanning electron microscope. With its slender,
highly flexible body, S. dispar can exploit even small soil pores.
Remarks: The large size, the slender body, the long and tortuous macronucleus, the acicular
extrusomes, and the circumoral ciliary pattern distinguish S. dispar from all described congeners.
Enchelariophrya nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Spathidiida (?) with ciliary rows slightly curved anteriorly; 3 rows anteriorly
differentiated to a dorsal brush. Oral bulge small; oral basket made of nematodesmata originating
exclusively from first (di?) kinetid of each ciliary row.
Type species: Enchelariophrya wolfi nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the generic name Enchelys (~ eel), the Latin suffix arius (similar to
the genus Enchelaria), and the Greek noun ophrya (eyebrow ~ cilia ~ ciliate), meaning a ciliate
resembling the genus Enchelaria Foissner et al., 2002.
Remarks: The two new species assigned to Enchelariophrya have the same oral apparatus as
Enchelaria Foissner et al., 2002 but have three (vs. two) dorsal brush rows, a feature significant at
genus level (oertel et al. 2008). Otherwise, the problems are the same as mentioned by Foissner
et al. (2002): “Enchelariophrya has an atypical circumoral kinety made of the anterior kinetid of
each somatic ciliary row. This and the anteriorly curved kineties resemble the → Acropisthiidae.
However, Enchelariophrya lacks oralized somatic monokinetids, although we cannot entirely
230

exclude that the anterior kinetid is an oralized somatic kinetid. If so, Enchelariophrya still is
a distinct genus because then it would lack the haptorid oral dikinetids so typical for the →
Acropisthiidae and → Fuscheriidae. On the other hand, a lack of oral dikinetids would relate
Enchelaria and Enchelariophrya to the Enchelyidae which, however, invariably have oralized
monokinetids at the anterior region of the ciliary rows”.
The general appearance of, especially, → E. galapagensis resembles genera like Sikorops Foissner,
2000 and → Enchelyodon. However, the latter has straight ciliary rows and a circumoral kinety
composed of many more dikinetids than ciliary rows. Thus, we propose that Enchelariophrya is
related to the Spathidiidae which not only have anteriorly curved ciliary rows but also contain
genera with tuberculate oral bulge (several → Protospathidium and Arcuospathidium species).
Further, most genera of the Spathidiidae have three dorsal brush rows and much more circumoral
dikinetids than ciliary rows, including Semispathidium, which highly resembles Enchelaria and
Enchelariophrya. To sum up, Enchelariophrya represents a distinct genus, no matter the familial
classification. Figure 72a–g summarizes this discussion.
Enchelariophrya wolfi nov. spec. (Fig. 73a–f, 74a–m; Table 27)
Diagnosis: Size about 75 × 15 µm in vivo. Shape narrowly oblong, rarely slightly obclavate.
On average 45 globular to narrowly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 8 globular micronuclei.
Extrusomes narrowly ovate, about 4 × 0.8 µm. 23 ciliary rows on average, three anteriorly
differentiated to a distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush occupying about 21% body length. Oral
bulge tuberculate, about 4 × 2 µm in size.
Type locality: Humous surface soil (0–5 cm) from an Aechmea paniculigera (Bromeliacea) site
in the surroundings of the village of Quick Step in Cockpit Country, Jamaica, 77°41’W 18°17’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Dedication: We dedicate this new species to Dr. habil. Klaus wolF, Electron Microscopy Unit at
the University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica, who made it possible to collect in this area.
Description: Size in vivo about 60–90 × 10–25 µm, usually about 75 × 15 µm, as calculated
from some live measurements and the morphometric data compiled in Table 27 adding 15%
preparation shrinkage. Body often narrowly oblong, sometimes obclavate (length:width ratio
3.6–5:1), anterior region frequently slightly bulbous; rather distinctly flattened laterally (Fig.
73a, d, f, 74a–c, h–j; Table 27). Nuclear apparatus in central three fifths of cell (Fig. 73a, e,
74h–j; Table 27). On average about 45 globular to narrowly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules 3–4
µm in size in vivo and 3.8 × 1.8 µm in protargol preparations, difficult to count because close
together; contain globular and ellipsoid nucleoli. On average eight micronuclei scattered among
macronuclear nodules, about 1.5 µm across in prepared specimens. Contractile vacuole in rear
body end; one large excretory pore out of pole centre (Fig. 73a, f, 74a–c, j, m). Mature extrusomes
attached to oral bulge and studded in cytoplasm, narrowly ovate to indistinctly lenticular, 3–5 ×
0.8 µm in size, do not impregnate with the protargol method used; many lenticular developing

Fig. 72a–g. Oral structures and anterior somatic kinety pattern of some haptorid ciliates (from Foissner 1984 and Foissner et al.
2002, 2010a). a: Apoenchelys has straight somatic kineties. The oral basket is made of nematodesmata originating from oralized
somatic monokinetids because circumoral dikinetids are absent. b: Sikorops has curved somatic kineties. The oral basket is made
of nematodesmata originating from dikinetids of a special circumoral kinety and of nematodesmata originating from oralized
somatic monokinetids. c: Diplites has straight somatic kineties. The oral basket is made of nematodesmata originating from
the widely spaced dikinetids of the circumoral kinety and of nematodesmata originating from oralized somatic monokinetids.
d, e: Spathidium and Protospathidium have curved somatic kineties. The oral basket is made of nematodesmata originating
from the circumoral dikinetids that form a more or less closed circumoral kinety (Spathidium) or dikinetal circumoral fragments
(Protospathidium). f: Semispathidium has curved somatic kineties. The oral basket is made of nematodesmata originating from
the circumoral dikinetids (kinety) that are usually much more numerous than the somatic kineties. g: Enchelyodon has straight
somatic kineties. The oral basket is made of nematodesmata originating from the circumoral dikinetids (kinety) that are usually
much more numerous than the somatic kineties. Enchelariophrya is different from all (Fig. 72f): the somatic kineties are curved
and the anteriormost (di?) kinetid of each somatic kinety produces a nematodesma contributing to the oral basket. BU – oral bulge,

extrusomes in cytoplasm (Fig. 73c, 74d–g). Cortex colourless, about 1 µm thick, contains several
rows of broadly ellipsoid granules about 0.7 × 0.5 µm in size between each two kineties (Fig.
73b). Cytoplasm colourless, without peculiarities. Food not observed and not recognizable in the
preparations. Swims rapidly by rotation about main body axis, showing pronounced flexibility.
Somatic cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 23 meridional, narrowly spaced
rows slightly curved at anterior end; on average 52 narrowly spaced kinetids per row, more
densely spaced in oral area (Fig. 73a, d, f, 74h, i, k; Table 27). Dorsal brush composed of three
rows, occupies on average 21% of body length, distinctly heterostichad: row 1 slightly longer
than row 2; row 3 shorter than row 1 by about 60% and with a monokinetal tail extending to rear
body end with 1 µm long bristles; dikinetids too close together to be counted; no suture, neither
left or right of dorsal brush (Fig. 73a, d, 74h, k; Table 27).
Oral bulge minute, tuberculate, about 4 × 2 µm in vivo and thus difficult to recognize (Fig. 73a,
d, f, 74b, c, h–j, k, l). No circumoral kinety recognizable, oral basket rods originate from first
kinetid of each ciliary row. Oral basket obconical, in protargol-impregnated specimens about 15
µm long (Fig.73f, 74j, l).

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type locality and at Venezuelan site (56).
Remarks: Regarding similar species, E. wolfi is distinct from Enchelaria multinucleata Foissner
et al., 2002 in body shape (oblong or obclavate vs. lageniform or cylindroidal), body size (75 ×
15 µm vs. 160 × 20 µm), the number of macronuclear nodules (on average 45 vs. 127), and the
number of ciliary rows (on average 24 vs. 17). Within the genus Enchelyodon, there are very
few multinucleate species, all distinctly different from E. wolfi. Perhaps E. granosus lePsi, 1957
should be mentioned because it resembles E. wolfi in size and shape. However, it has a broad oral
bulge and a rod-shaped axial structure. Unfortunately, lePsi (1957) could not observe the nuclear
apparatus and based the description on a single specimen from decaying Sphagnum.

Enchelys lajacola Foissner & oertel, 2009 (Fig. 75a–m, r, 76a–x; Table 28)
Improved diagnosis (includes type population): Size in vivo about 125 × 40 µm; narrowly
(theronts) to broadly (trophonts) lageniform or obclavate. Macronuclear strand tortuous, 60 µm
long on average. Extrusomes form a ring in oral bulge, rod-shaped, about 10 × 0.5 µm. On
average 18 ciliary rows, 3 differentiated to a distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with longest
row 2 occupying about 22% of body length. Oral bulge about 7 × 3 µm in protargol preparations.
Voucher locality: Galápagos site (71), i. e., surface soil under a Pandanus palm in the garden of
the hotel San Fernando, Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz Island, S 90°18’W 0°44’.
Voucher material: 4 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited
in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description: Details of the oral apparatus are difficult to investigate because the oral bulge
extrusomes impregnate deeply, hidding most of the ciliary pattern. Thus, some data are vague.
Further, the protargol preparations are mediocre because all specimens are studded with more or
less deeply impregnated food vacuoles.
Size in vivo 100–180 × 30–80 µm, usually about 130 × 40 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 28 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
shape highly variable, i. e., indistinctly to distinctly and very slenderly to broadly obclavate,

partially depending on amount of food ingested (Fig. 75a, d, g–j, k, l, 76d–g, j, k, l, n, p); when
transferred to the microscope slide and under slight coverslip pressure contractile by about one
third of body length, especially anterior body half (Fig. 75f, 76d–g). Anterior body portion
(“neck”), in contrast, little variable, viz., about 10 µm in diameter irrespective of width in mid-
body (Fig. 75a, d, g–j, k, l, 76d–g, j, k, l, n–p; Table 28). Macronucleus in central quarters of cell,
a highly tortuous strand about 70 × 7 µm in protargol preparations; nucleoli reticulate (Fig. 75a,
k, l, 76f, j, k, l; Table 28). Likely several micronuclei but not unequivocally separable from food
inclusions. Contractile vacuole and cytopyge in posterior body end, several excretory pores (Fig.
75a, l, 76f, g, i, j; Table 28). Extrusomes rod-shaped with rounded ends, 10–11 × ~ 0.5 µm in size
both in vivo and in protargol preparations, form a ring in oral bulge and scattered in anterior body
half, impregnate deeply with the protargol method used; cytoplasmic extrusomes occasionally
acicular (Fig. 75a, b, d, e, k, 76a, b, h, j, l, m, p; Table 28). Exploded extrusomes of typical
toxicyst structure, about 30 µm long (Fig. 75e, 76c). Cortex very flexible, contains countless
minute granules (~ 0.2 µm), forming about 10 slightly oblique rows between two ciliary rows
each (Fig. 75c). Cytoplasm colourless but dark at low magnification (≤ 100×) due to many food
inclusions and lipid droplets up to 10 µm across. Of four Colpoda species present (C. steinii,
C. maupasi, C. inflata, C. cuccullus), only C. inflata was ingested whole, showing strict food
selection and an extraordinarily extensibility of the thin neck (Fig. 75d, 76n, p). The large food

vacuoles disintegrate into many small globules with different affinity to protargol, suggesting
food segregation (Fig. 75a, d, 76b, d–g, i–n). Swims rapidly moving oral portion slightly to and
fro possibly sensing for food.
Cilia in vivo 9 µm long, arranged in an average of 19 meridional, widely spaced rows composed
of loosely spaced cilia; anterior portion of rows slightly curved and densely ciliated. Dorsal brush
distinctly heterostichad and isomorph, longest row 2 occupies 22% of body length on average; all
rows possibly with a short anterior tail of ciliated monokinetids; row 3 extends to posterior body
end with monokinetal, about 2 µm long bristles (Fig. 75a, k, m, r, 76l, m, o; Table 28).
Oral bulge discoid, about 7 × 3 µm in protargol preparations, slightly oblique, contains a circular

array of toxicysts. Circumoral kinety absent. Nematodesmata very fine, originate from anterior
kinetids of each ciliary row (Fig. 75a, b, d, k–m, r, 76j, m, o; Table 28).
Occurrence and ecology: At the type locality it was numerous in the non-flooded Petri dish
culture three days after rewetting the sample. Likewise, it was numerous in the Galápagos sample
six days after re-wetting the sample.
Remarks: Ciliates of this type are very difficult to classify and to identify because they have
few characters. The observations match those of Foissner & oertel (2009). Although there are
several similar genera, only Sikorops Foissner, 1999b has the same constellation of characters.
However, the three Sikorops species (Foissner 1999b, 2000b, Foissner & Xu 2007, Foissner et

rod-shaped (Fig. 75e) extrusomes.
As far as we know, such a population has not been described, although several of the old species
look quite similar in vivo, especially from the genera Enchelys and Enchelyodon. All described
Enchelys species have a single, short macronucleus (vs. an about 70 µm long strand) or several
small nodules (Kahl 1930a). Enchelyodon elegans var. striatus Kahl, 1930a, b, which resembles
E. galapagensis in the shape and size of the body, the macronucleus, and the oral bulge, is a
limnetic species with about 30 ciliary rows (vs. terrestrial and 19 ciliary rows); the extrusomes
are not known.

Phialinides bicaryomorphus nov. spec. (Fig. 77a–i, 78a–f; Table 29)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 110 × 25 µm, can contract half of body length becoming almost
globular. In vivo slightly clavate, when swimming rapidly and in protargol preparations narrowly
to very narrowly ellipsoid. Macronucleus discoid, strongly flattened in middle third, narrow side
view thus dumbbell-shaped. Micronucleus in terminal concavity of macronucleus. Contractile
vacuole and excretory pores subterminal. Extrusomes rod-shaped, about 16 × 1 µm in size. On
average 23 ciliary rows. Oral bulge discoid to hemispheric.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (56), i. e., slightly saline surface mud and soil from temporary
grassland puddles in the surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, Morrocoy National Park,
about 13 km inshore from the north coast, 67°13’ W 11°33’ N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words bi (two), caryon (nucleus), and morphé (shape),
referring to the special shape of the macronucleus.
Description: Size of extended cells in vivo 90–120 × 20–30 µm, on average about 110 × 25 µm,
as calculated from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 29 adding 15%
preparation shrinkage. Length:width ratio 3.6–5.5:1, on average 4.5:1. Can contract to about half
of body length, especially under mild coverslip pressure. Distinctly contracted cells in protargol
preparations 59–75 × 22–30 µm, on average 67 × 26 µm, i. e., length considerably decreases (67
µm vs. 110 µm) while width slightly increases (22–30 µm vs. 17–26 µm). Length:width ratio
2.1–2.9:1, on average 2.6:1, and thus much narrower than in extended cells (4.5:1). Contraction
and extension occur slowly, body length thus possibly underestimated because slightly contracted
specimens are indistinguishable from fully extended ones; however, length error likely small as
indicated by the low variability coefficients (~ 10%, Table 29).
Extended specimens in vivo indistinctly to rather distinctly clavate with widest region posterior
of neck (Fig. 77a); widening lost in protargol-impregnated specimens, very likely due to some
contraction making cells narrowly to very narrowly ellipsoid (Fig. 77b, e, f, 78a, b, e, f); oral
bulge plus head form conspicuous hemispherical protrusion in vivo (Fig. 77a, b, e, g, h). When
swimming rapidly, cells become very narrowly ellipsoid (Fig. 77g). Moderately to distinctly
contracted specimens elongate ellipsoid in vivo (Fig. 77h, 78e), strongly contracted cells almost
globular (Fig. 77i).
Nuclear apparatus slightly posterior of mid-body on average (Table 29). Macronucleus

rows; individual granules strongly refractive, about 0.8 × 0.2 µm in size (Fig. 77k). Cytoplasm
colourless, not dark at low magnification but sometimes studded with lipid droplets up to 5 µm
across, most 1–2 µm. Food not known. Swims rapidly to very rapidly pushing to and fro.
Cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 23 narrowly to ordinarily spaced rows
extending meridionally to slightly spirally from neck to posterior body end, forming a dense
wreath on head; course of rows independent of contraction and extension state of body (Fig.
78e). Kineties composed of 39 ordinarily spaced kinetids on average, commence with an average
of five di- and trikinetids with anterior cilium shortened to about 4 µm. Phialinid ciliary wreath
composed of an average of 13 ciliated monokinetids (Fig. 77a, b, d, 78a, b, e; Table 29).
244

Oral bulge plus head conspicuously hemispherical in vivo, on average about 11 µm high both in
vivo and in protargol preparations (Fig. 77a, g; Table 29). Oral bulge discoid with slightly convex
surface in vivo (Fig. 77a) while discoidal, conical or hemispherical in protargol-impregnated
specimens (Fig. 77b, d, e, f, 78a, b, f), very likely due to some changes during fixation, as
indicated by the high variability coefficient of 44% (Table 29). Head ciliature as typical for genus
and family, cilia about 10 µm long, forming metachronal waves during forward swimming. Oral
basket not impregnated.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in five ephemeral habitats (see chapter 3.1.1). Phialinides
bicaryomorphus was moderately abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish culture three weeks after
rewetting sample (56).
Remarks: The genus Phialinides Foissner, 1988a differs from Phialina bory de st. vinCent,
1824 in having an isolated ciliary wreath on the short neck, i. e., posterior to the head (Fig. 77a,
d, l, 78a, b, e). Although this feature is not always distinct, it is very likely reliable (Foissner et
al. 1999).
Lacrymariids of the Lacrymaria/Phialina/Phialinides type are very difficult to identify because
of a lot of poorly described species. Our attempts to identify the Venezuelan population with
one of the Lacrymaria/Phialina species reviewed by Kahl (1926, 1930a) failed. Likewise, we
did not find it in more recent publications, e. g., vuXanoviCi (1959). As concerns body size and
shape as well as the number of ciliary rows and macronuclear nodules, the Venezuelan population
is possibly most similar to Phialina vertens (stoKes, 1885), as redescribed by Kahl (1926,
1930a), Foissner (1983), and song & wilbert (1989). Unfortunately, it is possible that each
of the redescriptions represents a different species. Kahl’s authoritative redescription shows a
semicircular macronucleus with the micronucleus in curve centre. The P. vertens of song &
wilbert (1989) has an ellipsoid or indistinctly reniform macronucleus with the micronucleus
attached to various sites. The population of Foissner (1983) has the same nuclear pattern as P.
bicaryomorphus but is slightly smaller (in vivo 60–85 µm vs. 90–120 µm), has fewer ciliary rows
(15–20 vs. 20–25), and likely lacks the phialinid ciliary wreath.
Of the three Phialinides species described by Foissner (1988a, Fig. 77l, m), Foissner et al.
(2002), and Foissner & wenZel (2004, Fig. 77j, k), P. bicaryomorphus is unique, inter alia, by
the number (1 vs. 2 or more) and shape (dimorph vs. monomorph) of the macronuclear nodules.
Enchelys terricola Foissner, 1987c
Improved diagnosis: Length in vivo about 115–130 µm; theronts slenderly obclavate, about
30 µm wide, trophonts obclavate, about 40 µm wide. Many macronuclear nodules. Contractile
vacuole in rear end. Mature extrusomes either rod-shaped and about 5 µm long or lanceolate and
6 µm long. On average 16–17 ciliary rows with curved anterior end. Dorsal brush heterostichad,
rows 1 and 2 of similar length, row 3 shorter than longest row 2 by about 60%. Oral bulge about
7 µm wide, oblique with slightly convex surface.
245

Remarks: The body’s length:width ratio was calculated from the original data (Foissner 1987c).
The diagnosis was adapted to the modern standard.
We split E. terricola into two subspecies, differing mainly in the shape of the extrusomes (rod-
like vs. lanceolate). We consider the extrusome shape as an important feature possibly involved
in prey selection. When the extrusome shape of two or more populations is very different (e. g.,
rod-like vs. ellipsoidal), then we consider the populations as different species (Foissner et al. 002,
gabilondo & Foissner 2009).
Enchelys terricola terricola Foissner, 1987c nov. stat.
Diagnosis: As given above; extrusomes rod-shaped.
Type locality: Grassland soil in the outskirts of the town of Salzburg, Austria.
Description: See Foissner (1987c) and Table 30.
Enchelys terricola lanceoplites nov. sspec. (Fig. 79a–l, 80a–k; Table 30)
Diagnosis: As given above; extrusomes lanceolate.
Type locality: Litter and soil from a forest on the Robinson Crusoe Island, 82°W 34°S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin nouns terricola (living in soil) and lancea (lance), and the
Greek noun hoplites (soldiers ~ extrusomes). Thus, lanceoplites means a ciliate with lanceolate
extrusomes.
Description: This species has a distinct life cycle with slender theronts and inflated trophonts.
When not separated in the morphometric analyses, several features get a high variation coefficient,
e. g., 30% for the ratio of body length:width (Table 30).
Size in vivo 90–150 × 25–55 µm, usually about 115 × 30 µm (theronts) or 115 × 40 µm (trophonts),
as calculated from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 30 adding
15% preparation shrinkage. Body length:width ratio on average 3:1 in protargol preparations
(Table 30), about 5:1 in theronts and 2:1 in trophonts (data not shown). Body slenderly obclavate
(theronts) to obclavate (trophonts), neck usually slightly curved ventrally, likely unflattened (Fig.
79a, d, f, i, 80a, g, k). Ten to 30 globular to elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules, each with
a large central nucleolus, accumulated in third quarter of cell. Micronuclei not unequivocally
identified due to many similar cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 79a, e, f, 80a, k). Contractile vacuole
in posterior body end, very likely several excretory pores (Fig. 79a, i). Mature extrusomes
attached to oral bulge, in vivo lanceolate and about 6–7 × 0.8–1.2 µm in size; impregnate lightly to

deeply with the protargol method used, maintaining shape and size; many mature and developing
extrusomes in cytoplasm (Fig. 79a, b, i, 80c, d, g, h; Table 30). Cortex very flexible, contains
several granule rows between two kineties each; granules colourless and hyaline, about 0.7 ×
0.5 µm in size, thus not forming a distinct fringe (Fig. 79c). Cytoplasm colourless, in trophonts
dark at low magnification (≤ ×100), except of hyaline neck, due to many food inclusions. Feeds
on middle-sized ciliates, viz., Colpoda inflata recognizable in one specimen (Fig. 80k); prey
not identifiable in 30 other specimens, suggesting outside lysis by the extrusomes. Large food
vacuoles disintegrate into hundreds of globules 4–10 µm across and with different contents and
protargol affinity, suggesting prey segregation (Fig. 79a, 80a, g, k). Swims slowly rotating about
main body axis.
Cilia in vivo 9 µm long, arranged in an average of 17 meridional, ordinarily (theronts) to widely
(trophonts) spaced rows composed of ordinarily (neck) to narrowly (trunk) spaced cilia; anterior
portion of rows rather distinctly curved and densely ciliated. Dorsal brush heterostichad and
isomorphic, rows 1 and 2 of almost same length with longest row 2 occupying 11% of body
length; row 3 extends to second body third with monokinetal bristles about 3 µm long; all rows
with a short anterior tail of ciliated monokinetids (Fig. 79a, g, j–l, 80a, e, h, j; Table 30). Brush

malformed in about half of specimens, i. e., with supernumerary dikinetids forming a more or
less distinct fourth row.
Oral bulge circular, filled with extrusomes, about 8 × 3 µm in vivo, slightly to distinctly oblique
(20–40°), surface flat to slightly convex. Circumoral kinety absent. Oral basket rods fine, about
18 µm long, originate from one to three oralized somatic monokinetids, forming an indistinct
basket (Fig. 79a, e–g, i–l, 80b, d, g–k; Table 30).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality; appeared with low abundance in the
non-flooded Petri dish culture 17 days after rewetting the sample.
Remarks: Enchelys terricola lanceoplites differs from the European nominal subspecies only
by the shape of the extrusomes, as discussed above. This could result from the very wide spatial
separation of the populations.
The overall appearance of E. terricola terricola and E. terricola lanceoplites is quite similar
to several congeners and other haptorid genera shown in this monograph and in Foissner et
al. (2002), for instance, Enchelaria (three vs. two dorsal brush rows), Enchelariophrya (with
vs. without oralized somatic monokinetids), Enchelyodon (ciliary rows curved vs. not curved
anteriorly), Sikorops (without vs. with oral dikinetids), and Protospathidium (without vs. with
dikinetal oral kinetofragments).

Enchelys tumida nov. spec. (Fig. 81a–l, 82a–c; Table 31)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 200 × 70 µm. Narrowly bursiform with distinct oral bulge containing
about 15 µm long, rod-shaped extrusomes. Macronucleus curved-cylindroid, usually 30% shorter
than body; several globular micronuclei. Cortical granulation dense, plate-like. About 37 ciliary
rows each with 5 to 8 oralized somatic monokinetids. Dorsal brush three-rowed, occupies 22%
of body length, distinctly heterostichad because row 3 shorter by two thirds than rows 1 and 2.
Type locality: Mould litter and humous soil (pH 6.0) under a Casuarina (Beef-wood) tree
between the town of Erldunda and the Ayers Rock, Australia, about 27° S 132°E.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and
other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective tumidus (swollen) refers to the bulbous oral bulge.
Description: This species was very rare, both at the Australian type locality and at Venezuelan
sites (49) and (61). Thus the morphometric data are very incomplete (Table 31).
Large, in vivo 155–225 × 50–90 µm, usually about 200 × 70 µm, as calculated from some live
measurements and the values in Table 31 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body bursiform to
elongate bursiform, oral region neck-like narrowed, anterior end transverse-truncate, posterior
broadly rounded; slightly flattened in oral region (Fig. 81a, d, i, 82b, c). Macronucleus usually
in central quarters of body, rod-shaped and about 16% shorter than cell, more or less tortuous;

studded with minute nucleoli. Very likely many globular micronuclei attached to macronucleus
and scattered in cytoplasm (Fig. 81a, d, 82a–c). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, with
about 10 excretory pores; defecation vacuole subterminal, contains granular inclusions, about
20 µm across; cytopyge near contractile vacuole, fecal mass slimy and with granular inclusions
mentioned above (Fig. 81a). Mature extrusomes attached to marginal half of oral bulge, rod-
shaped and slightly curved, about 13–15 × 0.5 µm in size (Fig. 81a–c). Cortex colourless and
flexible, bipartite in a granular zone and a viscous layer each about 1 µm thick; contains countless
granules about 1 × 0.5 µm in size, forming about 10 narrowly spaced rows between two kineties
each (Fig. 81a, j, k). Cells brownish at low magnification (≤ 100×), very likely because thick and
studded with rather refractive cortical granules. Cytoplasm studded with granules 1 µm across
and with few to many globular and irregular lipid inclusions 5–20 µm in size (Fig. 81a). Feeds on
middle-sized ciliates, e. g., Gonostomum affine ingested whole (Fig. 82a).
Somatic cilia 8–10 µm long in vivo, arranged in about 37 meridional, ordinarily spaced rows
curved anteriorly. Ciliary rows more or less shortened in posterior pole area; each row comprises
5 to 10 narrowly spaced cilia anteriorly followed by about 100 ordinarily spaced cilia. Dorsal
brush three-rowed and distinctly heterostichad, occupies about 22% of body length, bristles 2–4
253

µm long; rows 1 and 2 of similar length, row 3 strongly shortened but with a monokinetal tail
extending to near body end (Fig. 81a, d, g, 82b, c; Table 31).
Oral bulge rather conspicuous because separated from neck by a flat furrow and 7–10 µm high in
vivo, can open widely when ingesting large prey (Fig. 82a); slightly flattened laterally and thus
elliptic to broadly elliptic in vivo; centre slightly concave, marginal area studded with extrusomes.
Circumoral kinety absent, oral basket thus made of 5–10 oralized somatic monokinetids at begin
of ciliary rows (Fig. 81a, c–e, g, 82b, c; Table 31).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in three soil samples, viz., the Australian type locality
and in Venezuelan samples (49) and (61), showing a wide range from desert soil over bromeliad
mud to rainforest soil.
Remarks: Enchelys tumida resembles Holophrya curvilata sMith, 1897 and Enchelyodon elegans
Kahl, 1930a in size and shape of body and macronucleus. Holophrya curvilata has been described
superficially. sMith (1897) did not describe or illustrate (Fig. 81h) any oral bulge, suggesting that
H. curvilata is a different, probably North American species. Enchelyodon elegans is distinctly
flattened (vs. unflattened), contractile (vs. not contractile), and has about 50 µm (vs. 15 µm) long
extrusomes associated with the oral bulge (Fig. 81l).
According to Kahl (1930a), the genera Enchelys and Enchelyodon are separated by the oral
bulge (absent or inconspicuous vs. conspicuous). The present and other species, e. g., Enchelys
polynucleata (Foissner 1984, Foissner et al. 2002) show that this feature, although often useful,
might guide to the wrong genus because the real feature separating Enchelys and Enchelyodon
is the absence vs. presence of a circumoral kinety. In the former, the oral basket is made of
nematodesmata originating from oralized somatic monokinetids, in the latter it is made from the
circumoral dikinetids.
Renoplites nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Fuscheriidae with comparatively minute, reniform extrusomes and two dorsal brush
rows.
Type species: Renoplites venezuelensis nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun ren (kidney) and the Greek noun hoplites (soldier),
referring to the reniform extrusomes. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Foissner et al. (2002) briefly reviewed this kind of haptorids and classified them
into two families: Fuscheriidae (with enchelyodonid general shape) and Acropisthiidae (with
spathidiid general organization). Renoplites matches the fuscheriid pattern because the ciliary
rows abut on the circumoral kinety at right angles.
Foissner et al. (2002) classified the Fuscheriidae into four genera: Fuscheria, Actinorhabdos,
Diplites, and Dioplitophrya. gabilondo & Foissner (2009) added Fuscheriides and Aciculoplites.
254

All these genera were defined with two main features: the shape of the extrusomes and the number
of dorsal brush rows, i. e., two or three, the later occurring only in Dioplitophrya. Renoplites is
unique in having reniform extrusomes. See Foissner et al. (2002) and gabilondo and Foissner
(2009) for a discussion of generic features.
Renoplites venezuelensis nov. spec. (Fig. 83a, b, d–f, 84a–h; Table 32)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 75 × 25 µm; narrowly ovate. Macronucleus oblong to slightly
reniform; single micronucleus. Extrusomes 1–1.5 µm long. On average 13 bipolar ciliary rows,
2 anteriorly modified to an isomorphic, heterostichad dorsal brush with up to 3 µm long bristles;
brush row 1 with an average of 6 dikinetids, row 2 with 3. Oral bulge discoid to hemispheric.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (25), i. e., highly fertile field (Mahadja) soil from the surroundings
of the village of El Sapo, about 50 km north of Pto. Ayacucho, 67°36’W 5°41’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country (Venezuela) where it was discovered.

d: Mature oral bulge extrusomes, 1–1.5 µm long. g: On superficial observation, D. arenicola from the Namib Desert (Southwest

(rows), BU – oral bulge, CK – circumoral kinety, E – extrusomes, IE – immature (developing) extrusomes, OB – oral basket, OK
– oralized somatic monokinetids. Scale bars 25 µm (e–g) and 35 µm (a).
Description: This species is very variable, as shown by some high coefficients of variation
(Table 32). However, most of the high coefficients can be explained, for instance, the location of
the macronucleus, which is sometimes dislocated by food inclusions (Fig. 84h). Others are more
difficult, especially the high variability of macronucleus length and oral bulge height; for the
later, it is not only the height but also the shape (discoidal to hemispherical), indicating that two
species are mixed or the oral bulge is very sensitive to preparation artifacts.
Size in vivo 60–100 × 15–30 µm, on average 75 × 25 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the protargol-impregnated specimens in Table 32 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage; laterally not flattened. Body narrowly ovate, rarely very narrowly ovate, ovate, or
indistinctly obclavate (Fig. 83a, e, 84a–c; Table 32). Nuclear apparatus in or near body centre,
may be dislocated by large food inclusions (Fig. 83a, e, 84a, b, d, h; Table 32). Macronucleus on
average 15 × 6 µm in protargol preparations, oblong to slightly reniform in 75% of specimens,
rarely ellipsoid or C-shaped; studded with small and middle-sized nucleoli. Micronucleus
attached to macronucleus, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, possibly lacking in half of specimens.

scattered in pharyngeal and somatic plasm, usually impregnate with the protargol method used
(Fig. 83a, b, d, e, 84a, b, e, f, h). Mature oral bulge extrusomes reniform in vivo, some indistinctly
narrowed anteriorly, minute (~ 1–1.5 µm) and thus difficult to recognize. Immature cytoplasmic
extrusomes fine and about 2 µm long. Cortex distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows, ridges right of
rows, contain thick bundles of postciliary microtubule ribbons. Cytoplasm colourless, usually
studded with food vacuoles 5–10 µm across. Feeds on the heterotrophic flagellate Polytoma and
the ciliate Leptopharynx costatus (Fig. 83a, 84c, d, h).
On average 13 ordinarily spaced, bipolar ciliary rows with ordinarily spaced cilia; two rows
anteriorly modified to an inconspicuous, isomorphic and heterostichad dorsal brush with up to 3
µm long bristles: row 1 about twice as long as row 2, on average composed of 6 and 3 dikinetids,
respectively; row 1 commences with a single monokinetid (Fig. 83a, e, f, 84c, e, h; Table 32).
One to three, usually two oralized somatic monokinetids per kinety, often difficult to recognize
(Fig. 83b, e, 84d, f, g).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end, highly variable, i. e., low and flat (discoid) or high and
hemispherical (Fig. 83a, b, 84a, b, d–h; Table 32). Circumoral kinety composed of dikinetids, left
basal body ciliated, right barren but with a rather distinct pharyngeal rod, forming the oral basket
together with the nematodesmata from the oralized somatic monokinetids (Fig. 83a, e, f, 84c, d,
f, g, h).
Notes on ontogenesis: A very late divider showed that shaping of the oral bulge and circumoral
kinety occurs post-divisionally.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in a very fertile soil, where it
was moderately abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish culture for about three weeks.
Remarks: The old literature often does not provide exact data on the extrusomes and dorsal brush,
two main features of the haptorids. We did not find a described ciliate that could be identical with
R. venezuelensis. But there are some similar species, especially from the genus Enchelyodon, for
instance, E. muscicola (Kahl, 1927) Kahl, 1930a, which, however, has “distinct, converging
extrusomes”. This has been confirmed by vuXanoviCi (1959). Enchelyodon californicus Kahl,
1935, a 120–130 µm long moss species, seemingly lacks extrusomes but has highly refractive
granules, likely mucocysts, in the subapical cortex (Fig. 83c). Our species is smaller (up to 100
µm) and lacks such granules but we cannot exclude that Kahl (1927, 1930a) could not see so
minute extrusomes as present in R. venezuelensis. Diplites arenicola (Fig. 83g) from the Namib
Desert is highly similar to R. venezuelensis but has oblong body extrusomes (vs. absent) and
ellipsoid (vs. reniform) oral extrusomes.
This kind of haptorids has very few distinct features and is thus difficult to identify. The best
characters for in vivo identification are the size and shape of the extrusomes and the body.
Clavoplites terrenum (Foissner, 1984) Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002 (Fig.

preparations because of the low abundance. Size in vivo about 70–100 × 25–35 µm, unflattened.
Shape bluntly obclaviform or indistinctly bursiform, depending on nutrition state (Fig. 85a).
Macronucleus elongate reniform. Extrusomes in margin of oral bulge (Fig. 85b), 5–6 × 0.6–1
µm in size, pseudofusiform, i. e., with a quadrangular or slenderly ellipsoid mid, posterior part
of shaft shorter than anterior one; when exploded, about 10–12 × 1 µm (Fig. 85c). Somatic cilia
about 10 µm long, arranged in about 15 rows. Oral bulge about 10 × 5 µm in size.
Comparison with type population: The Venezuelan specimens differ by the number of ciliary
rows (about 15 vs. 22 on average) and the slightly different shape of the extrusomes (cp. Fig. 85c,
h with Fig. 85i). However, extrusome shape is rather variable in this species (see below) and the
number of ciliary rows has been not studied in preparations. Thus, the Venezuelan populations
are considered to fall into the ordinary variability of the species.
Extrusomes of various populations: Over the years, we studied extrusomes from seven populations
(Fig. 85c–i, 86a–i). There is a considerable variability in shape and size. However, one feature
is stable and distinguishes C. terrenum from C. edaphicus and C. australiensis both described
by Foissner et al. (2002): the extrusomes have a central or subcentral convexity, which is at the
anterior or posterior end in the other species. See figure explanations for sites, shape, and size.
Pleuroplites cavicola nov. spec. (Fig. 87a–j, 88a–f; Table 33)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 55 × 37 µm. Theronts slenderly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, trophonts
usually broadly ovate. Macronucleus globular. Extrusomes rod-shaped, about 7 µm long. On
average 23 ciliary rows, about 10 modified to dorsal brush in anterior half.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (57), i. e., moss on stones and soil from the Cueva del Indio, a
small cave near the village of Chichiriviche, north coast of the Morrocoy National Park, 67°13’W
11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and
other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the Latin noun cavum (cave), the thematic vowel
∙i-, and the Latin verb colere (to live in). It refers to the habitat the species was discovered.
Description: Size in vivo 45–65 × 25–45 µm, usually about 55 × 37 µm, as calculated from
some live measurements and the values shown in Table 33 adding 15% preparation shrinkage;
length:width ratio 1.2–2.1:1, body width more variable (CV = 17.2%) than body length (CV =
10.5%) because theronts and trophonts occur (Table 33). Theronts slenderly ellipsoid to ellipsoid
(Fig. 87c, h, 88d, e), rarely obpyriform (Fig. 87d); trophonts ovate to broadly ovate (Fig. 87a, i,
88a–c), rarely ellipsoid (Fig. 88f) or almost globular (Fig. 87e); not flattened laterally. Nuclear
apparatus on average slightly posterior to body centre (Table 33). Macronucleus spheric to slightly
ellipsoid, on average 10.1 × 9.8 µm in protargol preparations (Fig. 87a, c–e, h, i, 88a–f); nucleoli
about 0.5 µm distant from nuclear membrane, numerous, 0.5–2 µm across. Micronucleus attached
to macronucleus, with distinct membrane, 2.5 × 2.2 µm in protargol preparations (Fig. 87a, h, i,

88a, d, f). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end. Extrusome bundle subapical in ventral side,
usually slightly divergent, rarely cylindroid, composed of about 20 rods 6–7 × 0.5–0.7 µm in size
(Fig. 87a–e, h, i, 88a, c, d–f; Table 33); impregnate with the protargol method used, especially the
proximal sixth (Fig. 87h, 88f). Developing extrusomes scattered throughout cytoplasm, cuneate
to acicular, 4–6 µm long (Fig. 87a, h, i, 88a, d). Cortex flexible, in theronts slightly furrowed by
ciliary rows; cortical granules about 0.7 µm across, loosely arranged, inconspicuous (Fig. 87g).
Depending on life cycle, few (early theronts; Fig. 88e) to many (trophonts; Fig. 87a, 88b, c, f)
food vacuoles 3–7 µm across, i. e., comparatively small each containing very likely only a single,
heterotrophic flagellate. Swims rather rapidly, especially the theronts.
Somatic cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 23 meridional to slightly spiral,
ordinarily spaced rows composed of 26 cilia on average; cilia narrower spaced in anterior than
posterior third of rows (Fig. 87a, h–j, 88a–d; Table 33). Ciliary rows bipolar except of three
ventral rows shortened anteriorly at site of extrusome bundle (Fig. 87f, i, 88a, d). About 10 ciliary
rows modified to a heteromorphic dorsal brush in anterior half, composed of single basal bodies

Oral bulge inconspicuous because only about 1 µm high and 6 µm width in protargol preparations;
in frontal view circular with a shallow central concavity caused by the fine internal oral basket
(Fig. 87a, d–f, h, i, 88c–e; Table 33). Circumoral kinety composed of slightly oblique dikinetids
(Fig. 87f, h–j, 88a). Oral basket hardly recognizable in vivo and only faintly impregnated with
protargol, about half as long as body (Fig. 87a, c, i, 88e, f; Table 33); oralized somatic monokinetids
absent or not impregnated.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality where it was abundant in the non-
flooded Petri dish culture three weeks after rewetting the sample.
Remarks: The Pleuroplitidae Foissner, 1996a are unique in having the extrusomes not within the
oral basket, as all other haptorids, but in a subapical, extracytostomal bundle. The family contains
two genera: Pleuroplites Foissner, 1988a (with heteromorphic dorsal brush) and Pleuroplitoides
Foissner, 1996a (with isomorphic dorsal brush). Both genera are monotypic.
The Venezuelan population has a heteromorphic dorsal brush, and thus it belongs to the genus
Pleuroplites. It differs from the Australian, Japanese, and Antarctic populations of P. australis,
described by Foissner (1988a, 1996a, 2000a) and esteban et al. (2000), in the length (~ 7 µm vs.
≤ 3µm) and shape (rod-like vs. narrowly ovate) of the extrusomes and the number of ciliary rows
(on average 23 vs. 14, 15, 14, 18). As concerns the extrusomes, the most important feature of the
new species, which appear highly variable (or due to cryptic species!) in P. australis (Foissner
2000a), they are rod-shaped also in a Kenyan population of P. australis but their length is quite
different (~ 7 µm vs. 3 µm). The limnetic population of P. australis has 17–19 ciliary rows
(esteban et al. 2000) and thus resembles P. cavicola. In contrast, the extrusomes are as minute as
in the other populations and thus clearly different from those of P. cavicola.
Colpodea
The Colpodea were reviewed by Foissner (1993a). He recognized 55 genera with a total of
170 species. Seven new genera and nine new species were described between 1994 and 2001.
In Namibia, we discovered four new genera and 17 new species (Foissner et al. 2002). Three
new genera and five new species were described between 2003 and 2014: Colpoda brasiliensis
Foissner, 2003a; Pseudomaryna australiensis Foissner, 2003a; Platyophrya bromelicola Foissner
& wolF, 2009; Sandmanniella terricola Foissner & stoeCK, 2009; Bromeliothrix metopoides
Foissner, 2010a; and Apocyrtolophosis minor (vuXanoviCi, 1963) Foissner et al., 2014b. Further,
three genera were resurrected (Foissner et al. 2011, 2014b): Tillina, Paracolpoda, and Repoma. In
the present monograph, we describe 7 new colpodean genera and 17 new species; the description
of eight further species is improved. Thus, there are now 80 colpodean genera (45% increase
since 1993) with 218 species (28% increase).
Molecular data, mainly the nuclear small subunit rDNA, are available from 35 genera and 58
species (Foissner et al. 2011, 2014b). They greatly improved our understanding of the colpodean
phylogeny and showed that the core genus, Colpoda, performed an intense adaptive radiation
producing many new genera and species. However, several clades are still paraphyletic or have
poor statistical support, even some of the most complex and characteristic genera, such as
Jaroschia and Kalometopia.

Etymology: The Latinized adjective ephemera (ephemeral) refers to the short periods of activity.
Description: Size in vivo 50–90 × 30–65 µm, usually about 70 × 45 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data adding 5% and 15% preparation shrinkage
for silver nitrate and protargol-impregnated specimens, respectively (Table 34). Body ellipsoid
to broadly ellipsoid, hardly flattened laterally, with distinct concavity at oral opening in anterior
body third, preoral region occasionally slightly rostrate, ovate to broadly ovate when viewed
ventrally or dorsally (Fig. 89a, c, 90a–d, f–h, l, m). Nuclear apparatus usually between first
and second quarter of cell, in rather many specimens dislocated into posterior body half and/or
compressed by a mass of food vacuoles (Fig. 89a, g, 90a, b, e, g; Table 34). Macronucleus and
micronucleus broadly ellipsoidal; macronucleus 12 × 11 µm in protargol preparations, with a
single, lobed nucleolus or several globular nucleoli. Contractile vacuole in posterior end of cell,
excretory pore in or near pole centre, 3–4 µm in diameter (Fig. 89a, c, 90i, l). Cortex flexible and
bright, contains minute (~ 0.5 µm) extrusomes hardly recognizable in vivo but distinct in some
silver nitrate-impregnated specimens, appearing as about 0.5 µm-sized rings and granules when
attached or extruded, respectively (Fig. 89h); usually distinctly bulged by an enormous number
of food vacuoles (Fig. 89a, 90d, f, m). Cytoplasm colourless but dark at low magnification (≤
100×) because studded with lipid droplets 1–3 µm across and compact food vacuoles, except
of clear and thus bright anterior end (Fig. 89a). Food vacuoles covered with a protargol-affine
substance; in two types both containing bacterial rods (Fig. 90p, s), rarely small ciliates such as
Protocyclidium terricola (Fig. 90d, f, g, m): type 1 mainly subcortical, ellipsoid, about 5–8 × 3–4

views (h, i, l), dorsal view (j), and oblique anterior polar view (k) of kinetid (ciliary) and silverline pattern. Arrowheads mark
the excretory pore of the contractile vacuole. There are two to three transverse silverlines between two kinetids each. Thus,
the silverline pattern of C. ephemera is “narrower” than that of C. maupasi which has one to two transverse silverlines (Fig.
91a–e). The dikinetids are very narrowly spaced left of the preoral suture (k) and the excretory pore of the contractile vacuole
(arrowheads) is surrounded by minute polygonal silverline meshes. Note a Protocyclidium terricola in a food vacuole of the
specimen shown in (k). m: In vivo (bright field), C. ephemera has a very characteristic appearance because it is usually so studded
with ordinary and large food vacuoles that the body surface becomes bulged. CR – ciliary row, DI – dikinetid, E – extrusomes,
FV – food vacuoles, OA – oral apparatus, SU – preoral suture. Scale bars 20 µm (j) and 30 µm (h, i, k–m).

µm in size; type 2 scattered throughout cell, globular and up to 20 µm in size frequently bulging
cortex. Swims slowly by rotation about main body axis.
Somatic cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, paired except of dikinetids in posterior quarter of rows
lacking anterior cilium; arranged in 13–19, usually 15 equidistant, moderately spiral, widely
spaced (6–10 µm, on average 8 µm) rows commencing right and left of preoral suture except
for three postoral rows (Fig. 89a–c, f, g, 90a–c, e, h, i, k, l; Table 34). Dikinetids within rows
ordinarily to widely spaced, those in preoral region narrowly spaced right and left of preoral
suture; number of dikinetids/row slightly lower on left (14) than right (16) side of cell; elongated
caudal cilia absent.
Silverline pattern colpodid, usually slightly wrinkled due to the bulging food vacuoles. Two to
three transverse silverlines between two dikinetids each, meshes thus narrowly quadrangular, on
average 34 silverlines between ciliary rows 4 and 5 while 27 between central rows of left side.
Meshes small and polygonal around excretory pore of contractile vacuole (Fig. 89b, c, 90h–l;
Table 34).
Oral apparatus in a distinct concavity of anterior body third (Fig. 89a, b, f, 90a, c–h, m; Table
34). Buccal cavity funnel-shaped, small compared to body size, viz., about 8 µm wide and 10 µm
deep. Right oral polykinetid curved-cuneate, about 8 µm long, composed of three to four kineties
with 3 µm long cilia and a row of dikinetids at dorsal margin (Fig. 90e, f). Left oral polykinetid
quadrangular, rarely elliptic, 4–7 × 2–3 µm in size, composed of an average of nine rows with 4
µm long cilia projecting from body proper but not forming a distinct beard.
Resting cyst: We investigated the resting cysts of specimens from the type locality and from
Idahoe, North America (see Occurrence section). They were highly similar and are thus described
together. The cysts were studied four days after isolation of ordinary specimens from the non-
flooded Petri dish cultures. They did not show any movement of the cytoplasm. However, when
they were slightly pressed with the coverslip, the encysted specimens commenced rotation after
about 1 min, indicating that cilia were still present and the cysts were possibly not mature.
The most conspicuous feature of the cyst of C. ephemera are in both populations a mass of food
vacuoles likely packed with viable bacteria (Fig. 89d, 90p–s), as do the cysts of Pseudomaryna
australiensis Foissner, 2003 and Sandmanniella terricola Foissner & stoeCK, 2009. Otherwise,
the cysts of C. ephemera are highly similar to those of C. maupasi (see micrographs 73q, r in
Foissner 1993a) except for the size which is much larger in C. ephemera (45–58 µm, averages
from two populations) than in C. maupasi (25–30 µm, averages from two populations, see
Foissner 1993a).
Globular, size in type population on average 46.5 µm (M = 45 µm, SD = 5.5, SE = 1.3, CV = 11.8,
Min = 40, Max = 60, n = 17), in North American specimens 58.4 µm (55–60 µm, n = 5). Cyst wall
light brown or yellowish, 2–3 µm thick, composed (from outside to inside, Fig. 89d, 90n, o, q, r)
of an up to 10 µm thick mucous coat colonized by various bacteria and disappearing in old cysts;
ectocyst 1–1.5 µm thick, wrinkled producing a pustulate appearance of the mesocyst; mesocyst
indistinctly separate from ectocyst, about 0.8 µm thick; endocyst close to mesocyst, about 0.6
273

µm thick. Mesocyst and endocyst elastic because becoming smaller when wall is broken (Fig.
90o). Cytoplasm colourless, with many globular and ellipsoid food vacuoles 5–15 µm in size (see
above) and many lipid droplets 0.5–3 µm across. Macronucleus in cyst centre, broadly ellipsoid.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet, we found C. ephemera in the upper 10 cm soil layer of an
active flood plain in the Republic of South Africa (see type locality); in Galápagos sample (68),
i. e., in soil from a mangrove forest at a salinity of 30‰ (!); and in the upper soil layer from a
flood-irrigated grass lawn in Boise, Idahoe, USA (43°38’10.82’’N 116°13’50.5’’W, elev. 813 m;
sample kindly supplied by Dr. Bill Bourland). These habitats are ephemeral, suggesting that C.
ephemera belongs to the ephemeral ciliate community. This is sustained by the curious life cycle
(see next paragraph).
Independent whether C. ephemera is or is not a distinct species (see Remarks), we never met a
C. ephemera-like ciliate in many soil samples from Austria and Germany, suggesting restricted
distribution, especially in Gondwanan areas.
Colpoda ephemera appeared in the three samples one day after rewetting and disappeared on days
two or three, i. e., made resting cysts with food vacuoles. Such behaviour has been described also
in two other colpodids, viz., Pseudomaryna australiensis Foissner, 2003a and Sandmanniella
terricola Foissner & stoeCK, 2009. To put part of growth into the resting cyst may be interpreted
as a pronounced r-selected survival strategy.
Remarks: The most similar species, C. maupasi, has an enormous variability when literature data
and those from Table 34 are compared (for a review, see Foissner 1993a). Part of this variability
might be caused by the preparation methods used, the exactness of the observations and, possibly,
by mixing different species. Thus, we compared C. ephemera with two C. maupasi populations
cultivated (non-flooded Petri dish method), impregnated (Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate), and
analyzed with the same methods (Table 34).
Morphological and ecological comparison: Colpoda maupasi (~ 60 × 30 µm in vivo, 16 ciliary
rows, left oral polykinetid with nine to ten kineties) is a frequent cosmopolitan (Foissner 1993a,
Foissner et al. 2002) and is possibly the ancestor of C. ephemera (~ 70 × 45 µm, cortex bulged by
a mass of ordinary and large food vacuoles, 15 ciliary rows, left oral polykinetid composed of nine
kineties), C. brasiliensis Foissner, 2003 (~ 33 × 18 µm, body covered with a mineral envelope,
12 ciliary rows, left oral polykinetid with five kineties), Apocolpoda africana Foissner, 1993a (~
40 × 25 µm, with curved preoral ridge and kinety, 12 ciliary rows, left oral polykinetid composed
of 14 kineties), Cosmocolpoda naschbergeri Foissner, 1993a (~ 60 × 47 µm, with cortical crests
forming a ladder-like pattern between ciliary rows, 16 ciliary rows, left oral polykinetid with
seven kineties), Idiocolpoda pelobia Foissner, 1993b (~ 35 × 19 µm, oral apparatus on left side
of body, 12 ciliary rows, left oral polykinetid composed of eight kineties), and Dragescozoon
terricola Foissner et al., 2002 (~ 40 × 27 µm, somatic ciliary rows in special preoral pattern, 10
ciliary rows, left oral polykinetid composed of 5 kineties). These species, which have a similar
size and organization, are comparatively rare and look like variants of C. maupasi, for instance,
Cosmocolpoda naschbergeri which has the same “dense” silverline pattern as Colpoda ephemera.
Thus, C. ephemera can be diagnosed only by a combination of morphological and ecological
274

features: life cycle (appears soon after rewetting and disappears after two days while C. maupasi
usually appears when C. ephemera is declining or had disappeared); the enormous number and
size of food vacuoles bulging the cortex (has been never observed in C. maupasi); the resting
cysts which contain food vacuoles with bacteria, as do Pseudomaryna australiensis Foissner,
2003 and Sandmanniella terricola Foissner & stoeCK, 2009; and the biogeographic distribution
(very likely absent from Central Europe where C. maupasi is very frequent).
Morphometric comparison (Table 34, Fig. 91a–e): Most morphometric features of C. ephemera
highly overlap with those of the two very different C. maupasi populations investigated and
with literature data (for a review, see Foissner 1993a); or they appear correlated with body size,
e. g., the interkinetal distance which is distinctly larger in C. ephemera than in C. maupasi,
very likely because C. ephemera is inflated by the high number of food vacuoles. Actually,
there remains only one rather reliable feature, viz., the “dense” silverline pattern which results
from the wide interkinetal distance and a slightly higher number (8 vs. 7 in 20 µm, Table 34)
of transverse silverlines between the kineties (cp. Fig. 89b, c, 90h–l, 91a–e). Statistically, this
is poorly supported but usually there is one transverse silverline between two kinetids in C.
maupasi while two in C. ephemera.
Finally, Colpoda brasiliensis Foissner, 2003a should be mentioned because it looks like a
miniaturized C. ephemera. They differ by body size (about 33 × 18 µm vs. 70 × 45 µm in
vivo), the presence vs. absence of a mineral envelope, the somatic ciliary pattern (kineties 2 and
3 spread vs. not spread anteriorly), and the number of ciliary rows (12 vs. 15 on average) and of
kineties in the left oral polykinetid (5 vs. 9). Thus, these species are easily distinguished both in
vivo and in silver preparations.
Unfortunately, we failed to obtain pure cultures, in contrast to C. maupasi which grows easily.
Further, our effort to separate C. ephemera from C. maupasi by morphometric features failed
either because they are the same species or because of the high variability of C. maupasi. Thus,
we recommend to use the morphological and ecological features, especially the numerous and
extraordinarily large food vacuoles bulging the cortex and the presence of food vacuoles in the
resting cyst.
Paracolpoda lajacola nov. spec. (Fig. 92a–j, 93a–q, 94a–s, 95a–p; Table 35)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 25 × 18 µm, up to 2:1 flattened laterally. Body outline ovate
or semicircular. Nuclear apparatus in posterior ventral quadrant of cell: macronucleus broadly
ellipsoidal and with central nucleolus; micronucleus discoidal, about 4 µm across and 2 µm
thick. Minute granular intrakinetal extrusomes. Usually 12 ciliary rows with an average total of
53 dikinetids: rows 2, 5, 6 complete, right side rows 3 and 4 and all ventral and left side rows
distinctly shortened; last dikinetid of row 2 with two caudal cilia about 15 µm long. Oral apparatus
in anterior third of cell, upper margin with distinct bulge. Left oral polykinetid spatulate, usually
composed of 10 kineties. Resting cysts on average 12 µm across, ectocyst distinctly separate
from endocyst.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (30), i. e., mud from an ephemeral lithotelma (Laja) on granitic

outcroppings between the Agricultural Research Institute and the airport of Pto. Ayacucho,
67°36’W 5°41’N.
Type and voucher slides: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). Additionally, we deposited 4 and 2 slides with protargol and Klein-Foissner silver
nitrate impregnated specimens, respectively. The holotype and other relevant specimens have
been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. At the same locality, we deposited 2 slides with
Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-impregnated P. steinii, used for comparison with P. lajacola (Table
35).
Etymology: The name is a composite of Laja (indigenous name for an ephemeral puddle on
granitic outcroppings) and the Latin verb colere (to live in) referring to the habitat the species
was discovered.
Description: Size in vivo 20–30 × 15–20 µm, usually about 25 × 18 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data adding 5% for preparation shrinkage; values
for protargol-impregnated specimens similar (Table 35); up to 2:1 flattened laterally, right side
flat, left more or less convex (Fig. 92, g, 93h). Body outline broadly elliptical, rarely reniform or
semicircular, preoral region receding, posterior end rounded, rarely bluntly pointed (Fig. 92b–d,
h–j, 93a, e, g, i, 94a, b, n, p). Nuclear apparatus invariably in left posterior quadrant of cell (Fig. 92b,
94a–c, f; Table 35). Macronucleus broadly ellipsoidal, rarely ellipsoidal, about 7 × 5 µm in vivo
and in protargol preparations; nuclear plasm hyaline except for a conspicuous central nucleolus
2–3 µm across and composed of argyrophilic granules. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus,
discoidal, in live about 4 µm across and 2 µm thick, easy to see in vivo because rather refractive.
Contractile vacuole in posterior end of cell, excretory pore in or near pole centre; surrounded by
crystals of various shape and size, most 1.5–2 µm, appear dark at low magnification (≤ 100x)
and bright field illumination (Fig. 92b, e, h, 94s). Cytopyge anterior of excretory pore (Fig. 94s).
Cortex flexible, contains many intrakinetal, protargol-affine granules (likely a sort of mucocysts)
≤ 1 µm across (Fig. 94a–c); granules not recognizable in vivo and in methyl green-pyronin stains,
appear as granules or rings in silver nitrate preparations (Fig. 92j, 94p). Cytoplasm colourless,
contains few to many lipid droplets 1–2 µm in size and 3–5 µm-sized food vacuoles with loose
contents, some with only one bacterial rod (Fig. 92b). Moves moderately fast, swims, glides, and
climbs on microscope slides and soil particles, respectively.
Cilia in vivo about 7 µm long, arranged in 12, rarely in 11 ordinarily to widely spaced, slightly
spiral rows distributed as follows (Fig. 92b, c, e, g–j, 93a–h, j, k, 94e–s; Table 35): rows 2–4 on
right side; rows 5 and 6 on margins of dorsal side; rows 7–9 on left side, 8 and 9 often difficult
to recognize because consisting of only 1–3 dikinetids, one of these rows lacking in specimens
with only 11 rows; rows 10, 11, and 1 postoral on ventral side. Rows 2, 5, and 6 unshortened, the
rest shortened anteriorly (postoral rows) or posteriorly; rows 3 and 4 strongly shortened (but see
Remarks), 3 usually ends slightly posterior of mid-body, 4 usually slightly anterior of mid-body
(Fig. 92c, i, j, 93a–d, 94k–p; Table 35). Dikinetal distances gradually increase from anterior to
posterior, those of row 2 condensed in oral region; total number of dikinetids 44–62, on average
278

53 (Table 35). Two caudal cilia very likely associated with last dikinetid of row 2, about 15 µm
long with filamentous distal half (Fig. 92b, j, 93i).
Silverline pattern colpodid. Meshes of right body side transverse-quadrangular, even in unciliated
areas; those of left side quadrangular or slightly polygonal (Fig. 92e, g–j, 93a–h, 94k–s).
Oral apparatus in anterior third of cell, buccal cavity funnel-shaped, about 7 µm deep, usually
with distinct preoral bulge closing preoral suture (Fig. 92b, c, i; and SEM micrographs of a P.
steinii-like population, Fig. 95i, j, m, o). Right oral polykinetid lunate, composed of about seven
convex rows of 3 µm long cilia, very likely without dikinetal row at dorsal margin. Left oral
polykinetid about 5 × 3 µm in size, spatulate, usually composed of 10 ciliary rows with 6 µm long
cilia forming a distinct beard (Fig. 92a, b, j, 93a, b, i, j, 94e–h; Table 35).
Resting cyst: Resting cysts colourless to yellowish, globular, on average 12.3 × 11.6 µm in size
(M = 12/12, SD = 1.4/1.3, SE = 0.3/0.3, CV = 11.2/10.8, Min = 10/10, Max = 14/14, n = 19).
Wall composed of three distinct layers (Fig. 92f, 93l–q): ectocyst about 0.3 µm thick, slightly to
distinctly yellowish, surface slightly wrinkled and indistinctly pustulate. Endocyst compact and
rather refractive, about 0.5 µm thick, colourless. Between ecto- and endocyst a clear, 1–2 µm wide
zone, possibly the mesocyst. Cytoplasm studded with about 0.5 µm-sized granules covering the
macronucleus and rather many pale globules about 2 µm across, possibly autophagous vacuoles.
Central nucleolus of macronucleus maintained, ciliary rows likely resorbed.
Remarks: The most similar species, P. steinii, has an enormous variability when literature data
are compared (for a review, see Foissner 1993a). Part of this variability might be caused by the
preparation methods used, the exactness of the observations and, possibly, by mixing different
species. Thus, we compared P. lajacola with a P. steinii population cultivated (non-flooded Petri
dish method), impregnated (Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate), and analyzed with the same methods
(Table 35).
Morphological comparison: There is only one species, P. steinii (reviewed in Foissner 1993a),
that strongly resembles P. lajacola, i. e., has a similar body size and nuclear apparatus, 12 somatic
kineties and two elongated caudal cilia, and a spatulate left oral polykinetid. Indeed, there is only
one distinct morphological difference, viz., the preoral bulge which is absent from the described
populations of P. steinii. However, we found a supposed P. steinii population with a distinct
bulge in Austria (Fig. 95i–p). These specimens are also almost fully ciliated, suggesting that they
belong to an undescribed species.
A second feature is the resting cyst which is different from that of P. steinii when compared with
most literature data and Figure 70f in Foissner (1993a) where the wall consists of two tightly
spaced, compact zones while endocyst and ectocyst are separated by a wide space in P. lajacola
(Fig. 93l–q). However, ruthMann & KuCK (1985) described a cyst wall highly similar to that of
P. lajacola in a German population of P. steinii. Unfortunately, the interphase morphology of the
ruthMann population is unknown.
Morphometric comparison (Table 35): Most morphometric features of P. lajacola are very similar
to those of P. steinii, e. g., the number of ciliary rows on body and in the left oral polykinetid as

well as the structure and size of the macronucleus and micronucleus. Actually, we found only three
rather different features, viz., body size, the total number of somatic dikinetids, and the number
of shortened right side kineties. Body size (~ 25 × 18 µm vs. 30 × 19 µm) and length:width ratio
(1.4:1 vs. 1.6:1) are smaller in P. lajacola than in P. steinii, which is corroborated by literature
data (Foissner 1993a). This applies also to distances and sizes correlated with body size, viz.,
distance from anterior body end to nuclear apparatus and to posterior end of ciliary rows, depth
of buccal cavity, and length and width of left oral polykinetid. The number of dikinetids is clearly
different in most ciliary rows, and thus also the total number (53 vs. 89, 68%; Table 35). This
is recognizable also in the literature (Foissner 1993a). Paracolpoda lajacola has kineties 3 and
4 strongly shortened posteriorly while P. steinii has shortened only row 4 (Foissner 1993a).
However, in silver carbonate preparations of P. lajacola, kineties 3 and 4 are less distinctly
shortened than in protargol and silver nitrate preparations (cp. Fig. 93e–h vs. 92b–d, 93k–p).
Thus, the additional kinetids are not ciliated, producing a large barren area on right side (Fig. 94j).
284

Fig. 95i–m. Paracolpoda steinii (?) in the scanning electron microscope. This population, which is from the surroundings of the
village of Hüttschlag in Salzburg, has a distinct preoral bulge and equally long caudal cilia (k), as P. lajacola. Kineties 3 and 4 are
shortened or unshortened (arrowheads; see also Fig. 95o). BU – oral bulge, CC – caudal cilia, EP – excretory pore of contractile
vacuole, LP – left oral polykinetid. Scale bars 10 µm.

same length. o: Right side view of a specimen with unshortened kineties 3 and 4. p: The left side is almost completely ciliated.
The distinct oral bulge and the hardly reduced ciliature suggest this population as an undescribed species. BU – preoral bulge,
CC – caudal cilia, LP – left oral polykinetid, 2, 3 – kineties. Scale bars 10 µm (n) and 20 µm (o, p).
To sum up, P. lajacola and P. steinii differ in the following features: body size (usually about 25
× 18 vs. 30 × 19 µm); the preoral bulge (present vs. usually absent or indistinct); the length of the
individual ciliary rows (most strongly reduced posteriorly vs. some strongly reduced), especially
of kineties 3 (distinctly shortened vs. unshortened) and 4 (ends anterior vs. posterior of mid-
body, Fig. 92c); and the total number of somatic dikinetids (53 vs. 89, Table 35). In spite of these
differences, we cannot exclude that P. lajacola is a variation of P. steinii, which is either highly
variable or is a complex of cryptic species.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., an ephemeral lithotelma.
Emarginatophrya nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Hausmanniellidae with distally emarginated left oral polykinetid.
Type species: Emarginatophrya terricola nov. spec.
Species assignable: Emarginatophrya aspera (Kahl, 1926) nov. comb. (basionym: Colpoda
aspera Kahl, 1926), E. terricola nov. spec.
Etymology: Emarginatophrya is a composite of the Latin adjective emarginatus (shallowly
notched usually at tip) and the Greek noun ophrya (eyebrow ~ cilia ~ ciliate), referring to the
emarginated left oral polykinetid. Feminine gender.
286

Remarks: There are now two species with an emarginated left oral polykinetid: Emarginatophrya
aspera (Fig. 96c, d) and E. terricola (Fig. 96a, b, 97a, b). The first is likely a cosmopolitan while
the second has been found as yet only in Venezuela.
The classification of Emarginatophrya into the Hausmanniellidae is based on Foissner et al.
(2011, 2014b), who assume a fast radiation of Colpoda, several species of which then evolved
independently, forming new species and genera. Possibly, Colpoda elliotti belongs also to this
clade because it unites with E. aspera in trees made of only colpodids s. str. (Foissner et al.
2011). Morphologically, C. elliotti is very similar to E. aspera but its left oral polykinetid is not
emarginated (Foissner 1993a).
Emarginatophrya terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 96a, b, 97a–c; Table 36)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 45 × 28 µm; ellipsoid. Single macronucleus and micronucleus.
On average 19 slightly spiral somatic ciliary rows, kinety 2 with a perioral ciliary condensation.
Right oral polykinetid composed of about 20 kineties, left of an average of 14 kineties of which
4 are emarginated.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (56), i. e., mud and soil from temporary grassland puddles in the
surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, Morrocoy National Park, 67°13’W 11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with a total of 4 protargol-impregnated specimens,
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip, have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the
Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI).

oral polykinetid and the conspicuous emargination in the left polykinetid. The arrow marks the preoral suture; the arrowhead

side overview. CV – contractile vacuole, LP – left oral polykinetid, MA – macronucleus, MI – micronucleus, RP – right oral
polykinetid. Scale bars 15 µm.
Etymology: The Latin species-group name terricola (living in soil) refers to the habitat the
species was discovered.
Description: We found only four specimens in the protargol slides, and we did not recognize the
species in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Thus, in vivo observations are lacking. In spite of
this, we describe this population because (i) it has a clear identity, (ii) the chance is small that this
rare species is refound, and (iii) the preparation is excellent.
Size in vivo about 37–52 × 23–33 µm, on average 45 × 28 µm, when adding 15% preparation
shrinkage (Table 36). Body broadly ellipsoid to indistinctly ovate; unflattened (Fig. 96a, 97a, b).
Nuclear apparatus on average in mid-body (Fig. 96b, 97a, b; Table 36). Macronucleus globular to
broadly ellipsoid, with oblong nucleoli up to 5 µm in size. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus,
globular. Cytoplasm studded with argyrophilic granules 1–2 µm across, especially in posterior
body region (Fig. 97a–c).
Somatic ciliature typical colpodid, i. e., composed of dikinetids forming an average of 19 slightly
spiral rows commencing at preoral suture and postorally; first ciliary row right of oral apparatus
with a perioral ciliary condensation (Fig. 96a, b, 97a–c; Table 36).
Oral apparatus also typical colpodid, i. e., in anterior body half and with two conspicuous
polykinetids (Fig. 96a, 97a, b; Table 36). Right polykinetid composed of about 20 slightly oblique,
short rows dorsally limited by a row of dikinetids. Left polykinetid composed of an average

of 14 comparatively long ciliary rows of which 3–4 are shortened, producing the emarginate
appearance of the organelle (Fig. 96a, 97a, b). Oral cavity large but shallow.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality where it was very rare. As the
sample includes dry mud from the ephemeral ponds, we cannot exclude that E. terricola occurs
also in limnetic and/or semiterrestrial habitats.
Remarks: This is a very distinct species due to the emarginated left oral polykinetid. Nothing
similar has been described before (for a review, see Foissner 1993a).
Apoavestina nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Very small Hausmanniellidae (?) with slightly concave, open oral field and bipartite,
staggered left oral polykinetid. Right oral polykinetid composed of slightly disordered basal
bodies and a row of dikinetids. Pharyngeal fibres extend laterally and anteriorly.
Type species: Apoavestina amazonica nov. spec.
289

Etymology: Composite of apo (derived from) and the generic name Avestina. Feminine gender.
Remarks: Of all members of the order Colpodida, A. amazonica is unique in having a bipartite,
staggered left oral polykinetid. Further, the proximal ribbon of the left polykinetid is unique in
having two distinctly elongated rows of monokinetids (Foissner 1993a, Foissner et al. 2002).
These features are so outstanding that generic separation is natural. There is some similarity with
Bardeliella pulchra in which the long left polykinetid consists of a bryometopid anterior portion
and a colpodid posterior portion, i. e., the polykinetid is bipartite structurally (Foissner et al.
2011).
Family classification of Apoavestina is difficult but we are rather sure that it belongs either to the
Hausmanniellidae, the Colpodidae, or to still undefined families embracing either Paracolpoda
steinii and Bromeliothrix metopoides Foissner, 2010 or → Emarginatophrya aspera, →
Microcolpoda bambicola, and Hausmanniella. This is suggested by morphological similarities
and gene sequence data (Foissner et al. 2011). Paracolpoda steinii, Bromeliothrix metopoides,
and A. amazonica have a similar somatic ciliary pattern, a central nucleolus in the macronucleus,
extrusomes invisible in vivo, and anteriorly extending pharyngeal fibres. → Emarginatophrya
aspera, Hausmanniella discoidea, and A. amazonica have a similar ciliary pattern and, if Avestina
and → Microcolpoda bambicola are included, a flat, open oral field and a minute body size. See
Foissner (1993a) for the genera mentioned.
Apoavestina amazonica nov. spec. (Fig. 98a–h, 99a–i; Table 37)
Diagnosis: On average 25 × 18 µm in vivo. Outline semicircular with slightly sigmoidal or convex
ventral side, preoral suture with 4 distinct teeth. Macronucleus broadly elliptic, about 6 × 4 µm
in vivo, very transparent, with minute central nucleolus. Micronucleus lenticular, compact, about
4 × 2 µm in size. Extrusomes intrakinetal, about 1 µm across, recognizable only in preparations.
On average10 ciliary rows, ciliature anteriorly condensed in kineties 2–4; 2 slightly elongated
caudal cilia. Proximal ribbon of left oral polykinetid composed of 6 kineties, forming a cuneate
pattern due to 2 distinctly elongated distal rows; distal ribbon of polykinetid slightly convex,
composed of 5 rows slightly decreasing in length distally.
Type locality: Soil from the Anavilhanas peninsula in the Rio Negro, vicinity of Ariau lodge,
Manaus, Brazil, 60°W 4°S.
Etymology: Named after the region (Amazon) the species was discovered.
Type slides: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and
other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description: We found merely 13 specimens in 8 protargol slides, and only some were well
impregnated. However, together with the detailed live observations the species could be well
defined.

Size in vivo 22–30 × 15–25 µm, usually about 25 × 18 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 37 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Shape
inconspicuous, i. e., outline roughly semicircular or semielliptic with slightly sigmoidal ventral
side; preoral suture with four distinct teeth (Fig. 98a, b, g, h, 99e–g). Nuclear apparatus usually
posterior to mid-body (Fig. 98a, c, 99c–e, i; Table 37). Macronucleus about 6 × 4 µm in vivo,
remarkable because very transparent and with a minute (~ 1.5 µm) central nucleolus, easily
dislocated under slight coverslip pressure (Fig. 99c, d); often strongly distorted in protargol
preparations being ellipsoid and wrinkled in 9 out of 13 specimens analysed; nucleoplasm with a
diffuse reticulum. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, comparatively large, viz., 4 × 2 µm and
compact, thus more easily recognized than the macronucleus in vivo; lenticular, side attached to
macronucleus slightly flattened; does not impregnate with the protargol method used. Contractile
vacuole in posterior body end, excretory pore in pole centre (Fig. 98a, 99d). Extrusomes, likely
a special kind of mucocysts, invisible in vivo but distinct in protargol preparations disturbing
analysis of ciliary pattern; most within ciliary rows, discoidal with a diameter of about 1 µm
(Fig. 99f); highly similar to those of Paracolpoda steinii and Bromeliothrix metopoides (Foissner
1993a, 2010a). Cytoplasm colourless, well-fed specimens dark at low magnification (× 100)
because studded with food vacuoles 2–4 µm across; some minute crystals around contractile
vacuole and some small lipid droplets scattered throughout plasm (Fig. 98a, 99a–d). Cytopyge
not observed but fecal remnants frequently adhere to posterior pole area in well-fed specimens
(Fig. 98g, h). Feeds on bacteria. Glides rapidly to and fro on microscope slide.

µm (b, c) and 15 µm (a).
Cilia in vivo about 10 µm long and thus almost half of body length, with a rather long and fine
distal portion, usually arranged in 10 equidistant rows of which three to four originate postorally,
last kinetid of kinety 2 with two slightly elongated caudal cilia; both the long somatic cilia and
the caudal cilia confirmed in protargol preparations (Fig. 98a–c, 99a, e; Table 37). Kineties in
typical Colpoda pattern, densely ciliated anteriorly, especially rows 2 to 4 having ciliated both
basal bodies of the dikinetids throughout; postoral kineties and posterior half of left side kineties
have ciliated only the posterior basal bodies; distances between kinetids gradually and distinctly
increasing from anterior to posterior in all kineties Fig. 98b, c, 99a, b, e). Distinct, oblique fibres,
very likely transverse microtubule ribbons, originate from anterior kinetids of kinety 4 (Fig. 98b,
99e).
Oral apparatus in middle third of cell and usually left of body´s midline, forming a roughly
circular pattern about 5–7 µm across. Oral field without lip and thus open, slightly concave
(Fig. 98a, b, 99a, b, e; Table 37). Cilia of polykinetids about 4 µm long in vivo. Right oral
polykinetid narrow, colpodid according to careful live observations, i. e., composed of a row of
dikinetids dorsally and of slightly disordered rows of monokinetids ventrally (Fig. 98e). Left
oral polykinetid composed of two staggered ribbons: proximal ribbon within trough of oral field,
distal ribbon on its margin and ahead of proximal one. Proximal ribbon invariably composed of

six rows of monokinetids: kineties 1–4 slightly and gradually increase in length from proximal
to distal, kineties 5 and 6 distinctly elongated and slightly convex; distal ribbon slightly convex
and invariably composed of five kineties decreasing in length from proximal to distal (Fig. 98a,
b, f, 99a, b, e, h, i; Table 37). Pharyngeal fibres commencing in or near centre of oral cavity, first
extend horizontally and then anteriorly, as in Paracolpoda steinii and Bromeliothrix metopoides
(Fig. 98b; Foissner 1993a, 2010a).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in a seasonally flooded rainforest
on a peninsula of the Rio Negro, just before it merges with the Rio Solimoes to become the great
Amazon River. The sample consisted of about 50% leaf litter mixed with soil and fine roots from
the root carpet extending in 5–7 cm soil depth. Soil brownish, crumbly, pH 5.1 in water.
293

Apoavestina amazonica and many other ciliate species were present already 48 h after rewetting
the air-dried sample. The entire soil percolate from the non-flooded Petri dish culture was used
for preparations; then the percolate was replaced by tap water. Apoavestina amazonica did not
reappear, although many other species did and some new ones developed. Thus, A. amazonica
is possibly an r-selected species. Further investigations are required to find out whether A.
amazonica is a local or Gondwanan endemic.
Remarks: We did not find a described species that could be identical with A. amazonica. This
species is so minute that live identification is very difficult, especially because it superficially
resembles rather many small colpodeans, for instance, Colpoda ecaudata, → Emarginatophrya
aspera, Paracolpoda steinii, Avestina ludwigi, Orthokreyella schiffmanni, Kreyella muscicola,
Microdiaphanosoma terricola, and Pseudokreyella spp. (see Foissner 1993a for description of
species). Thus, the identification should be checked in silver preparations.
Microcolpoda nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Minute, Hausmanniella-like ciliates with ventrolateral oral apparatus in anterior half
of body. Somatic ciliary rows 2 and 3 very densely ciliated in anterior half, curve semicircularly
around anterior margin of oral apparatus. Oral field moderately concave and open (without roof),
ciliature thus exposed; right oral ciliary field composed of a single row of dikinetids, left of a
typical polykinetid extending transversely to main body axis; with a long, basket-like pharynx
commencing at right margin of oral ciliature. Silverline pattern colpodid.
Type species: Microcolpoda bambicola nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek adjective mikrós (small) and the generic name Colpoda
(bosom-shaped). Feminine gender.
Remarks: This minute ciliate is difficult to classify but likely more closely related to the
Colpodina than to any other higher colpodean taxon. Within the Colpodina, M. bambicola
resembles the Hausmanniellidae in having the mouth located ventro-laterally while it is on the
right side in Avestina, a supposed hausmanniellid (Foissner 1993a). Further, Avestina spp. have
the left oral polykinetid oriented obliquely to the main body axis while that of M. bambicola
extends transversely, as in most small Colpoda species. Very likely, Microcolpoda and Avestina
are closely related.
The phylogenetic position of Microcolpoda is difficult to find because it has a main feature each
from the Hausmanniellidae (general organization, see Foissner 1993a) and the Sandmanniellidae
Foissner & stoeCK, 2009 (a basket-like pharynx; see also → Sandmannides venezuelensis).
The molecular analysis (dunthorn et al. 2012, as Kreyella-like undesc. gen. & sp.) supports
a hausmanniellid relationship because Microcolpoda forms a cluster with Hausmanniella
discoidea and the minute → Emarginatophrya aspera. Thus, an oral basket-like pharynx is
possibly plesiomorphic and remained in at least five groups: Sandmanniella, → Sandmannides,
Microcolpoda, Notoxoma, and Pseudochlamydonella (for genera see → Sandmannides and
Foissner 1993a).
294

Microcolpoda bambicola nov. spec. (Fig. 100a–l, 101a–l; Table 38)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 20 × 15 µm. Body outline semicircular to broadly reniform. Macro-
and micronucleus globular. On average 11 somatic ciliary rows extending slightly spirally. Left
oral polykinetid narrow, composed of an average of 9 ciliary rows.
Type locality: Mud from a bamboo stump along the Bowden Hill Road to the Hermitage dam,
north of the town of Kingston, Jamaica, 79°46’W 18°5’N.
Type material: 1 holotype slide and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens,
6 paratype slides with Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-prepared cells, and 2 paratype slides with
Klein-Foissner silver nitrate-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have
been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the generic name Bambus, the thematic vowel i, and the Latin verb
colere (to live in), referring to the habitat the species was discovered.

Resting cyst with wall marked by opposed arrowheads. K2 – somatic kinety 2, MA – macronucleus, LP – left oral polykinetid,

Description: Size in vivo 16–25 × 12–18 µm, usually about 20 × 15 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-impregnated specimens adding
5% preparation shrinkage (Table 38). Protargol-impregnated specimens considerably smaller
because fixed with alcohol-formalin and thus shrunken by about 20% (Table 38). Body outline
semicircular (Fig. 100a, b, 101a, b), usually slightly narrowed posteriorly (Fig. 100a, j), rarely
anteriorly; in vivo indistinctly flattened laterally, slightly convex on right side, strongly on left
(Fig. 100i, 101j, k). Swimming specimens broadly reniform caused by concave oral field (Fig.
100c, l). Nuclear apparatus in or slightly posterior of mid-body (Fig. 100a, k, l, 101a–g; Table
38). Macronucleus globular, rarely very broadly ellipsoid; with few, comparatively large nucleoli
(Fig. 100a, 101c). Micronucleus as macronucleus, very likely not in perinuclear space because
simply attached to macronucleus (Fig. 100a, k, l, 101d, g). Contractile vacuole and excretory
pore in or near centre of posterior pole, rather prominent in protargol preparations; surrounded by
highly refractive crystals of various shape and 1–2 µm in size, likely originate from prey because
present also in food vacuoles (Fig. 100a, h, k, l, 101a, b, i). Cortex flexible, contains intrakinetal
granules about 0.3 µm in size, very likely a sort of mucocysts (Fig. 100e). Cytoplasm colourless,
densely granulated by pale globules about 1 µm across, contains some crystals described above
and food vacuoles with loose contents, likely bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates (Fig. 100a,
101a, b). Swims rather rapidly rotating about main body axis, glides on microscope slides and
mud accumulations.
Somatic cilia paired, in vivo about 6 µm long, anterior cilium lacking in dikinetids of left posterior
half of cell, arranged in 10–12 slightly spiral rows more narrowly spaced on right than left side,
especially rows 2 and 3 having dikinetids so narrowly spaced in semicircular anterior half that a
zigzag pattern is produced; intrakinetal distances of left side about twice as wide as those in right
side row 3, right side thus much more ciliated than left; preoral suture very narrow; elongated
caudal cilia absent (Fig. 100a, d, h–l, 101c–i; Table 38).
298

Silverline pattern wide-meshed, typical colpodid, indistinguishable from that of other small
colpodids s.str. (Fig. 100d, 101h, i).
Oral apparatus ventrolateral in second quarter of body, structures exposed because not roofed
over by a buccal lip (Fig. 100a, j, l, 101a, b, d, e, g, h; Table 38). Oral field about 5 µm across in
vivo, moderately concave, contains three important structures (Fig. 100a, d, h–j, l, 101b–e, g, h;
Table 38): (i) a right ciliary field very likely composed of a row of dikinetids with 2–3 µm long
cilia, a third row possibly occurs in posterior half of some specimens (Fig. 100h, 101c); (ii) a left
polykinetid extending transversely from right margin of oral field to ventral side, about 5 × 1 µm
in size, composed of an average of nine monokinetal rows with about 6 µm long cilia; and (iii)
an oral basket-like pharynx commencing near proximal end of left polykinetid and extending to
dorsal side of body (Fig. 100d, h–j, l, 101j, k).
Resting cyst: Resting cysts globular and colourless, without mucous coat, in vivo 12.4 µm across
on average (M = 12 µm, SD = 1.5, SE = 0.4, CV = 12.1, Min = 11, Max = 16, n = 15). Cyst wall
composed of two tightly spaced layers 0.7–1 µm thick together (Fig. 100f, g, 101l). Cytoplasm
with some lipid droplets 0.5–1 µm in diameter; macronucleus in cyst centre, about 5 µm across.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. A raw culture was obtained from the
wet bamboo mud, tap water and some squashed wheat grains.
Remarks: Microcolpoda bambicola belongs to the very small colpodeans having a body
length of 10–30 µm (Foissner 1993a). There are rather many of such species, all reviewed in
Foissner (1993a). In vivo, body size and shape of M. bambicola resemble Colpoda ecaudata, →
Emarginatophrya aspera and → Paracolpoda spp. (mouth on ventral side, without perioral ciliary
condensations); Pseudoplatyophrya spp. and Nivaliella plana (with minute, subapical feeding
tube); Apocyrtolophosis minor (without perioral ciliary condensations); Microdiaphanosoma
arcuatum, Orthokreyella schiffmanni, and Kreyella minuta (left side ciliated only along anterior
margin).
Krassniggia auxiliaris Foissner, 1987a (Fig. 102a–k)
This conspicuous ciliate, which belongs to the Colpodidae, occurred in sample (2) from Venezuela
and matches very well the original description (for a review, see Foissner 1993a). Thus, we
provide only a few micrographs and deposit four slides with silver nitrate-impregnated specimens
in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). As yet, this species has been
recorded only from Gondwanan localities: Kenya (Africa), Australia, and now South America.
The overall appearance of K. auxiliaries is rather similar to another gigantic colpodid, Bresslauides
discoideus, as described by Foissner (1993a). However, this species has different oral structures
and thus belongs to the Hausmanniellidae.

Grossglockneria lajacola nov. spec. (Fig. 103a, b, 104a–d)
Diagnosis: As G. acuta but with a 15–20 µm long caudal cilium.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (32), i. e., ephemeral puddles (Lajas) on granitic outgroppings
between the Agricultural Research Institute and the airport of Pto. Ayacucho, 68°W 6°N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with a total of 4 protargol-impregnated specimens
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of Laja (native term for ephemeral puddles on
granitic outcroppings) and the Latin verb colere (to live in), the habitat G. lajacola was discovered.
Description: This species was very rare. We found only five poorly impregnated cells in
the protargol slides (Fig. 104a–d). Thus, we cannot provide morphometric data and base the
description mainly on the live observations. The identity of the species is very clear due to the
unique caudal cilium. Nonetheless, the species needs a more detailed investigation also with
respect to the micronucleus and the number of ciliary rows.

resembles a “typical” G. acuta. E – extrusomes, MA – macronucleus. Scale bars 20 µm.
Size in vivo 30–50 × 10–20 µm, usually about 40 × 15 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the five prepared specimens adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Slenderly
ovate (Fig. 103a), slenderly ellipsoid (Fig. 104a–c) or ellipsoid (Fig. 104d); anterior end bluntly
pointed, posterior slightly narrowed and rounded. Macronucleus slightly anterior or posterior
of mid-body, broadly ellipsoid, 6–10 × 4–6 µm in vivo; frequently with an enlarged, central
nucleolus surrounded by several small nucleoli 1–2 µm across (Fig. 103a, 104a–d). Micronucleus
not studied and not impregnated. Contractile vacuole in posterior end, with tubular excretory
pore close to caudal cilium. Cortex colourless, very flexible, distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows;
contains minute (~ 0.4 µm) extrusomes mainly around dikinetids, swollen to 1–2 µm-sized,
deeply impregnating structures in protargol preparations as in G. acuta (Fig. 103b, 104a, b).
Cytoplasm hyaline, contains many minute (~ 0.5 µm) crystals sparkling under interference
contrast illumination and globular food droplets 1–3 µm across, usually about 2 µm. Swims
rather rapidly, never rests.
Nine or 10 ciliary rows extend spirally from anterior to posterior end of cell (Fig. 103a, 104a,b).
Cilia 7–8 µm long in vivo, paired except for left posterior region covered with single cilia. In
or near centre of posterior pole a dikinetid with an ordinary anterior cilium and an elongated
posterior cilium 15–20 µm long in vivo; distal half of caudal cilium difficult to recognize because
very fine and strongly beating (Fig. 103a).
303

Oral apparatus grossglockneriid, i. e., subapical and small. Feeding tube about 2 µm long in vivo
(Fig. 103a, 104a–d). Cilia of paroral membrane and adoral polykinetid about 2.5 µm long in vivo
(Fig. 103a).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, a special habitat to which it is
probably restricted.
Remarks: This species, which we supposed to be a small Grossglockneria acuta (Fig. 103c),
came to our attention by the rather small size and the hyaline cytoplasm. First, we recognized a
rather large central nucleolus in the macronucleus and then we saw the elongated caudal cilium,
showing that it was an undescribed species.
Three Grossglockneria species have been described: G. acuta Foissner, 1980a (Fig. 103c); G.
hyalina Foissner, 1985 (Fig. 103d); and G. ovata Foissner, 1999a. None has an elongated caudal
cilium. All other features are highly similar to G. acuta.
In vivo, G. lajacola is easily confused with G. acuta (without caudal cilium) and Trihymena
terricola Foissner, 1988a (with minute but distinct adoral polykinetids; see Foissner 1993a). The
great similarity of G. lajacola and G. acuta requires that in future all G. acuta-like populations
are checked for the absence of a caudal cilium!
Pseudoplatyophrya isabelae nov. spec. (Fig. 105a–d, 106a–d; Table 39)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 23 × 15 µm. Body outline elliptic or oval, anterior end obliquely
truncate in ~ 1/3 of specimens. Macronucleus globular, micronucleus ellipsoid. Minute extrusomes
within ciliary rows. 9 somatic kineties with a total of about 40 dikinetids: kinety 1 extends
postorally, composed of an average of five dikinetids, last dikinetid associated with an elongated
caudal cilium; kinety 2 extends to or slightly posterior to mid-body, usually composed of three
widely spaced dikinetids; kinety 3 extends in anterior body half and curves around anterior
body end, usually composed of five or six dikinetids. Oral apparatus grossglockneriid, adoral
polykinetid minute.
Type locality: Galápagos sample (68), i. e., highly saline (~ 30‰) soil and tree bark from a
mangrove forest near the village of Puerto Villamil, south coast of Isabela Island, 0°57’S 90°57’W.
Type material: 1 holotype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens has been deposited in
the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the island it was discovered, i. e., Isabela Island of the Galápagos
archipelago.
Description: In vivo, we misidentified this species as P. nana. Thus, we did not study it in detail
and cannot provide live observations (see also → P. galapagensis).
Size in vivo 20–27 × 11–17 µm, usually about 23 × 15 µm when 15% preparation shrinkage are
added to values shown in Table 39. Body outline roughly elliptic (Fig. 105a, 106a, c) or ovate (Fig.

105c, 106d), anterior end slightly oblique in about 1/3 of specimens (Fig. 105a, 106a, c); slightly
to distinctly (~ 2:1) flattened laterally. Nuclear apparatus in or posterior to mid-body on average
(Fig. 105b, d, 106b–d; Table 39). Macronucleus globular to broadly ellipsoid, about 5 µm across
in protargol preparations. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid
(3:1), possibly slightly flattened (Fig. 105b, 106b, c). Contractile vacuole not recognizable in the
preparations, very likely in posterior end studded with deeply impregnating granular material,
possibly fecal mass (Fig. 105b, d, 106a–d). Within ciliary rows minute (< 0.5 µm) argyrophilic
granules, very likely extrusomes of the mucocyst type. Food vacuoles impregnate lightly, up to
5 µm in size.
Ordinary somatic cilia 6–7 µm long, caudal cilium 11–14 µm in protargol preparations; arranged
in nine meridional, ordinarily spaced rows commencing apically and ending at different length of
body, distance between rows 2 and 3 distinctly increased; anterior basal body of dikinetids usually
barren in posterior half of left side (Fig. 105a–d, 106a–d; Table 39). Ciliary row 1 on ventral side,
usually composed of five dikinetids, last dikinetid associated with an ordinary cilium anteriorly
and an elongated caudal cilium posteriorly (for numbering of rows, see Fig. 105a, b and 106a, b,
d); row 2 on right side of cell, composed of three dikinetids, ends slightly posterior to mid-body;
row 3 on right side of cell, usually composed of six dikinetids, curves around anterior body end
and terminates in or near mid-body; row 4 on right side of cell, composed of five to six dikinetids,
extends to last third of body; row 5 on dorsal side of body, composed of about eight dikinetids,

extends whole body length; row 6 on left side of body, composed of 5–7 dikinetids, extends to
last third of cell; rows 7 and 8 on left side of body, usually composed of two dikinetids each,
extend to second third of body; row 9 on ventral side, usually composed of three dikinetids, ends
in or slightly anterior to mid-body. In total about 40 dikinetids (Fig. 105a–d, 106a–d; Table 39).
Oral apparatus grossglockneriid, i. e., minute and slightly subapical; cilia only 2.5–3 µm long
in protargol preparations. Paroral membrane moderately curved, likely composed of dikinetids.
Adoral polykinetid close posterior to feeding tube, likely composed of three kineties with three
cilia each. Feeding tube about 2 µm long and about 1 µm across at distal end. Pharyngeal fibres
extend vertically to mid-body (Fig. 105a, c, 106a, c; Table 39).
Occurrence and ecology: See → P. galapagensis!
Remarks: As explained in → P. galapagensis, these minute ciliates are difficult to study, even
when the protargol preparations are excellent. Thus, misinterpretations cannot be excluded, for
instance, the caudal cilium is possibly associated with kinety 2, not with kinety 1 as described
above.

Pseudoplatyophrya isabelae differs from → P. galapagensis mainly by somatic kinety 2, which
is composed of three (vs. one) dikinetids. Further, it is slightly broader (length:width ratio 1.9 vs.
1.6) and larger in most features, for instance, the total number of dikinetids (~ 40 vs. ~ 30) and the
number of dikinetids composing kinety 4 (five vs. four). The main feature, viz., kinety 2, appears

not impressive but its invariability might justify a distinct species. For the species mentioned in
the next paragraph, see Foissner (1993a).
Pseudoplatyophrya nana differs from P. isabelae by the shape of the micronucleus (~ 5 µm
across and strongly flattened vs. ~ 3 µm and only slightly flattened), the number of dikinetids in
row 2 (~ eight vs. three), and the total number of somatic dikinetids (usually ~ 60 vs. ~ 40; Fig.
106f–j). Pseudoplatyophrya saltans differs from P. isabelae by the shape of the micronucleus
(distinctly vs. slightly flattened), the body size (< 20 µm vs. > 20 µm), the higher number of
dikinetids in rows 7 and 8 (≥ five vs. two), and, very likely, it does not jump (vs. sudden jumps in
P. saltans). Nivaliella plana differs from P. isabelae by the shape of the micronucleus (distinctly
vs. slightly flattened), the number of dikinetids in ciliary rows 3 and 4 (≤ three vs. ≥ five), and the
total number of dikinetids (25–30 vs. 40; see also Foissner et al. 2002).
Pseudoplatyophrya galapagensis nov. spec. (Fig. 107a–d, 108a–e; Table 39)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 22 × 12 µm. Body ellipsoid to quadrangular with rounded corners,
anterior end usually slightly obliquely truncate. Macronucleus and micronucleus broadly
ellipsoid. 9 somatic kineties with a total of about 30 dikinetids: kinety 1 extends postorally, usually
composed of four dikinetids, last dikinetid associated with an elongated caudal cilium; kinety 2
composed of only one dikinetid slightly right and posterior of oral apparatus; kinety 3 extends
in anterior quarter of body, usually composed of two dikinetids; kinety 5 extends whole body
length and curves around anterior body end, composed of about nine dikinetids. Oral apparatus
grossglockneriid, adoral polykinetid minute.
Type locality: Galápagos sample (68), i. e., highly saline (~ 30‰) soil and tree bark from a
mangrove forest near the village of Puerto Villamil, south coast of Isabela Island, 0°57’S 90°57’W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens
have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country it was discovered, i. e., the Galápagos archipelago.
Description (see Remarks for the in vivo aspect): Size in vivo 20–25 × 10–15 µm, usually
about 22 × 12 µm when 15% preparation shrinkage are added to the values shown in Table
39. Body shape highly dependent on amount of food ingested, i. e., quadrangular with rounded
ends and leaf-like flattened when starving (Fig. 107d, 108c, d) while ellipsoid when moderately
filled with food droplets (Fig. 107a, c, 108a); anterior body end usually slightly oblique. Nuclear
apparatus in mid-body on average, macronucleus and micronucleus broadly ellipsoid on average,
micronucleus only faintly impregnated (Fig. 107b, 108a–e; Table 39). Contractile vacuole not
recognizable in the preparations, very likely in rear end usually studded with deeply impregnating
granules, possibly fecal mass (Fig. 107b, c, 108a–c). Extrusomes not recognizable in protargol
preparations. Cytoplasm colourless, studded with 2–10 µm-sized food droplets in ellipsoid
specimens, rare in starving quadrangular cells.

Ordinary somatic cilia 5–6 µm long in protargol preparations, caudal cilium about half of body
length; arranged in nine meridional, ordinarily spaced rows commencing apically and ending at
different length of body, distance between rows 2 and 3 distinctly increased; anterior basal body
of left side dikinetids barren in posterior dikinetids (Fig. 107a–d, 108a–e; Table 39). Ciliary row
1 on ventral side, usually composed of four dikinetids, last dikinetid associated with an ordinary
cilium anteriorly and an elongated caudal cilium posteriorly (for numbering of rows, see Fig.
107c, 108a, b); row 2 on right side of cell, composed of one, very rarely two dikinetids slightly
right and posterior of oral apparatus; row 3 extends in anterior quarter of body, usually composed
of two dikinetids; row 4 on right side of cell, extends to mid-body, composed of an average
of four dikinetids; row 5 on dorsal side of cell, extends whole body length and curves around
anterior body end, composed of about nine dikinetids; row 6 on left side of cell, extends to mid-
body, usually composed of four dikinetids; rows 7 and 8 on left side of cell, each composed of
only two dikinetids and thus ending in anterior third of body; row 9 on ventral side, extends
to mid-body, usually composed of three dikinetids. In total about 30 dikinetids (Fig. 107a–d,
108a–e; Table 39).
Oral apparatus grossglockneriid, i. e., minute and slightly subapical; cilia up to 3 µm long

after protargol impregnation. Paroral membrane moderately curved, very likely composed of
dikinetids. Adoral polykinetid close posterior to feeding tube, likely composed of three kineties
with three cilia each. Feeding tube 1.5–2 µm long and about 1 µm across at distal end. Pharyngeal
fibres extend vertically to mid-body (Fig. 107a, c, 108a, c, d; Table 39).

Occurrence and ecology: Pseudoplatyophrya galapagensis and → P. isabelae occurred in
the non-flooded Petri dish culture of the same sample but sequentially and each for a few days
only. Both were very rare, possibly due to the high salt concentration (30‰). Basically, both are
candidates for Galápagense or neotropic endemics. However, the in vivo misidentification shows
that the species might have a broader, as yet unrecognized distribution. See also next paragraph.
Remarks: Pseudoplatyophrya galapagensis and → P. isabelae were discovered in a highly saline
(~ 30‰) soil and bark sample from a mangrove forest on the Galápagos archipelago. They did
not appear at the same time but sequentially in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Both were
rare and were in vivo misidentified as P. nana Foissner, 1980a with which they have a lot in
common, especially body shape and size and the elongated caudal cilium. However, the protargol
preparations showed a different ciliary pattern and a stouter micronucleus. The misidentification
caused that we did not study the live aspect in detail. In spite of this, we describe these species
because they have a clear identity and the in vivo aspect was at least checked.
Ciliates of this small size and with strongly reduced ciliature are difficult to observe even when
the protargol preparations are excellent. Thus, some interpretation mistakes cannot be excluded,
for instance, ciliary row 4, not row 5 might curve around the anterior body end in P. galapagensis
and the caudal cilium might be associated with kinety 2, not kinety 1 in both species.
See → P. isabelae for distinguishing it from P. galapagensis. From the other congeners, viz., P.
nana (Fig. 108f–j), P. saltans, and P. terricola, all reviewed in Foissner (1993a), P. galapagensis
differs mainly by the number of dikinetids in kinety 2 (one vs. ≥ three). The most similar species
is Nivaliella plana, also reviewed in Foissner (1993a) and Foissner et al. (2002), which, however,
has 10 (vs. 9) ciliary rows, possesses at least two (vs. one) dikinetids in kinety 2, and is usually
broader (length:width ratio 1.5:1 in two populations vs. 1.9:1; see Table 39, Foissner 1993a, and
Foissner et al. 2002).
The generic classification of P. galapagensis and → P. isabelae is uncertain, i. e., they could
belong to Nivaliella due to the strongly reduced, hardly spiralling ciliature while body shape
(length:width ratio) match Pseudoplatyophrya (see above).
Pseudoplatyophrya spinosa nov. spec. (Fig. 109a–l, 110a–m; Table 40)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 30 × 20 µm. Ellipsoid or slightly ovate, with complex cortical
ridges producing two ventral spines; posteriorly, a tubular process containing an ellipsoid granule.
Macronucleus globular, micronucleus discoidal and up to 4 µm across. Minute extrusomes within
ciliary rows. 10 somatic kineties with a total of about 34 dikinetids: kinety 1 extends postorally,
composed of two dikinetids; kinety 2 extends right of oral apparatus, usually composed of three
widely spaced dikinetids, last dikinetid with a caudal cilium almost as long as body; kinety 3
composed of one dikinetid; kineties 5–7 bipolar; kineties 8–10 strongly shortened extending in
anterior half of body. Oral apparatus grossglockneriid, adoral polykinetid minute.
Type locality: Brazil, i. e., litter and soil from the rain forest around the Ariau Lodge on the
Anavilhanas archipelago about 40 km west of the town of Manaus, 60°W 4°S.

Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective spinosa (spiny, thorny) refers to the spinous body.
Description: Pseudoplatyophrya spinosa has three processes of which those in mid-body are
true “spines” related to cortex ridges. The tubular posterior process contains an ellipsoid granule
resembling microsporidian cysts. We call this the “posterior appendage”.

Pseudoplatyophrya spinosa is moderately variable in most important features (CV ≤ 15%; Table
40) except of spine height (CV = 25.5%), the length of the posterior appendage (CV = 21%), and
the number of kinetids in the “difficult” kineties 9 and 10 (CV = 30–40%).
Size in vivo 25–40 × 15–25 µm, usually about 30 × 20 µm with posterior appendage, as calculated
from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 40 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage. Body ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid with a length:width ratio of up to 1.7:1; rarely
slightly ovate; laterally flattened up to 3:1. Anterior body end slightly to distinctly obliquely
truncate, gradually narrowed to posterior appendage (Fig. 109a–l, 110a–m). Nuclear apparatus
slightly anterior to mid-body on average (Fig. 109a, f, i, j, l, 110a, f, k, m; Table 40). Macronucleus
globular to broadly ellipsoid, on average 5 × 4 µm in protargol preparations, with about five
peripheral nucleoli 1–3 µm in size. Micronucleus in vivo about 3–4 × 1–2 µm, i. e., discoidal and
comparably large as in P. nana (Foissner 1993a), stains blue with methyl green-pyronin but very
rarely impregnates and distinctly shrinks in protargol preparations (Fig. 109l, 110k). Contractile
vacuole in rear body end, i. e., anterior to posterior appendage, surrounded by sparkling crystals
≤ 1 µm in size. Minute (≤ 0.5 µm) cortical granules, very likely extrusomes of the mucocyst type,
recognizable in protargol preparations, usually one granule anterior and posterior to dikinetids
315

(Fig. 109c, 110l, m). Cytoplasm colourless, usually packed with globular, rarely irregular, bright
inclusions 0.5–3 µm in size, i. e., the contents of fungal hyphae and/or spores; inclusions of
different protargol affinity, very likely depending on stage of digestion; contains also many
sparkling crystals 0.5–1 µm in size (Fig. 109a, 110a, c–l). Glides rather rapidly on microscope
slide and soil particles.
Cortex about 1 µm thick, glossy, supported by a complex ridge pattern forming two small
ventrolateral spines in and slightly posterior to mid-body; anterior spine usually smaller than
posterior; ridge height increases posteriorly. Ridge pattern rather variable but middle third of right
side usually occupied by a faceted area in posterior half (Fig. 109a–d, 110c, d–f, h, m). Posterior
appendage conspicuous in vivo and in protargol preparations because about 5 µm long and so
deeply impregnated that the distal granule becomes indiscernible; tubular distal region occupied
by an ellipsoid or broadly ovate granule 1–2 µm in size and occasionally with a rather bright area
in anterior half; two such appendages in three out of 27 specimens investigated (Fig. 109a–d, e,
g, h, k, 110a, c–e, g, h, m; Table 40).
Cilia in vivo about 10 µm long in upper thirds of body, about 13 µm in posterior third; caudal
cilium about as long as body, distal third very fine; arranged in 10 rows of which rows 2, 5, 6, and
7 are bipolar while the others are distinctly shortened; in total about 34 dikinetids (Fig. 109a, e–l,
110j–m Table 40).
Oral apparatus grossglockneriid, i. e., minute and slightly subapical with feeding tube about 3 µm
long in vivo. Paroral membrane semicircular, cilia about 4 µm long in vivo. Adoral polykinetid
close posterior to feeding tube, likely composed of a row with three cilia and a second row with
one cilium, cilia 4–5 µm long in vivo, form a beating bundle. Pharyngeal fibres distinct, extend
vertically to mid-body (Fig. 109a, b, d, e, g, h, k, 110a–e, g–l; Table 40).
Occurrence and ecology: In the year 1996, we discovered this unusual ciliate in rain forest soil
from a small island in the Rio Negro (see type locality and Foissner 1997), where it was very rare
in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. We collected litter, soil and roots from 0–8 cm; litter layer
up to 5 cm thick, followed by a 3–5 cm thick root-carpet mixed with brown, humic soil; mineral
soil under root carpet loamy, brown, pH 5.1 in water.
It was a great surprise to find this conspicuous ciliate later in eastern Austria (Foissner et al.
2005a, Pseudoplatyophrya sp.), viz., in soil from a beech forest in the surroundings of the town
of Dürnstein, 48°24’ N 15°32’ E; in vivo, it was indistinguishable from the Brazilian specimens.
Like in Brazil, P. spinosa was very rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture and could not be
found in the protargol slides. The site we found it was investigated four times a year but P. spinosa
appeared at only one occasion indicating special needs.
Remarks: Pseudoplatyophrya spinosa is unique among all colpodids described in having a
cortical ridge pattern that forms two short spines on ventral side. If this pattern is inherent to the
species, then it is easily identified. But we cannot exclude that the posterior appendage contains a
microsporidian parasite – as described in a platyophryid colpodid by Foissner & Foissner (1995a,
b) – that causes the cortical ridges. For this case, we provide a detailed comparison with the ciliary
patterns of the congeners P. nana, → P. isabelae, and → P. galapagensis, as well as Nivaliella
316

plana (see Foissner 1993a for P. nana and N. plana). Ahead of this, we need to emphasize that
some misinterpretations of the ciliary pattern cannot be excluded because these ciliates are so tiny
and complex (e. g., caudal cilium associated with kinety 1 or 2, number of kinetids in a certain
kinety, 9 or 10 ciliary rows).
Pseudoplatyophrya nana, type of the genus and the most common fungivorous ciliate has much
more kinetids than P. spinosa (~ 60 vs. 34) and lacks argyrophilic material in the posterior body
end. → Pseudoplatyophrya isabelae differs from P. spinosa by ciliary rows 3 (composed of six
vs. one kinetid) and 7 (composed of five vs. two kinetids). → Pseudoplatyophrya galapagensis
differs from P. spinosa by ciliary row 4 (composed of four vs. two kinetids) and by rows 6 and
7 which end posterior vs. anterior to mid-body. Nivaliella plana, which has 10 ciliary rows like
P. spinosa (Foissner 1993a, Foissner et al. 2002), lacks a posterior accumulation of argyrophilic
material and ciliary rows 5 and 7 end in or near mid-body vs. extend to posterior body end.
Except of P. nana, all Pseudoplatyophrya species and Grossglockneria hyalina have deeply
impregnating material in the posterior body end, possibly fecal mass. However, the feeding tube
impregnates usually also deeply in all grossglockneriids, possibly due to the enzymes contained.
Thus, the deeply impregnating posterior material could contain similar enzymes as the feeding
tube.
Maryna meridiana nov. spec. (Fig. 111a–g, 112a–s, 113b, d, e, 124; Table 41)
2002 Maryna umbrellata (gelei, 1950) Foissner, 1993 – Foissner, agatha & berger, Denisia 5:
945 (misidentification; description and neotypification of a Costa Rican population).
Diagnosis (includes Costa Rican and Jamaican populations): Size about 100 µm or 65 µm in vivo,
slightly broader than high. Calix very broadly conical or globular, uvula moderately conspicuous.
Macro- and micronucleus globular to broadly ellipsoid. Contractile vacuole with short collecting
canals. Extrusomes within ciliary rows, rod-shaped, 3–4 µm long. About 46 ciliary rows and 20
kineties in left oral polykinetid. Resting cysts 57 µm across on average. Cyst wall about 1 µm
thick in vivo, covered by an up to 5 µm thick layer of glass granules 1–7 µm in size, most about
2 µm.
Type locality: In tanks of Guzmania monostachia (Bromeliaceae) along the road from the village
of Quick Step to the Aberdeen House, Jamaica, St. Elisabeth, about 77°33’W 21°30’ N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens and 5
paratype slides with Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-impregnated cells have been deposited in the
Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Meridiana (south, southern) is a Latin adjective that refers to the supposed restricted
Gondwanan (southern) distribution.
Description of Jamaican type population: The data are based on cultivated specimens from the
type locality (tape water and some crashed wheat grains). Although having well-impregnated
silver nitrate specimens (Table 41), we describe only protargol-impregnated cells fixed with ~

70% ethanol because silver nitrate prepared cells were used for the description of the Costa
Rican population (Foissner et al. 2002). Together, these preparations provide a very detailed
morphology.
Maryna meridiana has a moderate variability with all important features having variation
coefficients ≤ 15% (Table 41).

The ciliature, which consists of dikinetids,
is highly ordered. The uvula is free of cilia
except of the mycteral kineties that extend
to the excretory pore of the contractile
vacuole. The postoral kineties extend in
the diagonal (postoral) groove and have
a condensed ciliature. The excretory pore
of the contractile vacuole is anchored
by fibres. For the structure of the oral
polykinetids, see Figures 111a, c, 112j,

kineties, PK – postoral kineties, PL – oral
polykinetids, UV – uvula. Scale bar 25 µm.
µm high and 65 µm wide (Table 41). Calix (cap) usually broadly conical (Fig. 111e, 112a, i,
113d), becomes easily globular under oxygen stress and in preparations (Fig. 111a, f), ventrally
indistinctly flattened and with a shallow groove containing preoral suture. Uvula (trunk) rather
conspicuous because projecting distinctly from body proper, roughly triangular in lateral view
because merging into dorsal side, diagonal (postoral) groove comparatively flat (Fig. 111a, e, f,
112a, b, d, e, i, 113d; Table 41). Nuclear apparatus in or near mid-body on average (Fig. 111d, k,
l, 113d; Table 41). Macronucleus globular to broadly ellipsoid, in vivo about 20 µm across, with a
1 µm thick membrane and reticulate nucleolus. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, globular
to broadly ellipsoid, with distinct membrane separated from contents. Contractile vacuole in
uvula, with inconspicuous collecting canals and single excretory pore in centre of uvula surface;
excretory pore about 3 µm across, anchored to cell with short fibres (Fig. 111a, b, f, g, 112a, c–e,
113d). Cortex very flexible, gelatinous and about 1 µm thick, punctated by ciliary pits, in optical
section rather distinctly striated by the extrusomes (Fig. 112a, b, o, 113d). Extrusomes numerous
and scattered within ciliary rows, rod-shaped and fine, in vivo about 2–3 × < 0.5 µm, form an
indistinct cortical fringe, stain purple and become extruded, but do not explode when methyl
green-pyronin is applied (Fig. 112b, n, 113d); belong to the mucocyst type (Foissner, unpubl.).
Cytoplasm packed with inclusions: (i) numerous food vacuoles 3–6 µm and 10–20 µm in size in
the acid and alkaline phase, respectively; most filled with short bacterial rods, some with about
8 µm long, coiled bacteria (Fig. 112f, 113d); (ii) lipid droplets 1–4 µm, usually 2–3 µm across
(Fig. 112f, 113d); (iii) glass granules about 1 µm in size and forming a brownish spot in anterior
half of dorsal side, conspicuously sparkling under interference contrast while colourless under
transmitted light (Fig. 112g, h, 113b, d). Does not feed on Polytomella sp. even when present in

masses. Swims rapidly in narrow spirals. Does not build dwelling tubes neither in environmental
samples or in pure cultures grown at various conditions.
Somatic and oral ciliary pattern as typical for Maryna (Foissner 1993a). Silverline pattern also
as in congeners and described for a Costa Rican population by Foissner et al. (2002). All kinetids
paired, anterior cilium lacking in some mycteral kinetids. Cilia sprout from elliptic pits, of very
different length in vivo and in the scanning electron microscope: those on calix 10–12 µm long,
produce nice metachronal waves; mycteral and postoral s. str. cilia about 7 µm long; those in
diagonal (postoral) groove only 3–4 µm long; elongated caudal cilia definitely absent (Fig. 111d,
112c–e, o, 113d). Cilia arranged in an average of 46 rows including four postoral kineties s.
str.; rows extend spirally from anterior pole into diagonal groove with last kinetids distinctly
condensed, separated in a right and a left portion by a distinct preoral suture performing a sharp
right-turn anteriorly and widens on pole area; postoral suture also distinct because in a “stripe
contrast” zone, that is, the region where the loosely ciliated mycteral kineties right of the oral
opening abut in sharp angles on the more densely ciliated postoral kineties. Uvula surface barren
except of a few mycteral kineties extending to or near to excretory pore of contractile vacuole
(Fig. 111a, b, d, g, 112c–e, j–l, o; Table 41).
Oral apparatus between calix and uvula, small compared to size of cell (Table 41). Buccal cavity
conical, about 15 µm deep in vivo, extends obliquely to body centre. Oral opening elliptic, margin
of right half thickened, aboral side merges into diagonal groove (Fig. 111a, b, e, g, 112a, c, i,
o, 113d). Cilia of oral polykinetids 3–4 µm long in vivo, left polykinetid on bottom of buccal
cavity, elongate elliptic, i. e., 10 × 3.6 µm in protargol preparations, composed of an average of
19 monokinetal rows decreasing gradually in length at both ends. Right oral polykinetid on roof
of buccal cavity, cuneate with broad end proximally, composed of a proximal row of dikinetids
and of slightly irregular oblique rows of monokinetids. Pharyngeal fibres not impregnated but as
distinct as in M. umbrellata in specimens fixed with mercuric chloride (Fig. 111a–c, g, 112c, j,
k, n, o, 113d; Table 41).
Resting cyst (Fig. 112p–t, 113e; Table 41; for TEM details, see Foissner 2009): Highly similar
to that of Costa Rican population studied by Foissner et al. (2002). Globular, 57 µm across on
average and with glass layer, colourless but dark at low magnification (≤ 100×) due to the thick
layer of glass granules and the dense cytoplasm. Cyst wall composed of two distinct layers:
internal layer in vivo 0.5–1 µm thick while 1.5 µm in TEM micrographs because basal layer and
endocyst not recognizable in vivo; external layer slimy, up to 5 µm thick, composed of colourless
to yellowish glass granules 1–7 µm across in vivo while 1.9 µm in SEM micrographs (Fig. 112q,
s; Table 41), make small heaps producing a rough cyst outline (Fig. 112q), homogenous to ring-
shaped in the light microscope.
Extrusomes maintained, attached to the strongly crenelated cortex. Nuclear apparatus in or near
cyst centre, covered by an up to 2 µm thick layer of glass granules becoming reddish under
transmitted light and moderate magnification (250×), conspicuously sparkling under interference
contrast. Cytoplasm packed with lipid (?) droplets 1–3 µm across and some glass granules.
Molecular phylogeny (Foissner et al. 2014 and Fig. 124): We expected that M. meridiana would
326

make a clade with the similar → M. umbrellata or with M. ovata. However, M. meridiana makes
a well-supported clade (0.99/1.00) with a Botswanan Pseudomaryna that has a rather different
morphology (Foissner, unpubl.).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at four sites in Namibia (Foissner et al. 2002, misidentified
as M. umbrellata): granitic and dolomitic rock-pools, Okerfontein water-hole in the Etosha Pan);
Botswana (soil from a dry part of the Chobe River); Australia (lithotelma); Costa Rica (rock-
pools in the surroundings of the ranch house “La Casona”, Santa Rosa National Park), Jamaica
(tank bromeliad, see type locality), and Venezuelan sites 41, 42, 66, 70 (rock pools on granitic
outcroppings). Obviously, M. meridiana is restricted to ephemeral Gondwanan habitats. Very
likely feeds exclusively on bacteria.
Comparison of populations: There is only one remarkable difference between the Jamaican
population and those studied by Foissner et al. (2002), viz., body size in vivo: 50–75 µm in the
Jamaican type population while 80–110 µm in the Costa Rican specimens, 70–120 µm in the
Australian cells, and 70–90 µm in the Namibian specimens. Such differences are recognizable
also in silver nitrate-impregnated cells (Table 41): body width 48–72 µm vs. 74–96 µm in the
Costa Rican specimens. In contrast, the number of ciliary rows on body and in the left oral
polykinetid is very similar (Table 41). Thus, we consider the size differences of minor importance
and emphasize the other features, including the very similar resting cysts known, however, only
from the Jamaican and Australian populations.
Comparison with → M. umbrellata (Table 41): Although there is some overlap in body size, M.
umbrellata is on average considerably larger than M. meridiana (body width 132 µm vs. 63 µm
in silver nitrate preparations, 96 µm vs. 62 µm in Osmium fixed cells, and 129 µm vs. 58 µm in
protargol preparations). Further, the numbers of ciliary rows on body (83 vs. 46) and in the left
oral polykinetid (33 vs. 19) are markedly different. This applies also to the size of the resting
cysts (103 µm vs. 57 µm) and the thickness of the cyst wall (9.3 µm vs. 1.5 µm) while the glass
granules are distinctly smaller in M. umbrellata than in M. meridiana (0.8 µm vs. 1.9 µm). These
are massive morphometric differences justifying both as distinct species which is corroborated by
the molecular data discussed above.
Comparison with other congeners: Among the species reviewed by Foissner (1993a) and (re)
described by Foissner et al. (2002) only M. atra (gelei, 1950) Foissner, 1993a has some similarity
with M. meridiana. They differ by the macronucleus (ellipsoid vs. globular), the extrusomes (not
recognizable vs. 3 µm long rods), the cytoplasm (dark vs. opaque at low magnification), the left
oral polykinetid (composed of about 14 vs. 19 kineties), and the cyst wall (6–8 µm thick with
brown crystals in ectocyst vs. up to 2 µm thick and with conspicuous glass granules 1–7 µm
across).
The false neotypification of M. umbrellata (Gelei, 1950) Foissner, 1993a by Foissner et
al. (2002): Foissner et al. (2002) misidentified M. meridiana as M. umbrellata, assuming that
gelei´s data on body size and number of ciliary rows were incorrect. Now we know that this was
premature because another population matches gelei´s description much better except for the
short collecting canals of the contractile vacuole (see redescription of → M. umbrellata).

(detailed description of resting cyst).
Improved diagnosis (includes Hungarian type population and the Austrian specimens described
here): Size about 130 × 115 µm in vivo, slightly broader than high. Calix broadly conical, uvula
inconspicuous. Macro- and micronucleus globular to broadly ellipsoid. Contractile vacuole with
short collecting canals or small collecting vesicles. Extrusomes within ciliary rows, rod-shaped,
about 6 × 0.3 µm in size. On average 83 ciliary rows and 33 kineties in left oral polykinetid.
Resting cysts about 100 µm across on average. Cyst wall about 13 µm thick in vivo, including an
about 4 µm thick glass cover with glass granules ≤ 1 µm in size.
Type locality: Hungary, possibly in the surroundings of the town of Szeged (20°05’E 46°10’N).
The population investigated here is from an ephemeral grassland pond in the town of Salzburg,
Austria (13°02’40’’E 47°47’’30.7’’N; see Cotterill et al. 2013 for a detailed description).
Voucher material: 7 and 9 voucher slides with protargol and silver nitrate-impregnated (Chatton-
Lwoff method) specimens, respectively, have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper
Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in the original description. The Latin noun umbrella (sunshade, bell-
shaped) obviously refers to the umbrella-shaped calix.
Redescription: Most data are based on specimens cultivated on Eau de Volvic (French mineral
water) supplemented with some crushed wheat grains. This provides flourishing cultures.
Maryna umbrellata is ordinarily variable with most variation coefficients ≤ 15% (Table 41). The
high variability of the thickness of cyst wall (CV = 32%) is caused by a technical reason, i. e.,
when the cyst is not sectioned in the middle quarter then the wall becomes more or less obliquely
sectioned increasing its thickness.

Fig. 113a–e. Maryna umbrellata (a–c) and M. meridiana (d, e; from Foissner et al. 2002, refined to include Jamaican population)
from life and drawn to scale. a, d: The morphostatic specimens are in vivo very similar in body shape and structure but differ
distinctly in body size (~ 130 µm vs. 65 µm to 100 µm; Foissner et al. 2002). In silver preparations, the number of ciliary rows
on body (~83 vs. 46) and in the left oral polykinetid (~ 33 vs. 19) is markedly different (Table 41). b: Transverse view, showing
a slight dorsoventral flattening and the spot of glass granules. c, e: The resting cysts are quite different in size (~ 100 µm vs. 60
µm, Table 41) and structure: cyst wall without glass cover ~ 9 µm vs. 1 µm thick in vivo, glass granules ~ 2 µm (up to 7 µm) vs.
1 µm across on average. CV – contractile vacuole and excretory pore, D – debris, E – extrusomes form a rather distinct fringe, FV
– food vacuoles, GG – glass granules, forming a brownish, dorsolateral spot in the morphostatic specimens and a dense external
layer in the resting cysts, MA – macronucleus, MI – micronucleus, OO – oral opening, SU – preoral suture, W – cyst wall without
glass layer. Scale bars 50 µm.

331

Size highly dependent on culture conditions and growth phase, difficult to measure in vivo
because cells swim incessantly and rapidly. In the three preparations made, the cells have a size
of 75–130 (width) × 75–130 µm (height), 110–145 × 87–132 µm, and 93–160 × 80–150 µm
(Table 41) or 75–130 × 75–110 µm, 127–167 × 100–152 µm, and 107–184 × 92–173 µm when
preparation shrinkage is added (0% for osmium, 5% for Chatton-Lwoff sliver nitrate, 15% for
protargol). Taking the averages, an in vivo size of about 130 × 115 µm is obtained.
Calix broadly conical or hemiellipsoid, slightly broader than high; uvula broad but hardly
projecting from body proper because partially covered by posterior margin of calix. Ventral
side slightly flattened and with a shallow groove at site of preoral suture (Fig. 113a, 114a–i, k,
115d; Table 41). Location of nuclear apparatus highly variable (CV = 27%), on average slightly
anterior to mid-body. Macronucleus and micronucleus very broadly elliptic to globular, both with
a distinct membrane; nucleoli granular, numerous (Fig. 113a, n, 114f, r; Table 41). Contractile
vacuole in uvula, during diastole surrounded by some collecting vesicles never forming short
canals (checked in three specimens). Excretory pore in centre of uvula surface, about 4 µm
across (Fig. 113a, d, h, 114b, l). Cortex very flexible, gelatinous and about 1 µm thick, punctated
by deep ciliary pits, and in optical section indistinctly striated by the extrusomes (Fig. 113a,
114a–h). Extrusomes scattered within ciliary rows, numerous, rod-shaped, in vivo about 6 ×
0.3 µm in size, belong to the mucocyst type (Foissner, unpubl.). Cytoplasm colourless, turbid
because crammed with hundreds of food vacuoles most 5–10 µm in size, up to 30 µm in the
alkaline phase. In anterior half of dorsal side a brownish spot of glass granules about 1 µm in
size; some granules scattered throughout cytoplasm, conspicuously sparkling under interference
contrast (Fig. 113a, b, 114b, f). Feeds exclusively on 3–5 µm long bacterial rods, even when
masses of flagellates (Polytomella) are present. Dances rapidly in wide spirals within a globular
area; positive phototactic concentrating at bright side of Petri dish and on decaying wheat grains.
Divides in cysts with up to four tomites (Fig. 114m, n). Does not build dwelling tubes neither in
environmental samples or in pure cultures grown under various conditions.
Somatic and oral ciliature and silverline pattern as typical for Maryna (Foissner 1993a). All kinetids
paired, cilia sprout from deep, elliptic pits containing white spots when deeply impregnated (Fig.
114s), of very different length in vivo and in the scanning electron microscope: those on calix
about 15 µm long and producing nice metachronal waves, cilia in diagonal (postoral) groove
only 5 µm long; elongated caudal cilia definitely absent (Fig. 113a, 114i–l). Cilia arranged in an
average of 83 spiral rows including about six postoral kineties; very densely spaced throughout,
polymerization in postoral groove thus inconspicuous; separated in a right and left portion by
a very narrow preoral suture difficult to recognize in one third of specimens; postoral suture
distinct because in a “stripe contrast” zone, that is, the region where the mycteral kineties right
of the oral opening abut in sharp angles on the slightly denser ciliated postoral kineties. Uvula
surface loosely and irregularly ciliated (Fig. 113a, g, h, k, n, o, 114k, l, o–r, 115a, c–m; Table 41).
Oral apparatus between calix and uvula, small compared to body size (Table 41). Buccal cavity
about 25 µm deep in vivo, extends slightly obliquely to body centre. Oral opening elliptic, margin
of right half slightly thickened, aboral side merges into diagonal groove (Fig. 113a, g, 114a, h, k,
l, 115a, c; Table 41). Cilia of oral polykinetids about 4 µm long in vivo, left polykinetid on bottom
of buccal cavity, elliptic, i. e., 16 × 7 µm on average after protargol-impregnation, composed of
332

an average of 33 slightly oblique kineties gradually decreasing in length at both ends, associated
with some fibre bundles the strongest extending in postoral suture. Right oral polykinetid on roof
of buccal cavity, obliquely rectangular, composed of a proximal row of dikinetids and of slightly
irregular, oblique rows of monokinetids; associated with a long pharynx extending to anterior
pole and possibly U-shaped proximally (Fig. 113a, f, g, i, j, 114p, r, 115b, c, f–m; Table 41).
Resting cyst: This has been described by Foissner (2009) and Foissner et al. (2009b). Briefly,
the cyst has a diameter of about 100 µm of which the external 13 µm are made by the thick wall
including an about 4 µm thick glass cover with glass granules about 0.8 µm in size (Fig. 113c;
Table 41).
Molecular phylogeny: Of the 25 marynids described so far only three have been investigated for
gene sequences (Fig. 124). Maryna umbrellata makes a well-supported clade (0.86/1.00) with M.
meridiana and Pseudomaryna sp. while M. ovata produces a separate clade.
Occurrence and ecology: Few reliable records of M. umbrellata are known and all are from
ephemeral habitats of Europe suggesting that it might be restricted to Laurasia (Foissner 1993a,
Cotterill et al. 2013). Very likely feeds exclusively on bacteria.
Comparison with original description: Except of one feature all observations match the original
description of gelei (1950) who provided the following “hard” facts (Fig. 113l, m): Size in vivo
110–150 × 100–140 µm, depending on nutrition and growth phase; umbrella-shaped with width
usually slightly greater than height; uvula broad but short; cortex remarkably thick, indicating
extrusomes; with a spot of refractive granules on dorsal side; without dwelling tube; about 90
ciliary rows (the illustration shows only 50 at best, Fig. 113m); polymerization of ciliature in
diagonal groove indistinct; hard facts on oral apparatus and cyst lacking. The sole difference to
the Austrian population is the contractile vacuole which has collecting vesicles instead of canals
(Fig. 113a, l). The significance of this feature might be greater than it appears because canals or
vesicles are independent of body size (see → M. meridiana) and the gene sequence data do not
show M. umbrellata as nearest relative of → M. meridiana (with canals).
Comparison with → M. meridiana and other congeners: As concerns → M. meridiana, see that
species. Two other species have a considerable similarity in size and shape with M. umbrellata.
The most similar congener is M. cardioides (gelei, 1950) Foissner, 1993a, which shows a cordate
shape when sitting in its short dwelling tube absent from M. umbrellata. However, the most
valuable feature is the macronucleus (globular vs. ellipsoid). The second, less similar species is
M. galeata gelei, 1950. It is larger than M. umbrellata (in vivo about 200 µm vs. 130 µm), has a
helmet-shaped calix (vs. posterior edge of calix not crimped), a dwelling tube (vs. without), and
about 200 vs. 80 ciliary rows.
Neotypification: Cotterill et al. (2013) suggested neotypification of M. umbrellata with the
Austrian population described here. Basically, this is recommendable because the morphostatic
cells are difficult to distinguish from → M. meridiana. However, this would be premature

considering the difference in the contractile vacuole (see above). Thus, neotypification should
await data from other populations.
Maryna lichenicola (gelei, 1950) Foissner, 1993a (Fig. 116a–c)
Material: Venezuelan sample (29). Two voucher slides with Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). Some relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

et al. 2002). b: Oral apparatus in a left laterally oriented specimen. The arrowhead marks a row of dikinetids at the proximal

Remarks: This species has been carefully redescribed by Foissner et al. (2002), using live
observation and protargol impregnation (Fig. 116a, b). Here, we add a silver nitrate-impregnated
specimen with well preserved body shape and silverline pattern (Fig. 116c).
Sandmannides nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small Sandmanniellidae with almost circular right oral polykinetid open slightly right
and posterior of preoral suture. Several minute adoral polykinetids at right margin of preoral
suture and anterior of right oral polykinetid.
Type species: Sandmannides venezuelensis nov. spec.
Etymology: Sandmannides is a composite of the personal name Sandmann and the Latin suffix
340

ides (similar), indicating a similarity with the genus Sandmanniella Foissner & stoeCK, 2009a.
Masculine gender.
Remarks: Foissner & stoeCK (2009a) described a curious Colpodean from Africa, Sandmanniella
terricola, with a very narrow oral basket resembling the basket of the nassulids. It was a great
surprise to find a ciliate with the same feature in Venezuela. The Venezuelan species resembles
the genus Notoxoma Foissner, 1993a, which forms a clade with Sandmanniella in most molecular
trees (Foissner et al. 2011). Thus, we reinvestigated Notoxoma parabryophryides (Fig. 117b)
which has, indeed, an oral basket similar to that of Sandmanniella and Sandmannides. The basket
is very narrow and has been overlooked by Foissner (1993a).
Sandmannides differs from Notoxoma by the orientation of the opening of the right oral
polykinetid (almost in main body axis vs. left lateral; Fig. 117a, b, 118a, d) and the location of the
adoral polykinetids (outside the circle formed by the right polykinetid, right of the preoral suture
vs. between the ends of the right polykinetid; Fig. 117a, b, d, 118a, d, e). Sandmannides differs
from Sandmanniella by the shape of the right oral polykinetid (circular vs. lunate; Fig. 117a, c,
e, f), the location of the left oral polykinetids (right of the preoral suture vs. vis a vis of the right
polykinetid posterior to the preoral suture; Fig. 117a, c, e, f), and the absence (vs. presence) of a
perioral ciliary condensation right of the oral apparatus (Fig. 117a, c, e, f, 118e). Parabryophrya
Foissner, 1993a, is similar to Notoxoma but has a deeper oral cavity with vestibular kineties
absent from Sandmanniella and Sandmannides. We reinvestigated excellently impregnated
specimens from Austria and could not find an oral basket, indicating that it is not congeneric.
Sandmannides venezuelensis nov. spec. (Fig. 117a, d, 118a–e)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 60 × 35 µm; ellipsoid. On average 22 ciliary rows extending spirally
from anterior to posterior. Right oral polykinetid composed of about 25–30 short kineties. About
5 adoral polykinetids each composed of dikinetids.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (23), i. e., field (Mahadja) soil from the surroundings of the
village of El Sapo and the Orinoco River, that is, about 50 km north of Pto. Ayachuco, Venezuela,
67°36’°W 5°41’N.
Type material: 1 holotype slide with three protargol-impregnated specimens, marked by black
ink circles on the coverslip, has been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI).
Etymology: Named after the country in which it was discovered.
Description: We found only three specimens in the protargol slides, and we did not recognize the
species in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Thus, in vivo observations are lacking. In spite of
this, we describe this population because (i) it has a clear identity, (ii) the preparation is excellent,
and (iii) because it is phylogenetically very important (see Remarks to genus).
Size in vivo 47–63 × 30–38 µm, usually about 60 × 35 µm when adding 15% shrinkage to the
protargol preparation. Body ellipsoid to slightly ovate (Fig. 117a, 118a, d). Macronucleus in
central third of cell, globular to slightly ellipsoid, after protargol impregnation 14 × 13 µm in
size. Micronucleus, contractile vacuole, and cytoplasm not impregnated.

present also in Sandmannides (a, d) and Notoxoma (b). LP – left oral polykinetid, MA – macronucleus, MI – micronucleus, OB –
oral basket, RP – right oral polykinetid, SU – preoral suture. Scale bars 20 µm (a–c, f).
Somatic ciliature colpodid, i. e., composed of dikinetids forming about 22 ciliary rows in each of
the three specimens found; rows commence at preoral suture and postorally and extend spirally
to posterior body end; third kinety right of oral apparatus with an average of 35 dikinetids (Fig.
117a, 118a–d).
Oral apparatus about 8 µm subapical, conspicuous in protargol preparations because right
polykinetid forms a strongly impregnated circle composed of about 25–30 minute ciliary rows
342

Fig. 118a–e. Sandmannides venezuelensis after protargol
impregnation. Only the three specimens shown were
found in the preparations. The most conspicuous feature
is the almost circular right oral polykinetid present also
in Notoxoma (Fig. 117b) and Parabryophrya (Foissner
1993a). a, b, e: Ventral and dorsal view of holotype
specimen, length 55 µm. Arrowheads in (e) limit the five
adoral polykinetids each consisting of a row of dikinetids. c:

right oral polykinetid. Scale bars 5 µm (e) and 20 µm (a–d).
343

with length gradually decreasing at ends of polykinetid (Fig. 117a, d, 118a, c, d). Oral cavity
about 3 µm deep, in or near centre a basket only 1 µm across and extending to mid-body (Fig.
117a, d, 118a, d, e). Right polykinetid about 6 µm across, opens slightly right of oblique preoral
suture right of which insert about five dikinetal adoral organelles of different length (Fig. 117a,
d, 118e). We cannot exclude the presence of a dikinetal row along the dorsal margin of the right
polykinetid.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in very fertile soil.
Remarks: This is a very distinct species which, however, in vivo can be easily confused with
Notoxoma parabryophryides (more slender, i. e., 2.8 vs. 2:1) and Parabryophrya penardi
(without vs. with distinct vestibular kineties recognizable also in vivo). The identification should
be checked in silver carbonate or protargol preparations.
Bryometopus rostratus nov. spec. (Fig. 119a–d, 120a–e)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 70 × 30 µm; rostrate. Single micronucleus. Contractile vacuole
far subterminal. Oral apparatus on ventral side, occupies about one quarter of body length,

and after silver carbonate impregnation (d). a, c: Right side view of representative specimens, length about 70 µm. Note the
considerable difference in body shape and the far subterminal contractile vacuole, an important difference to B. balantidioides,
which has it in the posterior end. b: The Brazilian specimens are slightly longer and narrower than those from Venezuela. d:

parallel to longitudinal axis of body, right wall of oral cavity overhangs left. On average (n = 5)
17 somatic kineties, 11 adoral polykinetids, and 22 dikinetids in right oral ciliary field.
Type locality: Soil and litter from an organically farmed banana plantation at the farm (Ganja
Cochama) of Mr. eisenberg, about 50 km NE of Puerto Ayacucho, Venezuela, 67°36’W 5°41’N.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: The Latin adjective rostratus refers to the rostrate anterior body end.
Description: This species was present only during the second day after rewetting the sample.
The abundance was very low, and thus we could prepare and morphometrically analyze only five
silver carbonate-impregnated specimens.
Size of specimens from type locality 60–85 × 25–35 µm in vivo, usually about 70 × 30 µm;
Brazil specimens larger and narrower, i. e., 80–100 × 20–30 µm (Fig. 119b). Body shape highly
variable, basically bluntly fusiform with rostrate anterior portion; posterior end acute to narrowly
rounded (Fig. 119a–c, 120a, b); only slightly flattened laterally. Nuclear apparatus in mid-body
(Fig. 119a, d, 120a–c). Macronucleus ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid and with reticular nucleolus.
Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, broadly ellipsoid, 2–3 µm in size. Contractile vacuole
distinctly subterminal near margin of ventral and right side (Fig. 119a–c, 120e). Cortex slightly
furrowed by ciliary rows. Particular cortical granules or extrusomes not recognizable in vivo and
in silver carbonate preparations. Food vacuoles comparatively conspicuous because up to 15 µm
across, contain bacteria and their undigested spores (Fig. 119a, 120e). Swims rapidly rotating
about main body axis.
Somatic cilia paired throughout, about 7 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 17 (16–
19) rows all commencing around oral aperture and most extending slightly spirally to posterior
body end; postoral rows rather irregular, shortened posteriorly sometimes forming a suture-like
pattern. On average 34 (29–44) kinetids in longest dorsal kinety, narrowly spaced anteriorly in
the four dorsal kineties (Fig. 119a, d, 120a–c).
Oral apparatus on ventral side in longitudinal axis of body, in lateral view partially covered by
overhanging right body side; small, i. e., occupies about one quarter of body length and possesses
only 11 (10–11) adoral polykinetids on average. Right oral ciliary field a single, convex row
composed of an average of 22 (20–24) dikinetids (Fig. 119a, c, d, 120a, d).
Occurrence and ecology: As mentioned above, B. rostratus disappeared three days after
rewetting the sample, indicating an r-selected life strategy, as most colpodids (Foissner 1987b).
A second population was found in the Pantanal, Brazil. Like the Venezuelan specimens, it was
present only during day two after rewetting. Considering these records and the absence in over
1000 soil samples investigated globally, B. rostratus might be endemic to the Neotropis.
Remarks: Of the 10 Bryometopus species described (Foissner 1993a), only the Australian B.
balantidioides resembles B. rostratus in some main morphometrics: on average 15 vs. 17 somatic
ciliary rows and 25 vs. 22 dikinetids in the right oral ciliary field. These species share also another
346

important feature, viz., the ventral location of the oral apparatus. Nevertheless, B. balantidioides
and B. rostratus can be easily distinguished by body shape (reniform vs. rostrate), the location
of the contractile vacuole (in posterior end vs. distinctly subterminal), and the number of adoral
polykinetids (25 vs. 11 on average).
Bursaria ovata beers, 1952 (Fig. 121a–k, 122a–x, 123a–v; Table 42)
Material: This species occurred at Venezuelan site (56). Here, we describe a population from
Botswana, i. e., from floodplain soil near to the Kwai River Lodge (23°45’E 19°5’S). The soil,
which is very fine and almost black, is covered with Sphaeranthus incisus and a dry, paper-thick
algal layer; pH 5.3 in water. Bursaria ovata was cultivated in tap water enriched with some
ml eluate from the non-flooded Petri dish culture and some squashed wheat grains to stimulate
bacterial production and growth of indigenous protists and of Colpidium colpoda which was
added as food (Fig. 121a, 122e, s). Six and five voucher slides with Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate
and protargol-impregnated specimens, respectively, have been deposited in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.
Description: The Botswanan population is very similar to the North American specimens
described by beers (1952). Thus, we describe mainly new and/or deviating observations and
refer to the opulent illustration, the morphometric analysis, and to Foissner (1993a) who fully
cites the description of beers (1952).
Body size on average highly similar in three cultures and preparations (Table 42): 535 × 307
µm (1.7:1) in vivo, 521 × 323 µm (1.6:1) in Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate preparations, and 511
× 330 µm (1.6:1) in protargol slides, and thus distinctly smaller than beers’ cells (500–1000 ×
250–475 µm); laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 121c, 122n). Body shape rather variable and
indistinguishable from that of B. truncatella, i. e., bursiform with anterior end transversely
truncate and posterior bluntly pointed (Fig. 122b, h, i, k, l, 123m) to broadly rounded, especially
when full of food (Fig. 121a, b, 122a, o); left body margin usually less convex than right. Precystic
specimens distinctly narrowed posteriorly (Fig. 121g, 122c, d, g). Macronucleus as described by
beers. Micronuclei numerous, in vivo about 10 µm across and composed of an about 5 µm wide,
compact central body surrounded by a distinct membrane 2.5 µm distant from central body (Fig.
121f), as described by sChMähl (1926) for B. truncatella.
Extrusomes misinterpreted by beers as alveolar layer, form conspicuous rows composed of
granules about 2 µm across in surface view (Fig. 121e, 122p, r); in optical section about 20
× 2 µm and very hyaline, producing a bright, smooth fringe (Fig. 121h, 122q, 123c, j); when
disturbed, contract (?) to about 10 µm becoming a compact, radially striated fringe (Fig. 121i,
122o, s, t); continued disturbance causes extrusome release and size increase to about 20 µm
without loosening the compact structure (Fig. 121j); then, the extrusomes elongate to 30–60
µm long, curved, rather hyaline rods (Fig. 121j, 122u, w) that eventually become long (> 100
µm) filaments forming a thick envelope (Fig. 121k, 122v, x, 123v). Extrusome holes prominent
in silver preparations (Fig. 123a, h, u) and in scanning electron micrographs (Fig. 123b, d).

Underneath extrusome layer many curious vesicles 5–10 µm across and filled with argyrophilic
granules (Fig. 121b, 123e–g); not identical with contractile vacuoles.
Omnivorous, i. e., feeding on flagellates, testate amoebae (Arcella), and a variety of ciliates, e. g.,
Colpidium colpoda. Food depletion causes encystment (Fig. 121a, 122b, e, f, s).
Somatic cilia 15 µm long in vivo, paired, arranged in an average of about 288 ordinarily spaced
359

rows (~ 2.7 µm, Table 42); ciliary pattern indistinguishable from that of B. truncatella, including
a triangular field of unciliated basal bodies at margin of right wall of buccal cavity (Fig. 122g–i,
k, l, 123a, b, h, q). Silverline pattern irregular reticulate, both on body (Fig. 123h, u) and in wall
of buccal cavity (Fig. 123r).
Oral opening circular (Fig. 122j), with a narrow ventral cleft extending 60% of body length on
average (Fig. 121a, b, 122a, g, i, k, l, n, 123i, m; Table 42). Buccal cavity and oral polykinetids
almost U-shaped, i. e., extend from anterior to near posterior body end and then recurves anteriorly
left of body´s midline to mid-body on average, as already described by beers (Fig. 121a, b, 122a–
d, 123e, i–m; Table 42). Oral polykinetids as in B. truncatella.
Resting cysts basically as in B. truncatella but height of bridges between ectocyst and endocyst
only about 1 µm, bridges thus difficult to recognize (Fig. 123s, t, w); considerably smaller than
described by beers (Table 42): 176–212 µm vs. 230–280 µm (with wall); young cysts with
distinct mucous envelope (Fig. 123w).
Identification: Our observations basically match the description of beers (1952), except of the
resting cyst and the extrusomes, which beers did not recognize as such: “The ectoplasm is clearly
differentiated as a radially striated alveolar layer which bears a superficial pellicle and contains the
basal bodies of the cilia”. Unfortunately, beers (1952) did not provide measurements. However,
his illustrations indicate that the “striated alveolar layer” is 8–9 µm thick which matches our data
in the striated explosion phase (Fig. 121a, b, i, 122o, s).
For the resting cysts, beers (1952) states: “Bridges uniting ectocyst and endocyst, as in B.
truncatella, are absent”. In contrast, bridges are present in our population (Fig. 123t, w). However,
they are often difficult to recognize because they are only 1 µm high. Thus, we assume that beers
(1952) overlooked the bridges. The same happened sergejeva (1989) who first missed bridges
but later found them (sergejeva et al. 1995).
Comparison with B. truncatella: beers (1952) distinguished B. ovata from B. truncatella by
the U-shaped oral apparatus and the lack of bridges in the resting cyst. The second feature is
very likely a misobservation (see above) but can be replaced by the extrusomes which are clearly
different: 1–5 µm in B. truncatella (Foissner 1993a and unpubl.) while about 20 µm in B. ovata
(Fig. 122o–t, u–x, 123c). The U-shaped oral structures are in some specimens not very pronouned
(Table 42) and might thus overlap with some specimens of B. truncatella (Foissner 1993a, Fig.
185b, e). However, usually it is a reliable character, especially in connection with the unique
extrusomes.
There is no doubt that B. ovata and B. truncatella are closely related. This is corroborated by the
very similar 18rDNA (Fig. 124). Further, there is no doubt that several Bursaria species exist
(Fig. 124). However, their identity is threatened by several more or less incorrect descriptions of
B. truncatella (for a review, see Foissner 1993a). Both, the European and the North American B.
truncatella need careful redescription because they are possibly different species, as indicated by
their 18rDNA (Fig. 124).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in temporary habitats of the USA, Russia, Belgium,
Botswana (Southern Africa, present population), and Venezuelan site (56).

Woodruffiina nov. subordo
The Colpodea were revised by Foissner et al. (2011, 2014b). These authors recognized four well
supported molecular clades (Fig. 124), one of which is the order Platyophryida, containing the
suborders Platyophryina and Sorogenina as well as the families Platyophryidae, Woodruffiidae,
Sagittariidae, and Reticulowoodruffiidae.
Here, we describe two new genera, Apowoodruffia and Sagittariides, which form a strongly
supported molecular clade with the genera Woodruffides and Sagittaria (Fig. 124). We classify
Fig. 124. Nuclear SSU-rDNA molecular tree of the Colpodea (from Foissner et al. 2011, 2014b), showing the classification of
the new genera Apowoodruffia (“Platyophrya-like” in Foissner et al. 2011) and Sagittariides (“Rostrophrya sp.” in Foissner et
al. 2011) as well as of the species Sagittaria venezuelensis (“Sagittaria sp.” in Foissner et al. 2011), Platyophryides macrostoma
(Platyophryides n. sp. in Foissner et al. 2013b), Bursaria ovata (“Bursaria muco” in Foissner et al. 2013b), and Maryna meridiana
(“Maryna sp.” in Foissner et al. 2013b).

this clade as a distinct suborder, not only due to the molecular distinctness but also because of
the resting cysts, which are distinctly different from those of the Platyophryina and Sorogenina
(for a review see Foissner 1993a; Fig. 125, 126): The wall is tripartite and of an orange colour
in the former (this monograph), while a simple, colourless, 1–3 µm thick layer in the latter (Fig.
125m). The suborder is classified into two families: the Woodruffiidae gelei, 1954 (containing
Woodruffides and possibly several other genera, such as Rostrophrya, Rostrophryides, and
Kuklikophrya) and the Sagittariidae grandori & grandori, 1934, containing the genera
Sagittaria, Apowoodruffia, and Sagittariides, all described in the following chapters.
Diagnosis: Small to large (~ 30–300 µm), oblong to rostrate Platyophryina with circular to slit-
like oral opening at anterior pole or the rostrate portion. Micronucleus in perinuclear space of
macronucleus. Silverline pattern platyophryid or colpodid. Postoral pseudomembrane absent.
Divides in freely motile condition or in division cysts. Resting cysts conspicuously orange, with
thin, yellowish ectocyst; thick, orange-coloured mesocyst; and thin, colourless endocyst.
Type family: Woodruffiidae gelei, 1954.
Taxa assignable: Woodruffiidae gelei, 1954 and Sagittariidae grandori & grandori, 1934.
Remarks: The position of the Reticulowoodruffiidae Foissner, 1993a, a monotypic family and
genus, remains unknown. The best feature to distinguish the Woodruffiina from the Platyophryina
and Sorogenina are the resting cysts. All other characteristics occur in all suborders but with
different frequency. For instance, the postoral pseudomembrane, which is absent from all
Woodruffiina and in Sorogena as well as in some genera of the Platyophryina, viz., in Ottowphrya,
Rostrophrya, and Kuklikophrya. However, the molecular position of the last mentioned genera
is still unknown.
Woodruffides metabolicus (johnson and larson, 1938) Foissner, 1993a (Fig. 124,
125a–l, 126a)
Our observations match those of previous authors (reviewed by Foisser 1993a), especially in
the strong pigmentation of the mature cyst. However, the illustrations available are meagre and
micrographs are lacking at all. Thus, we redescribe the cyst, based on Japanese specimens from
soil of a rice field in the surroundings of the Lake Biwa museum (Fig. 125a, 126a).
The young cyst (Fig. 126b, c): Young cysts are colourless to yellowish and have an up to 20 µm
wide, bright cover that contains many granular accumulations, i. e., extruded cytoplasmic and/
or nuclear material, as have many other colpodids (Foissner 1993a). This conspicuous, hyaline
layer, which does not stain with alcian blue, is followed by an about 2 µm thick, colourless,
compact cover, the endocyst. The cyst contents is colourless and coarse-grained (Fig. 125b, c).
The mature cyst (Fig. 125d–l, 126a): Cysts are mature, i. e., do not change further after a week.
They are remarkable in being so strongly pigmented that details can be studied only in pressed
(flattened) and crushed specimens (Fig. 125d, f, g). The cysts, which are globular to slightly
ellipsoid, have an average size of 71.9 × 71 µm (M = 70 × 68 µm, SD = 9.2/9.5 µm, CV =
362

Fig. 125a–f. Woodruffides metabolicus, immature (b, c) and mature (d–f) resting cysts from Japanese specimens. Arrows mark
extruded cytoplasmic and/or nuclear material. The dark appearance of the mature cysts is caused by the deep orange pigmentation.
a: Left side view of a vegetative specimen with obliquely truncate anterior body end (arrowhead) and distinct contractile vacuole
(CV). b, c: Young cysts show two distinct wall layers. The thick, hyaline external layer is yellowish and later forms the ecto-
and mesocyst. The thin, colourless endocyst is distinct because it is highly refractive. d, f: Mature cysts at moderate and low
magnification. When encysting, the cells accumulate and become loosely connected by the ectocyst (d, arrowheads). e: Crushed
cyst, showing the colourless endocyst (EC) and the strongly pigmented ecto- and mesocyst (ET, MC). Scale bars 5 µm (e), 25 µm
(b), 50 µm (c, d), 75 µm (f), and 100 µm (a).

Fig. 126a, b. Woodruffides metabolicus and Woodruffia rostrata, mature resting cysts. The cysts have three distinct layers (EC,
ET, MC), an average diameter of 70 µm and 57 µm, respectively, and are orange to dark brown. EC – endocyst, ET – ectocyst,
MA – macronucleus, MC – mesocyst, S – space between ectocyst and mesocyst, V – vacuoles. Scale bars 30 µm.
12.7/13.4%, Min–Max = 62/97 µm, n = 13) and are deep orange to dark brown, resembling insect
cuticulas (Fig. 125d, f–l). However, the Van Wisselingh chitin test, as described by Foissner et
al. (2005b), is negative, i. e., the cysts dissolve completely in KOH, while cysts of Blepharisma,
fungal spores, and cellulose remain and give clear reactions. The cyst wall is on average 5.2
µm thick (M = 5 µm, SD = 0.6 µm, CV = 11.5%, Min–Max = 4–7 µm, n = 13) and composed
of three layers. The external layer (ectocyst?) is brownish, 1–2 µm thick, and attaches to the
middle layer (mesocyst?), which is orange to dark brown, 2–3 µm thick, and structureless (Fig.
125d, e, g, h, 126a). Extruded cytoplasmic and/or nuclear material occurs between the external
and middle layer, forming more or less distinct protrusions (Fig. 125d, h, i, l). The middle layer
originates by shrinkage of the thick coat covering young cysts (Fig. 125d, e, g–l, 126a). The inner
layer (endocyst?) is colourless, about 1.5 µm thick and structureless (Fig. 125e, j, k, 126a). The
cytoplasm is colourless and packed with lipid (?) droplets 2–4 µm across and countless granules
less than 0.5 µm in size. The macronucleus is about 20 µm across and in the centre of the cyst
(Fig. 125d, e, g, h, k, 126a).
Woodruffia rostrata Kahl, 1931 (Fig. 126b, 127a–g, 128a-h)
Material: Site (68), i. e., Isabela Island, Galápagos (silver preparations) and Venezuelan site
(65; SEM micrographs and resting cysts). Two voucher slides (one protargol-impregnated, the
other Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-impregnated) have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the
Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Some relevant specimens have been marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.

cortex is distinctly furrowed by the ciliary rows and is
partially covered with bacteria, as usual in saline soil
habitats. g: Oral apparatus. The paroral membrane
covers the buccal lip (arrowhead) and consists of a single
row of needle-shaped cilia. The adoral polykinetids
are composed of short, dull cilia with different length.
The asterisk marks the oral slit which can open widely
to ingest even large prey (Fig. 127e). AP – adoral
polykinetids, BA – epicortical bacteria, OA – oral
apparatus, PM – paroral membrane. Scale bars 5 µm (g)
and 40 µm (f).
Resting cyst: The mature resting cyst of specimens from highly saline coastal soil of Venezuelan
site (65) is remarkable in being so strongly pigmented that details can be studied only in pressed
(flattened) and/or crushed cysts (Fig. 128e–h). The cysts have an average total diameter of 57
µm (52–63 µm, n = 6) and are orange, dark brown, or russet. The cyst wall is 5–10 µm thick,
depending on the width of the space between ectocyst and mesocyst, and consists of three layers.
The external layer (ectocyst?) is yellowish to brownish, 0.5–1 µm thick, and usually strongly
wrinkled and widely separate from the middle layer (Fig. 126b, 128a–d, g). The middle layer
(mesocyst?) is orange to russet, 2–4 µm thick, and compact (Fig. 126b, 128b–d, g, h). The internal
layer (endocyst?) is colourless, 1–2 µm thick, structureless, and elastic (Fig. 126b, 128c, e, g).
About half of the specimens have two internal layers: when squeezed, one layer comes out of the
cyst, forming a small sphere, while the other layer remains within the cyst (Fig. 128f, h).

Fig. 128a–h. Woodruffia rostrata, mature resting cysts under bright field illumination. The dark appearance of the cysts is caused
by the deep orange to dark brown pigmentation of the mesocyst. a: A typical cyst with russet colour and two large vacuoles in
the cytoplasm. b–d: Typical cysts, showing the thin, distinctly wrinkled ectocyst; the thick, strongly pigmented mesocyst; and the
thin, colourless endocyst. e: When slightly pressed, the cyst wall breaks and the elastic, colourless endocyst comes out of the cyst.
f, h: As Figure (e) but with two endocyst-like structures, one each outside and inside the cyst. g: Squashed cyst, showing the three
wall layers. EC – endocyst, ET – ectocyst, MC – mesocyst, V – vacuoles, W – cyst wall. Scale bars 30 µm.
368

The cyst’s cytoplasm is colourless and contains two 10–20 µm-sized vacuoles with invisible
contents (Fig. 128a); an about 15 µm wide macronucleus; and countless 0.5–3 µm-sized granules
(Fig. 126b, 128b–d).
Remarks: Woodruffia rostrata has been reported from the Holarctis, the Palaeotropis, and the
Australis (Foissner et al. 2002). Now, we found it also in the Neotropis, showing that it is a
cosmopolitan preferring slightly to highly saline coastal habitats. It is a voracious predator feeding
on ciliates ingested whole (Fig. 127e).
Foissner (1987a, 1993a) redescribed W. rostrata from the Cape Verde Island Santo Vicente. The
Galápagos and Venezuelan specimens are highly similar, i. e., have about 35 ciliary rows and
10 adoral polykinetids, of which two insert anterior to the paroral membrane (Fig. 127a–d, f, g).
The silverline pattern is colpodid. Scanning electron microscopy shows a “typical” platyophryid
somatic and oral ciliary pattern (Fig. 127f, g).
Apowoodruffia Foissner & buosi nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small to moderately small Woodruffiina with oral apparatus on right side of body and
slanted to left of main body axis. Adoral polykinetids brick-shaped, one usually in line or anterior
of distal end of hooked right oral ciliary field (dikinetal paroral membrane). Silverline pattern
colpodid. Resting cyst woodruffid.
Type species: Apowoodruffia salinaria nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the generic name Woodruffia,
meaning a ciliate genus similar to Woodruffia. Feminine gender.
Remarks: At first glance, Apowoodruffia resembles Platyophrya due to the shape of the body
and oral apparatus. However, Platyophrya has the oral apparatus slanted to the right of the main
body axis. The colpodid silverline pattern separates Apowoodruffia from Woodruffides which
has a platyophryid silverline pattern. → Sagittaria and → Sagittariides, which have the same
silverline pattern as Apowoodruffia, have a polar oral opening. This unique character constellation
justifies separation at genus level. For family classification, see discussion of the new suborder
Woodruffiina.
Apowoodruffia salinaria Foissner & buosi nov. spec. (Fig. 129a–j, 130a–r, 131a–
q, 132a–j; Table 43)
Diagnosis: Size about 75 × 30 µm in vivo. Usually elongate reniform with slightly narrowed
anterior region. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end with excretory pore in pole centre. On
average 18 somatic ciliary rows. Oral apparatus with 4–5 adoral polykinetids and an about 6 µm
long, hooked paroral membrane comprising 20 dikinetids on average.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (65), i. e., highly saline soil from the north coast of Venezuela,
369

Morrocoy National Park, surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, 67o13’W 11o33’N.
Etymology: The adjective salinaria (saline environments) refers to the saline habitat the species
was discovered.
Type slides: 1 holotype and 3 paratype and voucher slides with Chatton-lwoFF silver nitrate-
impregnated specimens and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated cells have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens
have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description: To obtain sufficient material, we re-wetted and dried the sample several times.
This showed a considerable variability in body shape and size in the preparations, mainly due
to the widening of the cells in Chatton-lwoFF silver nitrate-impregnated specimens (Table 43).
Apowoodruffia salinaria was difficult to impregnate with ordinary methods; however, when fixed
with da Fano’s fluid, beautiful protargol preparations were obtained.
Size 60–85 × 25–50 µm in vivo, usually about 75 × 30 µm, as calculated from in vivo measurements
and values shown in Table 43; length:width ratio 1.7–3.3:1, usually 2.4:1 in protargol preparations;

1.6–2.4:1, usually 1.9:1 in silver nitrate preparations; and about 2.6:1 in vivo (Table 43). In
protargol preparations with specimens from first re-wetting shape rather variable, that is, 22 out
of 50 specimens elongate ovate with a shallow postoral concavity making it more or less reniform
or Colpoda maupasi-shaped (Fig. 129a, h, 130a, e, r); 20 specimens elongate ellipsoid with a
more or less concave ventral side, making it sausage-shaped (Fig. 129d, h, 130a, c, o, 132a, b,
i); rarely ellipsoid or ovate (Fig. 129g, h, 132h); in Chatton-lwoFF silver nitrate preparations
with specimens from second re-wetting, shape basically as in protargol preparations, but broader
(Fig. 129g, i); specimens from first re-wetting usually sausage-shaped, those from last re-wetting
usually elongate ovate or ellipsoidal with slightly concave left margin, making them sausage-
shaped or slightly reniform both in vivo and in SEM (Fig. 129a, d, 130a, c, e, 132a, b, i, j); shape
fairly dependent on nutritional state, that is, hungry specimens slender and up to 2:1 flattened
laterally (Fig 129d, 130d, f). Nuclear apparatus in or near centre of cell on average (Fig. 129a,
f, 130l, o, r; Table 43). Macronucleus about 8 µm across in preparations, contains some small
nucleoli. Micronucleus hemispherical, attached to macronucleus by flattened side, about 2.5 ×
1.5 µm (Fig 129a, 130o, p; Table 43). Contractile vacuole in posterior end with excretory pore
near pole centre (Fig. 129a, i, 130e–h, 131b, e). Cortex distinctly furrowed by somatic kineties,
contains numerous bright, colourless granules (possibly mucocysts) about 0.4 µm across; usually
rather densely covered by bacteria (Fig 129b, c, 130h–k, 132c, f–h). Cytoplasm without specific
inclusions, often studded with lipid droplets 2–6 µm across; likely feeds on bacteria and fungal
spores (Fig. 129a, 130b, e, g). Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis. Division
occurs in freely-motile (non-encysted) condition.
Somatic cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, paired in anterior body third, anterior cilium absent in
middle and posterior third. On average 18 slightly sigmoid ciliary rows all commencing around

dikinetids not forming a postoral pseudomembrane (Fig 129a, e, f, j, 130h, i, l, o, q, r, 131a, d,
132a, b, e, i, j; Table 43).
Oral opening subapical, occupies on average 35% of anterior body width; elliptical to broadly
elliptical, on average 7.1 × 4.6 µm in protargol preparations (Fig. 129a, e, j, 130h, n, o, 131a, d,
132c–e, h–j; Table 43). Right oral ciliary field hooked, about 6 µm long in preparations, composed
of a single row of 20 ciliated dikinetids on average; cilia 3–4 µm long and invariably curved to
oral slit in SEM preparations, basal bodies associated with fibres forming right half of pharyngeal
basket (Fig 129a, e, j, 130l–q, 131a, e, 132c–e; Table 43). On average four small, rectangular
adoral polykinetids on left mouth margin, one usually in line with or anterior and slightly right
of right oral ciliary field; individual polykinetids obliquely oriented to main mouth axis, distal
polykinetid often perpendicularly orientated, composed of two rows with three basal bodies each;
cilia 3 – 4 µm long and invariably curved posteriorly in SEM preparations, absent from one of the
two rows in at least the most distal polykinetid (Fig 129a, e, j, 130h, l–q, 131a, e, 132c–e; Table
43). Pharyngeal basket extends to mid-body, formed by fibres originating from right ciliary field
and adoral polykinetids (Fig. 129e, j).
Silverline pattern colpodid throughout, meshes often rather irregular (Fig. 129i, 131a, c, e, g).
Transverse silverlines between ciliary rows usually originating from longitudinal silverlines
connecting kinetids of kineties; often stair-shaped, likely due to strong cortex furrowing, creating
a sort of line between each two ciliary rows, i. e., a platyophryid-like pattern (Fig. 129i, 131a, c,
e). Nevertheless, an ordinary colpodid pattern occurs in several specimens, as well as combined
with a platyophryid-like pattern (Fig. 131g). Silverlines also surround excretory pore and docked
extrusomes (Fig. 129i, 131b, e).
Resting cysts globular, about 26 × 25 µm in vivo without ectocyst and 36 × 35 µm on average
with wrinkled ectocyst (Table 43). Overall structure and colour as in → Woodruffia rostrata, to
which the reader is referred to (Fig. 131h–q). During encystment, cells become ovate and covered
by an up to 5 µm thick mucus layer populated by bacteria (Fig. 131h, j). Usually only one (two
in W. rostrata) vacuole.
Occurrence and ecology: To date only found at type locality, i. e., soil from a highly saline,
abandoned field on the north coast of Venezuela. The species can be cultivated on squeezed wheat
grains and artificial sea water with a salinity of 20–60‰.
Remarks: See Foissner (1993a) and Foissner, agatha & berger (2002) for detailed descriptions
of the species mentioned in the following discussion.
Apowoodruffia salinaria resembles some Platyophrya and Rostrophryides species, such as P.
vorax, P. sphagni, P. spumacola, and R. africana, not only due to body shape and size but also
because of some narrowly spaced kinetids – which may be mistaken as a postoral pseudomembrane
– posterior to the adoral polykinetids. Further, silver nitrate preparations are required to reveal
the silverline pattern, which is colpodid in A. salinaria while platyophryid in Rostrophryides
379

and in Platyophrya. Nevertheless, the stair-shaped silverlines of A. salinaria create a sort of line
between each two ciliary rows, and may thus be easily confused with a median silverline, i. e.
the main feature of the platyophryid silverline pattern. Apowoodruffia and Platyophrya can be
separated also on careful live observation by the orientation of the oral apparatus: slanted to left
vs. right.
Apowoodruffia salinaria also resembles Semiplatyophrya acrostoma and Platyophryides latus.
The former species is similar to A. salinaria in the shape of the body and in the number of adoral
polykinetids while the latter is similar in body size and shape, the number of adoral polykinetids,
and the silverline pattern. However, S. acrostoma has a minute, apically located oral apparatus
and a platyophryid silverline pattern on the left side, and P. latus has the adoral polykinetids
parallel to the right oral ciliary field and its oral apparatus is oriented to the right of the main body
axis.
Sagittaria venezuelensis nov. spec. (Fig. 124, 133a–c, f–l, 134a–y, 135a–l; Table
44)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 35 × 25 µm; obovate to bursiform. 1 globular macronucleus and
1 micronucleus. Contractile vacuole in posterior end, with single excretory pore in or near pole
centre. On average 22 spiral ciliary rows distinctly furrowing cortex. Oral opening broadly
elliptical; paroral membrane composed of an average of 21 ciliated dikinetids with interkinetidal
spaces gradually increasing from ventral to dorsal side of cell; on average 6 minute adoral
polykinetids most composed of 3 rows with 3–5 basal bodies each.
Type locality: Venezuelan sample (65), i.e., highly saline soil from the north coast of the Morrocoy
National Park, surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, 67°13’W 11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated cells and 3 slides
with Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-prepared specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country where it was discovered, i. e., Venezuela.
Description: To get clear protargol preparations, the species was fixed with ethanol. This caused
about 20% shrinkage and widening of body and of the oral field, as evident from a comparison of
the length:width ratios in vivo and in well-fixed material used for SEM (Table 44).
Size in vivo 30–42 × 24–38 µm, usually about 35 × 25 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and values shown in Table 44 adding 20% preparation shrinkage due to ethanol
fixation. Body shape rather variable, ordinarily to broadly obovate (Fig. 133a, b, 134a, b) or
bursiform (Fig. 134c, e, q, r), depending on amount of food ingested and culture conditions;
unflattened (Fig.133c, 134j, s, x). Anterior body end usually slightly obliquely truncate, rarely
transversely truncate, posterior end rounded to bluntly pointed (Fig. 133a, b, 134a–e, q). Nuclear
apparatus usually anterior of mid-body (Fig. 133a, 134f, g, m; Table 44). Macronucleus globular,
hyaline, with comparatively large, oblong nucleoli, about 10 µm across in protargol preparations.
380

Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, possibly in its perinuclear space, globular to broadly
ellipsoidal, 2–2.5 µm after protargol impregnation. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end
(Fig. 133a, b, 134b, f, g, 135d, j), with single excretory pore in or near pole centre (Fig. 135d,
j). Cortex very flexible, colourless, usually distinctly furrowed by ridges right of ciliary rows,
distinctness depending on amount of food ingested and culture conditions; often studded with
bacteria (Fig. 133a, 134a–i); cortical granules not detectable neither in vivo or silver preparations.
Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to many globular to broadly ellipsoid food vacuoles with
sporolating bacteria 2–5 µm in size; some small lipid droplets; and sometimes a large defecation
vacuole containing many highly refractile bacterial spores and fluffy material (Fig. 133a, b,
134a–i). Swims rapidly, never rests, does not build a case.
Somatic cilia in vivo about 8 µm long, arranged in an average of 22 narrowly or ordinarily spaced
rows commencing around oral opening and extending spirally to barren posterior pole. Ciliature
composed of dikinetids slightly more densely spaced in perioral area and in left half of cell,
anterior cilium lacking posterior of perioral dikinetids. Without postoral pseudomembrane (Fig.
133a, f, h, j, l, 134m–r; Table 44).
Silverline pattern colpodid, i. e., composed of rectangular meshes extending between ciliary rows
(Fig. 134k, l).
Oral opening occupies about half of anterior pole area, elliptical to broadly elliptical, slightly
deepened (Fig. 133a–c, f, j, 134b–d, m–w; Table 44). Paroral membrane on right margin of oral
opening, C-shaped, composed of an average of 21 dikinetids with about 5 µm long, pointed
cilia; distance between dikinetids distinctly increasing from ventral to dorsal end of oral opening;

µm (b, c) and 20 µm (a, e).
external row of cilia active, internal row likely passive because cilia appear immobile in SEM
micrographs (Fig. 133a, c, f, j, 134m–p, s–x; Table 44). On average six adoral polykinetids on left
margin of oral opening; individual polykinetids rhomboid, composed of three, rarely of two rows
with three to five basal bodies each, about two thirds of basal bodies barren, according to SEM.
Most adoral cilia only 2–3 µm long and with blunt end, especially in ventral half of polykinetids;
some cilia up to 5 µm long and pointed, mainly in dorsal half of polykinetids (Fig. 133a, f, g, i–k,
134f, g, i, m–p, s–x; Table 44).
Ontogenesis: This was followed in the scanning electron microscope. It commences with the
resorption of the external ciliary row of the paroral membrane and a shortening of the adoral cilia
(Fig. 134x, y). Next the internal row of the paroral membrane and the somatic cilia are resorbed to
stumps while a stump grows out from the barren anterior basal body of the dikinetids (Fig. 135a,
b). Finally, the oral opening and the entire oral and somatic ciliature have been resorbed (Fig.
135c). When furrowing commences, new cilia and a new oral apparatus become recognizable in
proter and opisthe, clearly showing that the paroral membrane consists of two ciliary rows (Fig.
135e–h). During these processes, the opisthe rotates slightly relative to the proter, as recognizable
by the oral apparatus (Fig. 135i, j). When the cells separate, the ciliature is usually fully developed

(Fig. 135i, j), rarely the cilia are still growing (Fig. 135k, l).
Molecular phylogeny (Fig. 124): The molecular tree shows S. venezuelensis within a clade
containing Apowoodruffia salinaria, Sagittariides oblongistoma, and Woodruffides metabolicus.
This is corroborated by distinct morphological similarities mentioned in the diagnosis of the →
Woodruffina.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Moderate numbers developed in
the non-flooded Petri dish culture one to two days after re-wetting; then it disappeared. When the
sample was air-dried several times, the same cycle was performed, indicating that S. venezuelensis
is more r- than k-selected.
Remarks: There is only one similar species, viz., Sagittaria australis PoMP & wilbert, 1988 (Fig.
133d, e), which has the contractile vacuole far subterminal (vs. terminal), possesses a distinct
hump (vs. absent), and has the paroral membrane composed of equidistantly spaced dikinetids
(vs. gradually increasing from ventral to dorsal) and the adoral polykinetids built of two (vs.

three) rows of basal bodies. In vivo, S. venezuelensis can be confused with → Apowoodruffia
salinaria which, however, is usually larger (75 × 30 vs. 35 × 25 µm in vivo) and more slender (~
2.4:1 vs. 1.4:1).
The ontogenesis is very similar to that of other platyophryids, for instance, Platyophyrides latus,
and to that of colpodids in general, for instance, Bromeliothrix metopoides (Foissner 1993a,
2010a; Foissner et al. 2002). Possibly, the rotation of the opisthe is less pronounced.
Sagittaria hyalina Foissner, CZaPiK & wiaCKowsKi, 1981 (Fig. 136a–k)
Material: Site (68), i. e., Galápagos (ciliary pattern) and Venezuelan site 65 (lorica).
Remarks: Sagittaria hyalina was discovered in a road puddle near the University of Cracow.
Since then, we found indistinguishable populations in many soil samples globally, especially
when they were saline (Foissner et al. 2002). Here, we show specimens from Galápagos, matching
very well the Polish population (Foissner et al. 1981).
Sagittaria has a simple organization and is closely related to Platyophrya (Fig. 136). The figures
in Foissner et al. (1981) show insufficiently the dense circumoral ciliature composed of 6–8
very narrowly spaced dikinetids, except of one or two ventral kineties which have only two to
three dikinetids (Fig. 136e–k). Body size and shape are very variable, especially in highly saline
habitats. The slimy lorica is rarely recognizable because the inhabitants leave it when they are
transported from the sample to the microscope slide, where lorica building can be observed with
some patience (Fig. 136a–d).
Sagittarides Foissner & buosi nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small to moderately small, laterally flattened Sagittariidae with narrowly elliptic
oral aperture in a shallow, slightly oblique concavity of anterior body end. One or more adoral
polykinetids anteriorly of hooked right oral ciliary field (paroral membrane). Silverline pattern
colpodid. Resting cyst woodruffid.
Type species: Sagittarides oblongistoma nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the generic name Sagittaria and the Greek suffix ides (similar),
meaning a ciliate genus similar to Sagittaria. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Among members of the family Sagittariidae, Sagittarides oblongistoma is unique in
having a polar, narrowly elliptical oral opening and one or more polykinetids anterior of the right
oral ciliary field. These features justify a generic separation.
Sagittarides oblongistoma has some similarities with members of the family Woodruffiidae, viz.,
a narrow oral aperture and polykinetids anterior of the right oral ciliary field. However, the
Woodruffiidae have the oral apparatus on the ventral side, i. e., not apically as the Sagittariidae.
For a revision of the families mentioned, see Foissner (1993a).
392

Sagittarides oblongistoma Foissner & buosi nov. spec. (Fig. 124, 137a–t, 138a–
y, 139a–l; Table 45)
Diagnosis: Size about 55 × 35 µm in vivo. Usually obtriangular or bursiform with transverse or
obliquely truncate anterior end. On average 26 somatic ciliary rows. Oral apparatus with 7 adoral
polykinetids and an about 15 µm long, hooked paroral membrane comprising 33 dikinetids on
average.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (65), i. e., highly saline soil from the north coast of Venezuela,
Morrocoy National Park, surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, 67o13’W 11o33’N.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective oblongus (oblong) and the Greek noun stoma
(mouth), i. e., an apposition referring to the oblong shape of the mouth entrance, a main feature
of the species.
Type slides: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens and 4
paratype slides with silver nitrate-impregnated cells have been deposited in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.
Description: When we had finished the observations, we dried the sample. After seven years
we rewetted it again, and rich populations of S. oblongistoma and → Apowoodruffia salinaria
developed. Three differences were recognized in S. oblongistoma, viz., most cells were more
slender (~ 1.8:1) and hardly flattened, few specimens showed an anterior obliquity, and all cells
were colourless because the cyanobacteria did not survive the long period of drought, showing
that S. oblongistoma reproduces well on bacteria (Fig. 138a–h, k). This species impregnates very
well with protargol after fixation with da Fano’s fluid as used for Chatton-lwoFF silver nitrate
impregnation.
Size in vivo 40–65 × 30–45 µm, usually about 55 × 35 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and values shown in Table 45 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body shape
very variable, length:width ratio 1.6:1 on average in protargol preparations, usually obtriangular
as observed in 53% (Fig. 137a, c, e, o, 138a–c, h, m, 139a, b) out of 60 specimens analyzed,
bursiform in 42% (Fig. 137b, d, q, r, 138q, r), rarely ellipsoid or globular (5% of specimens;
Fig. 138d, e, g, 139c); anterior body end also rather variable, that is, in 62% out of 50 protargol-
impregnated specimens transverse truncate (Fig. 137b, d, r, 138c, r), in 30% obliquely to slightly
obliquely truncate (Fig. 137a, e, 138a, b, h, m, q, 139a), and in 8% more or less convex (Fig. 137c,
138d–g, 139b, c); many specimens with a small obliquity at left anterior end (Fig. 137a, e, 138c,
h); posterior end broadly rounded to pointed (Fig. 137a–e, 138a–h, 139a, b); laterally flattened
up to 2:1. Nuclear apparatus usually in middle body third (Fig. 137a, p, q, s, t, 138m, n, q, r;
Table 45). Macronucleus very hyaline in vivo, globular to broadly ellipsoid, about 12 × 9 µm in
preparations, contains some small nucleoli only recognizable in faintly impregnated specimens;
macronuclear contents often wrinkled and strongly shrunken in preparations. Micronucleus
hemispherical, about 2 × 1.5 µm, invariably attached to macronucleus by its flattened side,

possibly out of perinuclear space in 24 out of 27 specimens observed (Fig. 137a, 138o; Table
45). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end with single colleting canal extending anteriorly
near ventral margin of cell; excretory pores and cytopyge in central pole area (Fig. 137a, 138a,
v). Cortex distinctly furrowed by somatic kineties, often covered with bacteria (Fig. 139c, d);
ridges studded with granules (extrusomes) about 0.4 µm across (Fig. 137k, 138k). Cytoplasm
colourless, specimens, however, may become greenish due to ingested filamentous cyanobacteria
(Oscillatoria sp.), forming golden food vacuoles up to 15 µm across during digestion; possibly
feeds mainly on cyanobacteria (Fig. 137a; but see above). Glides rather rapidly on microscope
slides and soil particles, does not build a gelatinous case. Division occurs in freely motile (non-
encysted) condition.
Somatic cilia about 10 µm long in vivo. On average 26 slightly spiral ciliary rows all beginning
around oral entrance, ventral rows on average with 40% fewer kinetids and slightly more
narrowly spaced than dorsal rows; both basal bodies of dikinetids ciliated in anterior third, while
anterior basal bodies barren in middle and posterior third; first 5–10 dikinetids of ciliary rows
underneath polykinetids more closely spaced, forming a densely ciliated area in left anterior
quadrant of cell (Fig 137a, o, p, r, s, 138m, q, r, u–w, 139a, e, g, h; Table 45). Some kineties end
subterminally, producing a rather irregular ciliary pattern in posterior pole region; rarely, a distinct
ventral suture produced by irregularly shortened midline kineties (Fig. 137q). Long transverse
microtubule ribbons originate from posterior basal bodies of dikinetids and extend posteriorly to
form conspicuous LKm fibres left of somatic kineties (Fig. 137l, q, 138m, n, q, r, 139b).
Oral opening in a shallow, slightly oblique concavity of anterior body end, commences near
ventral body margin and extends dorsally slightly right of main body axis, in or near middle
third of anterior body end when viewed ventrally (Fig. 137t), occupies 40–72%, on average
57% of anterior body width; overall appearance rather variable (Fig. 137a–e, g, h, i, m, o, q,
r, 138m, p–s, u, y, 139a, e–h; Table 45): elongate elliptic to elliptic in 30 out of 60 protargol-
impregnated specimens, very elongate elliptic in 15 specimens, elongate ovate in 12 specimens,
and circular in 3 distorted, globular specimens; in 64% out of 14 Chatton-lwoFF silver nitrate-
impregnated specimens elongate elliptic to elliptic and in 36% ovate. Right oral ciliary field
(paroral membrane) composed of a single row of about 33 dikinetids with curved cilia about 5
µm long in vivo, right portion strongly curved abutting on last adoral polykinetid. Six to nine,
on average seven rectangular, obliquely oriented polykinetids (adoral organelles) on left mouth
margin, of which 1–3 are anterior of ventral end of paroral membrane often having a perpendicular
orientation; individual polykinetids composed of three ciliary rows, rarely of two, each with three
basal bodies some of which may be lacking; often 1 or 2 rows of basal bodies barren; cilia curved
posteriorly in SEM preparations (Fig. 137a, g, h, i, m, o, q, r, 138m, p–s, u, y, 139e–h; Table 45).
Pharyngeal fibres originate from paroral and adoral kinetids, extend posteriorly near right margin
of cell, and curve upwards in posterior body third (Fig. 137o, r, t, 138m, q).
Silverline pattern colpodid, i. e., composed of rather wide and regular meshes produced by short,
transverse silverlines extending between longitudinal silverlines connecting kinetids of a kinety
(Fig. 137f, 138w–y). Silverlines usually studded with extrusomes (Fig. 138y).

Resting cysts globular, on average 28.7 × 27.2 µm in size (M = 28 / 27.5, SD = 2.8 / 2.4, CV =
9.9 / 9, Min = 25 / 25, Max = 35 / 32, n = 9), lightly to deeply orange-coloured, contain many lipid
droplets 1–3 µm across. Ectocyst smooth to slightly wrinkled, about 0.5 µm thick. Mesocyst and
endocyst 1–2 µm thick, mesocyst coloured as described above, separated from ectocyst by a 3–5
µm wide space containing accumulations of granular excretes (Fig. 137n, 138i, l).
Occurrence and ecology: To date only found at type locality, i. e., in soil from a highly saline

(about 50‰), abandoned field on the north coast of Venezuela.
Remarks: See Foissner (1993a) and Foissner et al. (2002) for detailed descriptions of the families,
genera and species mentioned in the following discussion.
A near relative of Sagittarides oblongistoma is apparently Sagittaria australis because it has the
same location of the oral apparatus and does not build a gelatinous case present in S. poligonalis
and S. hyalina. This is supported by the molecular data (Fig. 124). However, S. australis has a
broadly elliptic oral field and a different body shape (usually bursiform vs. obtriangular), and the
adoral polykinetids do not extend beyond the right oral ciliary field. Further, S. oblongistoma is
about twice as large as S. australis, and thus the number of ciliary rows is also higher (on average
22 vs. 26).
In vivo, Sagittarides oblongistoma may be confused with Etoschophrya oscillatoriophaga
Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002, which has a similar size and shape, also lives in highly saline
soils, and feeds on filamentous cyanobacteria. However, the oral apparatus of E. oscillatoriophaga
is in the left anterior quadrant of the cell, while it is in the middle third of the anterior body end
in S. oblongistoma. Further, S. oblongistoma has a colpodid silverline pattern that differentiates it
not only from E. oscillatoriophaga (right side of body with platyophryid, left side with kreyellid
silverline pattern) but also from other members of the family Woodruffiidae, like Rostrophryides
spp. and Kuklikophrya spp., which resemble S. oblongistoma in vivo but have a platyophryid
silverline pattern and, in case of Rostrophryides spp. a postoral pseudomembrane. On the other
hand, Woodruffia spp. have a colpodid silverline pattern like S. oblongistoma but the ventral
position of the oral apparatus is quite different.
Mancothrix nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small Platyophryidae without postoral pseudomembrane. Silverline pattern
platyophryid. Adoral polykinetids minute, rhomboid.
Type species: Mancothrix pelobia nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective mancus (incomplete) and the Greek noun thrix
(hair ~ ciliate), referring to the absence of a postoral pseudomembrane. Feminine gender.
Remarks: We compiled the most similar genera in Table 46. This shows that Mancothrix is highly
similar to Platyophrya and Rostrophryides except for the lack of a postoral pseudomembrane
which we consider as a generic feature.
Mancothrix pelobia nov. spec. (Fig. 140a–d, f–i, 141a–h; Table 47)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 45 × 15 µm. Elongate ovate with oblique and slightly curved
anterior end containing the oral apparatus. 1 macronucleus and 1 micronucleus. 9–10 ciliary rows,
those of left side sparsely ciliated. Oral apparatus platyophryid, 4–5 minute adoral polykinetids.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (21), i. e., mud from lithotelmas of the Cataniapo River, 67°36’W
5°36’N.
403

Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens and 1
slide with Chatton-lwoFF silver nitrate-prepared cells have been deposited in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latinized adjective pelobia (living in mud) refers to the habitat the species was
discovered.
Description: All preparations were made on the same day, i.e., the soil eluate was split: one half
was used for protargol impregnation, the other for silver nitrate preparations. Thus, it can be
excluded that different species were investigated (see oral apparatus).
Size in vivo 35–55 × 12–20 µm, usually about 45 × 15 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data adding 15% and 5% shrinkage for the protargol
and silver nitrate preparations, respectively (Table 47). Data from both preparation methods
fairly similar, except for body width which is distinctly smaller (12.1 µm) in silver nitrate than
protargol preparations (17.4 µm) where specimens are likely slightly inflated (Table 47). Body
typically platyophryid, i. e., elongate ovate or reniform and occasionally slightly curved, oral
apparatus at oblique anterior end, laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 140a–d, f–i, 141a, b, e–h).
Nuclear apparatus in mid-body on average, macronucleus globular, micronucleus ellipsoid and
likely in perinuclear space of macronucleus. (Fig. 140a, c, 141e–h; Table 47). Contractile vacuole

subterminal, approaches ventral side (Fig. 140a, b, h). Cortex very flexible, slightly furrowed
by ciliary rows; cortical granules (extrusomes) not studied in vivo, possibly absent because
not recognizable in the preparations. Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to rather many lipid
droplets and food vacuoles up to 10 µm across (Fig. 140a). Feeds on spore-forming bacteria,
heterotrophic flagellates, and naked amoebae. Usually glides on mud accumulations, showing
great flexibility; swims slowly rotating about main body axis.
Somatic cilia in vivo about 8 µm long, arranged in nine or ten ordinarily spaced rows extending
slightly spirally from oral apparatus to posterior body end. Right side rows densely ciliated
with an average of 24 dikinetids, left side rows sparsely ciliated because composed of only 13
dikinetids most lacking the anterior cilium (Fig. 140a–d, h, i, 141a–h; Table 47). Left side rows
commence close posterior of adoral polykinetids with two narrowly spaced, ciliated dikinetids
but do not form a postoral pseudomembrane (Fig. 140b, i, 141b, e) shown in Figure 140e.
Silverline pattern platyophryid throughout, irregulary reticulate in posterior pole area (Fig. 140d,
h, 141a–d).
Oral apparatus in oblique anterior end, composed of a curved, dikinetal paroral membrane and
four to five minute, rhomboid adoral polykinetids (Fig. 140a, b, f–i, 141a,b, e–g; Table 47).
Cytopharyngeal rods inconspicuous, extend to dorsal side of cell. Orientation of oral opening as
in Platyophrya as shown by a plasticine model, i. e., obliquely extending from left to right (Fig.
140f, h); most specimens, however, ventrolaterally oriented in the preparations making the oral
pattern rostrophryid, i. e., extending slightly obliquely from left to right (Fig. 141e–g).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., highly fertile Mahadja soil.
The abundance was low in the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Remarks: This small, highly flexible ciliate is easily confused with the genera mentioned in Table
46. However, the absence of a postoral pseudomembrane can be recognized with interference
contrast and some experience. Identifications should be checked in protargol or silver carbonate
preparations.
Platyophrya bromelicola Foissner & wolF, 2009 (Fig. 142a–n)
Material: Cultivated populations from tank bromeliads of Rio de Janeiro (cyst) and Jamaica
(live, morphostatic specimens).
Remarks: Platyophrya bromelicola is probably confined to tank bromeliads and unique in making
microstomes and macrostomes. Foissner & wolF (2009b) could not induce cyst formation. Later,
we were successful in a pure culture where resting cysts were readily produced, most in small
heaps with 50–200 specimens (Fig. 142j). Further, Foissner & wolF (2009b) did not show in
vivo micrographs of the unique, bluntly clavate body (Fig. 142a–i).
The resting cysts are spherical with an average diameter of 17 µm (M = 17.0, SD = 0.5, CV =
13.2, Min = 14, Max = 21, n = 18). The cyst wall is structureless, smooth, colourless, and 0.6–1

µm thick (Fig. 142l, m). When the contents is pressed out, the cyst diameter decreases and the
wall becomes 2–3 µm thick (Fig. 142k). Within the cyst are scattered lipid (?) droplets 0.5–2 µm
across, which produce conspicuous rows subcortically (Fig. 142n). The cyst centre is occupied
by the nuclear apparatus. To sum up, the resting cyst of P. bromelicola is highly similar to that of
the common P. spumacola described by Foissner (1993a).
Platyophryides macrostoma nov. spec. (Fig. 124, 143a–j, 144a–y, 145a–m; Table
48)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 120 × 80 × 50 µm. Bursiform to broadly bursiform with oral
portion usually curved ventrally; right side flattened. 1 broadly ellipsoid macronucleus and 1
micronucleus. Excretory pore of contractile vacuole subterminal in midline of right body side.
On average 38 slightly spiral ciliary rows, those on right side closer together and more densely
ciliated than those on left side. Oral apparatus in anterior body end, oral field narrowly oblong,
paroral membrane about 35 µm long, composed of dikinetids having ciliated only the left basal
body. On average 6 adoral polykinetids each about 3 µm long and composed of 2 rows of basal
bodies of which only the right row is ciliated.
Type locality: In mud of bamboo stumps from the Bamboo Avenue west of the town of Lacovia,
Jamaica, 77°49’W 18°05’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens and 4
slides with Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-prepared cells have been deposited in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and relevant paratype specimens have
been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: macrostoma (large-mouthed) is an apposite noun composed of the Greek adjective
makrós (large) and the Greek noun to stóma (mouth), referring to the large mouth.
Description: Specimens cultivated on Tetrahymena mobilis were used for all investigations.
The morphometry is based on silver nitrate-impregnated specimens because good protargol
preparations were obtained only with ethanol-fixed and thus rather strongly shrunken (~ 20%)
specimens. However, we choose as holotype a protargol preparation because it shows the oral
details better than the silver nitrate-impregnated specimens.
Size in vivo 85–150 × 50–100 µm, usually about 120 × 80 µm, as calculated from data in Table
48 adding 5% preparation shrinkage. Shape bursiform, oral portion about half of maximum
body width and slightly to distinctly curved ventrally, producing a more or less oblique anterior
end (Fig. 143a, 144a, b, d, f–i, x, y, 145k–m; Table 48). Right side flat to slightly convex, left
side slightly to strongly convex depending on amount of food ingested (Fig. 144c, e). Nuclear
apparatus in or near body centre on average. Macronucleus broadly ellipsoid, nucleolus reticulate.
Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, broadly ellipsoid (Fig. 143a, g, 144j, l, u, 145a, e; Table
48). Contractile vacuole and excretory pore subterminal slightly left of body´s midline, with short
canal extending anteriorly (Fig. 143a, 144c, f, h). Cytopyge posterior to contractile vacuole (Fig.
144a, h). Cortex very flexible, contains countless minute, protargol-affine granules (extrusomes?)
409

along ciliary rows of right side and in silverline pattern in left side (Fig. 145n, o). Cytoplasm
densely granulated, contains small lipid droplets and up to 10 food vacuoles with Tetrahymena
(Fig. 143a, c, 144x, y, 145k–m). Feeds also on middle-sized hypotrichs, heliozoans, and becomes
cannibalistic in old cultures. Glides and swims comparatively slowly but never rests, usually
gliding in and on mud accumulations, showing great flexibility.
Cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 38 ordinarily spaced, slightly spiral,
bipolar rows narrower spaced and denser ciliated in right than left side of body; ordinarily spaced,
except of densely ciliated oral portion both in right and left side; paired in right side, anterior
cilium lacking in about half of dikinetids of left side; dikinetids obliquely arranged in trunk area;
some ciliary rows more or less shortened anteriorly and/or posteriorly, especially in excretory
pore area (Fig. 143a, g, h, 144a, b, d, e–l; Table 48). Silverline pattern colpodid throughout (Fig.
143i, 144v).
Oral apparatus in oblique, usually slightly concave anterior body end (Fig. 143a, c, d, g, j, 144a,
d, e, f, h–j, l, o–t, w, 145a; Table 48). Oral field and oral opening very elongate oblong (Fig.
143d, j, 144e, t). Right margin of oral field occupied by a paroral membrane composed of about
75 oblique dikinetids of which only the inner (left) basal body is ciliated (see ontogenesis). Left
margin of oral field occupied by an average of six adoral polykinetids each about 3 µm long
and composed of two ciliary rows, of which only the inner (right) row is ciliated; length of cilia
gradually increases from dorsal to ventral (Fig. 143a, c, d, g, j, 144h, j, l, o–q, t, 145a; Table

48). Oral basket prominent in protargol preparations, made of nematodesmata originating from
paroral dikinetids and adoral polykinetids; nematodesmata thickened in mid of length and then
transformed to a smooth tube (Fig. 143a, c, j; Table 48).
Resting cyst (Fig. 143b, e, 145i, j; Table 48): One-week-old cysts globular, in vivo 41.5 µm across
on average, colourless, without peculiarities. Wall about 1.2 µm thick, composed of two layers
very near together, surface smooth. Cytoplasm densely granulated, contains some inclusions up
to 6 µm across. Contractile vacuole and ciliary rows disappeared.
Ontogenesis: Division is highly similar to that of P. latus described by Foissner et al. (2002) and
to platyophryids in general (Foissner 1993a). In the SEM preparations, we found five dividers
reorganizing the proter oral apparatus (Fig. 145c, d, g) and a late divider developing the opisthe
oral apparatus (Fig. 145f, h). The following details can be recognized on the photographs:
1. The parental (proter) oral apparatus is reorganized, i. e., the cilia are resorbed. When the
division furrow appears, cilia sprout from the basal bodies. In the paroral and adoral anlagen
appear two rows of cilia in proter and opisthe, viz., an external row with very short cilia and an
internal row with longer cilia (Fig. 145c, d, g). The external row is obviously resorbed in very
late dividers and post-dividers to obtain the single row typical for the morphostatic specimens
(Fig. 144p–t);
2. The newly formed adoral polykinetids are obliquely oriented in proter and opisthe (Fig.
144m, n, 145e–h). The genus-specific linear arrangement (Fig. 144j, o) is obtained in very
late dividers and in post-dividers.
The interpretation of these observations is difficult but the development of a second row of cilia
in the paroral and adoral ciliature is very likely a plesiomorphic feature because they are resorbed
in late dividers and in post-dividers. This is sustained by observations on Reticulowoodruffia
terricola which has both paroral kineties ciliated (Foissner et al. 2002).
Except of Platyophryides and Ottowphrya, all platyophryids and woodruffids have the adoral
polykinetids obliquely oriented (Foissner 1993a, Foissner et al. 2002). In Platyophryides, an
oblique orientation occurs only during ontogenesis (Foissner et al. 2002; Fig. 144m, n, 145e–h).
Thus, the linear arrangement, which occurs only in morphostatic cells (Fig. 144j, o), is very
likely an apomorphic state.
Molecular phylogeny: The 18 SSU-rDNA of P. macrostoma has been sequenced by Foissner et
al. (2014b) under the name Platyophryides sp. (Fig. 124). It is quite similar to that of Ottowphrya
and Sorogena, which matches morphology but not the unique life cycle of Sorogena (for a review,
see Foissner 1993a).
Occurrence and ecology: Bamboo stumps are an interesting habitat for protists because
competition is reduced due to the short times they are filled with water and the small surface
restricting distribution of potential predators. As yet, we did not find P. macrostoma in tank
bromeliads but it occurred in soil samples (69) and (70) from Galápagos, showing wide
distribution in terrestrial and semiterrestrial habitats. Possibly, it occurs also in Venezuela where
we identified Ottowphrya dragescoi in samples (13), (23), and (26). We cannot exclude that these
were P. macrostoma because we did not check the silverline pattern and the resting cyst.
421

Platyophryides macrostoma is easily cultivated with tap water and the middle-sized ciliate
Tetrahymena mobilis. But it feeds also on other protists and becomes cannibalistic in old cultures
when Tetrahymena prey disappears and large Platyophryides feed on small ones.
Remarks: Platyophryides macrostoma is easily distinguished from → P. latus, the single
congener redescribed and neotypified by Foissner et al. (2002) and here shown by a multitude
of micrographs (Fig. 146). Platyophryides latus is more slender than P. macrostoma (34 µm vs.
76 µm on average) and thus has a lower number of ciliary rows (23 vs. 38 on average) and a
much smaller oral width (15 µm vs. 43 µm on average). In contrast, body shape and size of P.
macrostoma are highly similar to Ottowphrya spp. reviewed in Foissner et al. (2002). They can be
reliably distinguished only by the silverline pattern: colpodid in Platyophryides (Fig. 143i, 144v)
while platyophryid in Ottowphrya (Fig. 145p). The structure of the cyst wall is also different (Fig.
143e, f). Generally, the cyst of P. macrostoma is highly similar to that of Platyophrya spumacola
(Foissner 1993a).
Platyophryides latus (Kahl, 1930) Foissner, 1987 (Fig. 143f, 146a–p)
Material: Venezuelan sample (5, live observation) and moss from Jamaica (silverline pattern).
Remarks: Platyophryides latus has been carefully redescribed by Foissner et al. (2002). Thus, we
mention only some live observations from the Venezuelan population and provide a description
of the resting cyst not investigated by Foissner et al. (2002).
The morphostatic specimens are highly similar to the Jordanian and Namibian populations
studied by Foissner et al. (2002). Size in vivo about 80–100 × 30–50 µm (n = 6). Bursiform to
slenderly bursiform with flattened oral area more or less curved ventrally; about 0.5:1 flattened
laterally; anterior third slightly contractile (Fig. 146a–d, f–l). Contractile vacuole subterminal in
ventral side. Right side cortex rather distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows. Cortical granules about
0.2 µm across, roughly in silverline pattern. Feeds on bacteria digested in food vacuoles about
7 µm across. Ciliary and silverline pattern (Fig. 146b, c) as described by Foissner et al. (2002).
Oral field elongate oblong, about 15 × 5 µm, paroral and adoral cilia about 6 µm long in vivo (Fig.
146e, m). A distinct fibre (?) associated with each paroral dikinetid extends into the buccal lip.
Resting cysts colourless and on average 35.6 µm in diameter (M = 36, SD = 1.4, SE = 0.4, CV
= 4.1, Min = 32, Max = 38, n = 13). Ectocyst membranous, polygonally faceted, 2–4 µm distant
from the about 1 µm thick, structureless endocyst followed by a dense layer of mitochondria.
Cytoplasm densely granulated, contains many globular and polymorphic lipid inclusions up to
15 µm in size (Fig. 143f, 146n–p). No slime cover, contractile vacuole and cilia not recognizable.
Cyrtophorida, Hymenostomata, Protostomatida, Peritrichia
Odontochlamys denticulata nov. spec. (Fig. 147a–d, 148a–h; Table 49)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 35 × 28 µm; very broadly ovate. Dorsal hump cog wheel-shaped.
Left ciliary field composed of 6 kineties; leftmost kinety comprising an average of 2 cilia.

Type locality: Venezuelan site (3), i. e., mosses from a roadside Laja (granitic rock-pool) and
from neighbouring trees of a tropical dry forest (Selva Veranera) about 150 km NE of Puerto
Ayacucho, 66°50’E 7°N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with 9 protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). All specimens
have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Denticulata (with very small teeth) is a Latin adjective and refers to the denticulated
dorsal hump.
Description: Size in vivo 28–40 × 22–34 µm, usually about 35 × 28 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 49 adding 15% preparation shrinkage;
length:width ratio rather stable, i. e., 1.1–1.4:1 with an average of 1.2:1 (Table 49). Broadly
ovate, left margin slightly concave at level of oral basket opening (Fig. 147a, 148b, c, g). Postoral
424

ventral region distinctly concave. Dorsal hump densely granulated, conspicuous because having
10–15 refractive processes forming a perfect cog wheel in the 15 live and protargol-impregnated
specimens observed; cogs also recognizable in protargol preparations (Fig. 147a, c, 148a, b,
c, f, h). Nuclear apparatus in middle third of cell and slightly left of midline (Fig. 147c, 148e–
g; Table 49). Macronucleus globular to almost ellipsoid, on average 11 × 8 µm after protargol
impregnation; nucleoli or chromatin bodies mainly in periphery, four out of 11 specimens with a
faintly impregnated globule in macronucleus centre. Several specimens with a large, fluffy body
posterior of macronucleus, possibly a nuclear anlage. Micronucleus 3–4 µm across, distinct in
vivo, faintly impregnated with protargol, usually 1–2 µm distant from macronucleus. Invariably
two contractile vacuoles in typical diagonal position and with an excretory pore each (Fig.
147a, b, 148a, e, g; Table 49). Cytoplasm hyaline, contains many granules 0.5–2 µm in size;
food vacuoles absent or not impregnated. Lively gliding on microscope slide and soil particles,
showing considerable flexibility.
Encysts very fast, as does O. gouraudi (Foissner 2011). Ontogenesis commences as in Chilodonella
uncinata, i. e., an anlage develops at right margin of right ciliary field.

Somatic and oral ciliature as described by Foissner (1988) in O. gouraudi, with the following
differences (Fig. 147b, d, 148e–g; Table 49): (i) fewer basal bodies (cilia), especially in leftmost
kinety of left ciliary field and (ii) fewer dorsal bristles (9 vs. 12–15). Dorsal brush along anterior
and left subapical margin of cell, bristles in vivo about 8 µm long with very fine distal half. At right
end of preoral kinety or anterior circumoral kinety a deeply impregnating granule (dikinetid?).
Oral basket inconspicuous because only 3 µm across and composed of nine thin rods.
Remarks: Foissner (1988b) discussed the problems associated with O. gouraudi, type of the
genus. In this species spines occur only in the posterior half of the dorsal hump. This has been found
in four studies (Certes 1891, Kahl 1931, wenZel 1953, Foissner 1988b) and in an unpublished
population from tanks of a Mexican bromeliad (Fig. 148i–m). Thus, it should be considered as
a constant feature, although there is a considerable variability in the size and distinctness of the
spines.
buitKaMP (1977a) described an African (Ivory Coast) population with a cog wheel-shaped dorsal
hump, matching the Venezuelan specimens. However, the African population has only five
(vs. six) ciliary rows in the left ciliary field and the leftmost kinety of this field is composed of
much more cilia than in the Venezuelan specimens (~ 15 vs. 1–4). Thus, we consider the African
population as a distinct species described below.
We consider the cog wheel-shaped dorsal hump as the main feature of the Venezuelan population,
i. e., of O. denticulata. This is supported by the evidence discussed above and by the following
side-features (Table 49): the number of oral basket rods (9 in O. denticulata vs. 12–15 in O.

gouraudi), the number of dorsal bristles (8 vs. 13), and the number of cilia in the leftmost kinety
of the left ciliary field (1–4 vs. 10–35). These differences are not size-related because the average
body size is very similar in O. denticulata (30 × 25 µm) and O. gouraudi (32 × 25 µm). Further,
the macronucleus is ellipsoid in O. gouraudi (12 × 6 µm), while broadly ellipsoidal to globular in
the Venezuelan (11 × 8 µm; Table 49) and African (buitKaMP 1977a) populations.

Odontochlamys buitkampi nov. spec. (Fig. 147e, f)
Diagnosis: Length (in vivo?) 20–22 µm; very broadly reniform. Dorsal hump cog wheel-shaped.
Left ciliary field composed of 5 kineties; leftmost kinety with > 10 cilia.
Type locality: Soil from the surroundings of the town of Sangrobo, Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire),
6°N 4°50’W.
Type material: Slide(s) with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited at the Institut
für Landwirtschaftliche Zoologie, Universität Bonn (buitKaMP 1977a).
Dedication: We dedicate this species to Dr. Ulrich buitKaMP (Germany), the discoverer.
Description: See buitKaMP (1977a) and the diagnoses of O. buitkampi and of→ O. denticulata.
Cinetochilides nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Cinetochilidae (?) with kinetids membrane-like polymerized in anterior quarter of
somatic kineties 1 and 2. Two rounds of basal body production between paroral membrane and
kinety 1 generate, together with the scutica, the paroral membrane and the adoral membranelles
of the opisthe; protomembranelle 1 elongated and sigmoid, its right third very likely incorporated
into paroral membrane. The second round produces the new scutica for proter and opisthe.
Type species: Cinetochilides terricola nov. spec.
Etymology: Cinetochilides is a composite of the genus-group name Cinetochilum and the Greek
suffix -ides (similar, especially in shape), referring to the similarity with Cinetochilum. Masculine
gender.
Species assignable: Cinetochilides terricola nov. spec. (type); C. monomacronucleatus nov. spec.;
C. australiensis (Foissner et al., 1994) nov. comb. (basionym: Cinetochilum australiense Foissner
et al., 1994; for the homonym Cinetochilum marinum PoMP & wilbert, 1988; if Cinetochilum
marinum Kahl, 1931 is a member of the genus Cinetochilides, the species name given by PoMP
& wilbert (1988) should be activated: Cinetochilides marinus); and Cinetochilides ovale (gong
& song, 2008) nov. comb. (basionym: Cinetochilum ovale gong & song, 1988).
The species transferred to Cinetochilides match the morphostatic morphology of C. terricola,
i. e., all have polymerized kinetids in the anterior portion of somatic kineties 1 and 2 while
Cinetochilum margaritaceum, type of the genus (aesCht 2001), lacks such a distinct condensation
(Foissner et al. 1994, gelei 1940, PuytoraC et al. 1974). Unfortunately, ontogenetic data are not
available for the species transferred.
Remarks: We establish the genus Cinetochilides with a morphostatic (polymerization of anterior
kinetids in kineties 1 and 2) and two ontogenetic (two rounds of basal body production along
the paroral membrane; protomembranelle 1 elongated and sigmoid) features. A distinct kinetid
polymerization is absent from Cinetochilum margaritaceum, type of the genus (Fig. 152a, b;
aesCht 2001, Foissner et al. 1994, gelei 1940, PuytoraC et al. 1974). The ontogenesis of C.
429

margaritaceum has been studied by PuytoraC et al. (1974). There is neither an elongated, sigmoid
protomembranelle 1 or a second round of basal body production along the paroral membrane.
Thus, a generic separation of Cinetochilum margaritaceum and Cinetochilides terricola is
appropriate.
The molecular data show that Cinetochilides ovalis makes a clade with Platynematum salinarum
(Foissner et al. 2013). Very likely, Cinetochilides terricola belongs to this clade because it has the
same peculiarities in protomembranelle 1 (cp. Fig. 149h, i). Unfortunately, a molecular sequence
is not available from Cinetochilum margaritaceum.
Cinetochilides terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 149a–h, j–x, 150k–w, 151a–f, 152a–c;

Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 27 × 23 µm; broadly ellipsoid. 2 globular macronuclear nodules;
extrusomes cuneate, about 3 µm long. 11 ciliary rows with several caudal cilia 15–20 µm long
in vivo; 4 preoral dikinetids in specific pattern. Oral apparatus extends to 63% of body length on
average; oral opening roughly triangular; adoral membranelles each composed of 3 rows of basal

Type locality: Galápagos site (68), i. e., saline soil (~ 30‰) from the surroundings of the village
of Puerto Villamil, south coast of Isabela Island, 0°57’S 90°57’W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 5 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated morphostatic and
dividing specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant morphostatic and dividing specimens have been
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin species-group name terricola (living in soil) refers to the habitat the
species was discovered.
Description: Size in vivo 24–30 × 20–26 µm, usually about 27 × 23 µm, as calculated from some
live measurements and the morphometric data in Table 50 adding 20% preparation shrinkage
due to ethanol fixation. Body shape inconspicuous, i. e., broadly ellipsoid or slightly ovate or
obovate, preorally distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows (Fig. 149a, b, 150l, o; Table 50); laterally
431

flattened about 2:1. Macronuclear nodules in or slightly posterior to mid-body and in or near
body´s midline, side by side or one upon the other (Fig. 150), globular to broadly elliptic (Fig.
149a, c, 150m, o, q, t, w; Table 50); one of 100 randomly selected specimens with only one
nodule. Micronucleus (ei?) not impregnated with the protargol method used, not even in dividers.
Contractile vacuole in posterior end in body´s midline or slightly neighbored ventral side, excretory
pore not impregnated; contracts rarely, very likely due to the high salt concentration (Fig. 149a).
Extrusomes within ciliary rows, crenelate cortex because slightly protruding, oriented obliquely
to transverse axis of cell, slenderly cuneate with broad end attached to cortex, in vivo about 3
× 0.5 µm in size (Fig. 149a, d, 150k, n, s). Cytoplasm colourless, contains one to three bright
crystals of various shape and 1–3 µm in size, and few to many food vacuoles 3–4 µm across and
studded with minute bacteria (Fig. 149a, 150k, m, n). Glides rather rapidly on microscope slides
and bottom of culture dishes; swims clumsily.
Cilia in vivo 6–8 µm long, arranged in eleven ordinarily and equidistantly spaced rows extending
in deep furrows and following body contour, i. e., curved on ventral and left side while slightly
oblique on right (Fig. 149a–c, g, 150k, l, o–r, w; Table 50). Most ciliary rows bipolar anteriorly
leaving blank an obovate area; all begin with a dikinetid having ciliated only the posterior basal
body except of SKn–1 and SKn–2 each commencing with two ciliated “preoral” dikinetids widely
spaced in SKn–1. Cilia more widely spaced in posterior region of rows, about five modified to
15–20 µm long caudal cilia difficult to recognize because beating rather rapidly and very fine
in distal half. Anterior region of kineties 1 and 2 each with about 10 very narrowly spaced cilia
forming a membrane-like structure. Two, occasionally possibly three minute postoral kineties
each composed of three to four kinetids between SKn and proximal end of paroral membrane.
Kinety SKn extends along posterior half of left mouth margin, composed of an average of eight
kinetids forming two or three dikinetids anteriorly (Fig. 149a–c, g, 150k, l, o–t, w; Table 50).
Oral apparatus in mid-body, oral opening roughly triangular (Fig. 149a, b, g, 150k, m, o, p,
r; Table 50). Three minute adoral membranelles each composed of three rows of basal bodies
with about 5 µm long cilia in vivo. Membranelle 1 longest, slightly convex, anterior row of
basal bodies slightly shortened at left end. Membranelle 2 slightly shorter than membranelle
1, separated by a minute cleft in a long left and a short right portion. Membranelle 3 roughly
quadrangular, composed of six or nine basal bodies. Paroral membrane distinctly curved, likely
composed of dikinetids but usually appears as a single row of basal bodies. Scutica extends along
proximal region of paroral membrane, composed of two short rows of basal bodies (Fig. 149a, b,
g, 150k, m, o, p, r; Table 50).
Ontogenesis (Fig. 149e–h, j–x, 150u, v, 151a–f): The preparations do not show the structure of
the paroral membrane with sufficient clarity. Thus, we show it as a single row of basal bodies
throughout although it is very likely dikinetal in some stages. Likewise, the adoral membranelles
are too unclear. Thus, we show them as black bars; very likely, there is some internal reorganization.
Cinetochilides terricola has a complex ontogenesis. The earliest stage observed shows disordered
basal bodies right of the paroral membrane and a distinct growth of the postoral kineties and SKn
(Fig. 149e). Next, the scutica, the basal bodies right of the paroral membrane, and possibly also
some postoral basal bodies produce three protomembranelles each composed of two rows of basal

Fig. 149j–o. Cinetochilides terricola, ventral and ventrolateral views of protargol-impregnated dividers. j, k: The paroral
membrane of the opisthe is generated very likely from two sources: the right third of protomembranelle 1 and from the kinetids
right of the proter paroral membrane (Fig. 149h, i) because these kinetids disappeared leaving a blank stripe between the parental
paroral and kinety 1. Note also the accumulation of kinetids left of the new adoral membranelles. l, m, u: A new kinety, very likely
the later scutica, is generated right of the paroral membrane of proter and opisthe. The kinetids left of the adoral membranelles
organize to postoral kineties and a new somatic kinety n (SKn). The macronuclear nodules are slightly swollen (u, on next page).
n, o, v: The new scutica, the new postoral kineties, and the new SKn are now well recognizable. The macronuclear nodules have
elongated (v, on next page) and the division furrow becomes recognizable. AM – adoral membranelles, PE – protomembranelles,

bodies (Fig. 149f, h, 150v). Protomembranelle 1 is distinctly longer than protomembranelles 2
and 3 and slightly sigmoid, a highly characteristic feature found also in Platynematum (Fig. 149i).
Next, the opisthe paroral membrane is generated and the adoral membranelles become three-
rowed (Fig. 149j, k, 151a). The paroral is built from basal bodies right of the parental paroral and,
very likely as in Platynematum (Fig. 149i), from the right portion of protomembranelle 1 whose

length distinctly decreased. In this stage, all basal bodies disappear right of the parental paroral,
respectively, have been used to build the oral structures of the opisthe (Fig. 149j, k, 151a). In late
early dividers, a second round of basal body production occurs along the parental (proter) paroral
membrane and a first round along the new paroral of the opisthe (Fig. 149l, 150u, 151b). These
basal bodies become a new scutica in proter and opisthe (Fig. 149m, n, 151c, d). Concomitantly,
new postoral kineties and many somatic kinetids are generated and the macronuclear nodules

Fig. 151a–f. Cinetochilides terricola, protargol-impregnated dividers. a: An early mid-divider having assembled the opisthe
paroral membrane from kinetids between the proter paroral and somatic kinety 1 and the right third of protomembranelle 1,
and thus there are no kinetids between paroral and kinety 1 of the proter, in contrast to a slightly earlier stage (Fig. 150v). The
protomembranelles each consist of two rows of basal bodies. b: Slightly later than the stage shown in (a) because the adoral
membranelles are composed of three rows of basal bodies, as in morphostatic specimens. A new scutica (arrowheads) has been
generated between paroral membrane and somatic kinety 1 both in proter and opisthe. c: An early mid-divider with swollen
macronuclear nodules and distinct scutica in proter and opisthe. d, e: Mid-dividers with elongated macronuclear nodules and
beginning cytokinesis. The oral apparatus has been completed in both proter and opisthe, and the paroral membrane very likely
became dikinetal (e). f: A late divider, showing that the four preoral dikinetids belong to somatic kineties SKn-1 and SKn-2. MA
– macronuclear nodules, PK – postoral kineties, PM – paroral membrane, SKn – last somatic kinety, SKn-1, SKn-2 – penultimate
somatic kineties, SK1, 2 – ordinary somatic kineties, ST – scutica, 1, 2, 3 – adoral membranelles. Scale bars 15 µm.
Mid-dividers elongate the macronuclear nodules and organize details of the new infraciliature,
especially SKn and SKn-1 (Fig. 149n, 151d, e). In early late dividers, these processes continue
and cytokinesis commences (Fig. 149o, w, 151e). Late dividers have a deep division furrow and
have divided the macronuclear nodules (Fig. 149p, x, 151f). Very late dividers are globular and

Fig. 152a–c. Cinetochilum margaritaceum, protargol-impregnated specimens from the Amper River in Bavaria. Figures (b, c)
show both sides of a single specimen. Cinetochilum margaritaceum differs from Cinetochilides terricola by many features: one
vs. two macronuclear nodules; oral apparatus distinctly vs. slightly posterior to mid-body; 15–18 vs. 11 somatic ciliary rows;
somatic kineties 1 and 2 indistinct vs. with distinct polymerization of kinetids anteriorly; somatic kineties distinctly shortened vs.
unshortened posteriorly; without vs. with four preoral dikinetids. AM1 – adoral membranelle 1, DI – dikinetid on anterior end of
all ciliary rows, MA – macronucleus, PM – paroral membrane, SK1, 2 – somatic kineties, ST – scutica. Scale bars 10 µm (a) and
15 µm (b, c).
organize the four preoral dikinetids (Fig. 149q, r). Early post- dividers look like morphostatic
cells but are slightly smaller (Fig. 149s, t).
Remarks: There are three similar species to compare with C. terricola: Cinetochilum marinum
Kahl, 1931; C. australiense Foissner et al., 1994 (for the homonym C. marinum PoMP & wilbert,
1988); and C. ovale gong & song, 2008. The two last-mentioned species have been transferred to
Cinetochilides above. The following comparison excludes extrusomes (not described but likely
present in the three species mentioned) and caudal cilia (difficult to observe).
Cinetochilum marinum has been not yet investigated with modern methods making a sound
comparison difficult. It differs from → Cinetochilides terricola by body shape (slightly triangular
vs. broadly elliptic); the macronucleus (one vs. two nodules); the location of the oral apparatus
(in posterior body half vs. slightly posterior to mid-body); and the caudal cilia (short vs. about 15
µm; but see above).
Cinetochilides australiense differs from C. terricola by body shape (sharply notched posteriorly
in body´s midline vs. smoothly rounded); the absence (vs. presence) of isolated preoral dikinetids;
and the absence (vs. presence) of caudal cilia (but see above). Obviously these species are rather
similar.
Cinetochilides ovale differs from C. terricola by the macronucleus (one vs. two nodules); the
shape of the oral opening (ellipsoid vs. roughly triangular); the structure of adoral membranelle
1 (composed of two vs. three rows of basal bodies); and the pattern of preoral dikinetids (two
dikinetids in an oblique vs. vertical row and dikinetids on begin of SKn-1 side by side vs. one
after the other).
439

Cinetochilides monomacronucleatus nov. spec. (Fig. 150a–h; Table 50)
Diagnosis: As Cinetochilides terricola but with only 1 macronuclear nodule.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (65), i. e., highly saline (~ 50‰) coastal soil from the surroundings
of the village of Chichirivice, Morrocoy National Park, 67°13’W 11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 5 paratype slides with protargol- and silver nitrate-impregnated
specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz
(LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the Greek numeral mono (single), the Greek
adjective macros (large), and the Latin noun nucleus (nucleus), referring to the single macronuclear
nodule characterizing this species.
Description: We do not provide a conventional description because C. monomacronucleatus is
indistinguishable from → C. terricola except of the single (vs. two) macronuclear nodule (Fig.
150a–h; Table 50).
In vivo C. monomacronucleatus has a size about 15–25 × 10–20 µm while it is slightly smaller
than → C. terricola in the protargol preparations; this, of course, also influences the distances
measured (Table 50). A single micronucleus is attached to the globular macronucleus and about
1 µm in size. The food vacuoles contain minute (~ 1 µm) bacteria. The ordinary somatic cilia are
6–7 µm long while the caudal cilia are about 15 µm long in vivo.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Occurs, according to live observations,
also in Namibia (dune 45 at road to Sossus Vlei; not saline; Foissner et al. 2002) and in Australia
(highly saline mangrove soil in the surroundings of the town of Cairns).
Remarks: There are two similar species, i. e., with one macronuclear nodule: Cinetochilum
marinum Kahl, 1931 and Cinetochilides ovale (gong & song, 2008). The following comparison
excludes extrusomes (not described but likely present in the species mentioned) and caudal cilia
(difficult to observe).
Cinetochilum marinum has been not yet investigated with modern methods making a reliable
comparison difficult. It differs from Cinetochilides monomacronucleatus by body outline
(triangular vs. broadly elliptic); the location of the oral apparatus (in posterior body half vs.
slightly posterior to mid-body); and the caudal cilia (short vs. about 15 µm long; but see above).
Cinetochilides ovale differs from C. monomacronucleatus by the shape of the oral opening
(ellipsoid vs. roughly triangular); the structure of adoral membranelle 1 (composed of two vs.
three rows of basal bodies); and the pattern of preoral dikinetids (two dikinetids in an oblique vs.
vertical row and dikinetids on begin of SKn-1 side by side vs. one after the other).
440

Platynematum terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 153a–h, 154a–g; Table 51)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 33 × 19 µm. Body slightly ovate, inconspicuously to up to 2:1
flattened laterally; frontal plate obovate. Nuclear apparatus posterior to mid-body. Contractile
vacuole subterminal with excretory pore between kineties 2 and 3. Extrusomes, very likely a
sort of trichocysts, within ciliary rows, cuneate, 2–3 µm long. Cortex thick, with distinct ciliary
pits. On average 18 ciliary rows most commencing with two ciliated dikinetids; Kn–1 without
dikinetids; a single caudal cilium about as long as body. Oral apparatus distinctly subapical,
tetrahymenid.
Type locality: Soil surrounding roots of bulbs from Prospero, Antalya, Cakilli Gecidi, about 11
km SE of the town of Cevizli, 1200 NN, Anatolia, Turkey, 31°45’O 37°45’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin species-group name terricola (living in soil) refers to the habitat the
species was discovered.
Description: Size in vivo 25–40 × 15–23 µm, usually about 33 × 19 µm, as calculated from
measurements of live and prepared specimens adding 15% for preparation shrinkage (Table 51).
Shape slightly ovate with a shallow concavity in mouth area, laterally slightly to distinctly (~ 2:1)
flattened, frontal plate obovate and easily recognizable (Fig. 153a–e, 154c, g); spines or notches
definitely absent. Nuclear apparatus posterior to mid-body, without peculiarities (Fig. 153a, c, e,
154b, c, e; Table 51). Macronucleus globular, finely granulated and about 7 µm across in vivo.
Micronucleus about 1.5 µm across, attached to macronucleus. Contractile vacuole subterminal, i.
e., on average 6 µm distant from posterior pole; excretory pore with long, oblique canal opening
between kineties 2 and 3 (Fig. 153a, b, 154b; Table 51). Extrusomes numerous, very likely a
kind of trichocysts, most within ciliary rows, cuneate, 2–3 µm long, impregnate lightly with the
protargol method used (Fig. 153a, f, h, 154d, f, g). Cortex about 1 µm thick, ciliary pits distinct,
without conspicuous ridges (Fig. 153a, h, 154e). Cytoplasm colourless, specimens, however,
dark at low magnification (≤ ×100) because usually studded with ring-shaped granules, especially
in anterior half; individual granules with minute to wide central hole, moderately refractive,
globular to broadly ellipsoid, about 1 µm in size, dissolve during protargol impregnation (Fig.
153a, h, 154a, b, e). Most food vacuoles in middle body third, 3–5 µm across in vivo, contain
bacteria and their spores. Swims rapidly and incessantly rotating about main body axis.
Somatic cilia in vivo about 7 µm long. Caudal cilium in centre of pole, about as long as body,
proximal thirds as thick as somatic cilia, distal third very fine and more or less curved (Fig.
153a, b, 154a). On average 18 meridional, equidistant, basically monokinetal ciliary rows most
commencing posterior of frontal plate and ending in posterior pole area (Fig. 153a–c, e, g,
154c, d, g; Table 51). Kinety 1 commences with about three dikinetids posterior and right of
paroral membrane. Kinety 2 slightly shortened anteriorly, commences with six narrowly spaced,
ciliated basal bodies and then extends right of paroral membrane to rear body end. Kineties 3–16

at level of second adoral membranelle, monokinetal throughout. Kinety 18 commences at
posterior margin of buccal cavity with one or two dikinetids. Scutica along and posterior of
buccal vertex, composed of 8–11 basal bodies, most as dikinetids (Fig. 153a–c, e, g, 154 c, d, g;
Table 51).
Oral apparatus in a shallow, subapical concavity with paroral membrane extending to 40% of body
length in protargol preparations; structure and shape tetrahymenid (Fig. 153a, b, d, g, 154a–e, g;
Table 51). Oral opening triangular, paroral membrane moderately curved, composed of about 15
narrowly spaced dikinetids in zigzag pattern; proximal third associated with lightly impregnated
oral ribs, forming a distinct pharynx extending obliquely to mid-body. Adoral membranelles
short and thick, each likely composed of three rows of basal bodies, details slightly variable and
difficult to recognize; some scattered basal bodies right of membranelle 2 (Fig. 153a, b, d, g, 154
c, d, g; Table 51).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in Turkey (type locality); Indonesia; Venezuelan sample
(4), i. e., in the mud of a lithotelma; and in the Pantanal, Brazil. Thus, it is possibly a cosmopolitan.
Remarks: Platynematum terricola is highly similar to P. salinarum recently described by
Foissner et al. (2013) from a hypersaline (~ 120‰) solar saltern in Portugal. Actually, there are
only two clearly different features: the number of ciliary rows (17–18 vs. 21–22) which is very
stable in both populations (CV < 5%), and the absence (vs. presence) of dikinetids in the anterior
third of kinety n–1. Very likely, the extrusomes are also different but they could be not seen in P.
salinarum. Furthermore, the Portuguese specimens lack the prominent cytoplasmic inclusions of
the Turkish cells; however, this could be caused by the very different habitats.
444

According to the molecular data, Platynematum belongs to the Cinetochilidae which, however,
are paraphyletic (Foissner et al. 2014a).
Tetrahymena rostrata (Kahl, 1926) Corliss, 1952 (Fig. 155a–m; Table 52)
Material: Over the years, we studied this species from a variety of terrestrial habitats globally.
Tetrahymena rostrata is not easily identified because its life cycle includes slender, fast-swimming
theronts and broad, ordinarily swimming trophonts. Further, the short caudal cilium (~ 15 µm,

observation with a high power oil immersion objective. Last but not least, the resting cyst should
be checked because it has a peculiar nuclear pattern not described from any other Tetrahymena
species.
Here, we mention observations from the following sites: Austria (Burgenland, grassland soil from
the Seewinkel National Park; detailed site and species description in Foissner 1987); Austria
(Salzburg, soil from alpine grassland in the Gastein area; observations on life cycle Foissner
1987, site description in Peer & Foissner 1985); USA (soil from the Arizona Desert; resting cyst
from life but nuclear apparatus not checked); Africa (floodplain soil from the Bukaos River in
Namibia, site 64 in Foissner et al. 2002; resting cyst from life and after methyl green-pyronin
staining, Fig. 155d, e, j–m), and Venezuelan site 61 (rain forest soil; live observation and protargol
impregnation of recently excysted specimens, Fig. 155b, f–i; four voucher slides deposited in the

e., not composed of a single but of two macronuclear nodules and a single, about 3 µm-sized
micronucleus in between or near to the nodules (Fig. 155b, f–h; Table 52). The binucleate state
447

is taken over from the resting cyst, suggesting that 73% of the specimens have recently excysted.
Resting cyst: Resting cysts were observed in populations from the USA, Namibia, Venezuela,
and Austria. They are very similar in shape (globular), size (about 30 µm), and wall (smooth, thin,
and colourless).
In the USA population, the cysts are globular with an average diameter of 28.3 µm (M = 28, SD
= 3.4, SE = 0.7, CV = 12.0, Min = 20.0, Max = 32, n = 23). The cyst wall is smooth, about 1.4
µm thick, and colourless. The cytoplasm is studded with (lipid?) globules up to 5 µm across,
providing the cyst with a yellow tint. The cysts of the Namibian specimens are globular with an
average size of 30.8 × 30.1 µm (length/width: M = 30.5/30.0, SD = 2.2/1.7, SE = 0.5/0.4, CV =
7.0/5.7, Min = 27.0/27.0, Max = 35/33, n = 16/16). The cyst wall is smooth; 1.0–1.5 µm thick; and
composed of two very thin, compact layers separated by a bright sheet. The cytoplasm is studded
with colourless (lipid?) globules up to 2 µm across. The nuclear apparatus consists of two, rarely
of three or more scattered macronuclear nodules with a single micronucleus in between or near
to the nodules (Fig. 155d, e, j–m). Very recently, we checked an Austrian population for the cyst
morphology. It is highly similar to that from Namibia.
Family Urotrichidae sMall & lynn, 1985
Improved diagnosis: Prostomatida with comparatively short oral flaps (palps) and continuous
circumoral kinety. Adoral membranelles oriented more or less obliquely and inserted in anterior
region of somatic ciliature; arranged one after the other, i. e., along main body axis. Oral basket
complete and thus distinct. Somatic ciliary rows posteriorly shortened by 10–20%. Cortical
alveoli and/or silverlines in Urotricha or Parurotricha pattern, i. e., quadrangular meshes or
tetrahymenid.
Type genus: Urotricha ClaParède & laChMann, 1859.
Remarks: Many urotrichs and plagiocampids are small and thus difficult to investigate. Instead
of an extensive discussion, we provide improved diagnoses and semischematic illustrations for
distinguishing urotrichids from plagiocampids as well as for the plagiocampid genera (Fig. 156).
Our main characteristics (oral flaps, location of adoral membranelles) include the cortical alveoli
because they appear of considerable discriminatory value, although they are not known from all
genera. The same applies to the silverline pattern, which is quite different to the alveolar pattern
in some genera.
Looking at the scheme (Fig. 156) and the diagnoses, it becomes obvious that lynn (2008)
misclassified the urotrichid genus Parurotricha Foissner, 1983 in the Plagiocampidae.
Family Plagiocampidae Kahl, 1926
Improved diagnosis: Prostomatida with short or long oral flaps (palps). Circumoral kinety
interrupted by adoral membranelles (brosse) side by side, i. e., oriented transversely to main body
axis. Oral basket indistinct because basket rods lacking at brosse site. Somatic ciliary rows not or
only slightly (≤ 10%) shortened posteriorly. Cortical alveoli in Plagiocampa pattern or forming
minute polygonal meshes.

life. a, e: Overviews of representative specimens, length 25 µm and 30 µm. These species differ, inter alia, by
the oral flaps (± motionless vs. beating up and down); the oral basket (funnel-shaped with extrusomes vs. bowl-
shaped without extrusomes); and the somatic extrusomes (absent vs. present). b: A specimen having ingested an

CC – caudal cilia, E – extrusomes, OF – oral flaps. Scale bars 15 µm.
Type genus: Plagiocampa sChewiaKoFF, 1893.
Remarks: As yet, this family was insufficiently separated from the Urotrichidae diagnosed above
(Foissner & PFister 1997, lynn 2008). The discovery of a new plagiocampid genus is a good
opportunity to clarify this matter by improving the diagnoses of the families and of the four
plagiocampid genera.
Genus Plagiocampa sChewiaKoFF, 1893
Improved diagnosis: Plagiocampidae with oral flaps beating up and down the oral opening.

The arrow marks the brosse side. The arrowheads denote the dikinetid at the anterior end of the ciliary rows. i, p,
q: Ventral view of paratype specimens, showing the inconspicuous brosse (asterisks) and a cell with three caudal
cilia. The excretory pore of the contractile vacuole and one of the two caudal cilia are not recognizable at this focal
plan but appear when the focus is near cell centre (q). j–l: Structure of the adoral membranelles (brosse): 95% of
the specimens have the pattern shown in (j), while (k) and (l) are very rare. m, r: Anterior and posterior polar view,
showing the organization of the oral and somatic ciliature. Posteriorly, the ciliary rows end at slightly different level.
Thus, the cilia do not form a perfect circle, in contrast to the circumoral kinety which, however, is interrupted by the
adoral membranelles (numerals 1, 2, 3). n: A slender specimen without large food vacuoles, resembling Urotricha
farcta. o: The cortex forms large blisters under slight coverslip pressure (see Fig. 158g). CC – caudal cilia, CK –
circumoral kinety, E – extrusomes, EP – excretory pore of contractile vacuole, MI – micronucleus, NU – nucleolus
of macronucleus, OB – oral basket, OF – oral flaps. Scale bars 5 µm (m, r) and 10 µm (g–i, p, q).
Remarks: The most remarkable features of Plagiocampa are the oral flaps, which beat up and
down the mouth opening, and the distinct difference between cortical and silverline pattern (Fig.
156).
451

Genus Chilophrya Kahl, 1930a
At the present state of knowledge, Chilophrya cannot be distinguished unambiguously from
Plagiocampa. Foissner (1984) described in detail a terrestrial Chilophrya species but the generic
assignment remained doubtful. The terrestrial species is similar to Plagiocampa but has a different
silverline pattern and extrusomes with anchors, like the microthoracids.
Genus Plagiocampides Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002
Improved diagnosis: Plagiocampidae with long oral flaps not beating up and down the oral
opening. Cortical alveoli minute and polygonal.
Type species: Plagiocampides halophilus Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002.
Remarks: Both, the cortical alveoli and the silverline pattern are markedly different from those
of the congeners (Fig. 156), emphasizing the uniqueness of the type species.
Protoplagiocampa nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Plagiocampidae with short oral flaps not beating up and down the oral opening.
Cortical alveoli in Plagiocampa pattern.
Type species: Protoplagiocampa lajacola nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix proto (coming first) and the generic name
Plagiocampa, supposing that Plagiocampa evolved from Protoplagiocampa. Feminine gender.
Remarks: We put together the features distinguishing the plagiocampid genera in Fig. 156,
showing that Protoplagiocampa has minute, urotrichid oral flaps while the adoral membranelles
are plagiocampid.
Protoplagiocampa lajacola nov. spec. (Fig. 157a–r, 158a–v, 159a–g; Table 53)
Diagnosis: Size about 25 × 15 µm in vivo. Shape usually broadly ellipsoid, overfed specimens
broadly ovate. 1 macronucleus and 1 micronucleus. Extrusomes mainly within oral basket, 3–4
µm long rods with narrowed ends. On average 17 ciliary rows commencing subapically with a
dikinetid and ending in posterior pole area; 2 caudal cilia 20–25 µm long. On average 6 circumoral
dikinetids associated with 2–3 µm high oral flaps and nematodesmata, forming a comparatively
distinct oral basket. 3 adoral membranelles composed of 2, 2 and 1 kinetid, respectively.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (30), viz., mud and soil from ephemeral puddles (Lajas) on granitic
outcroppings between the Agricultural Research Institute and the airport of Pto. Ayacucho,
67°36‘W 5°41‘N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens as well

as 1 and 5 paratype slides with Chatton-lwoFF and Klein-Foissner silver nitrate-impregnated
specimens, respectively, have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI). Further, we deposited at the same locality 2 voucher slides with specimens
from Venezuelan site (12). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip.
Etymology: The name is a composite of Laja (ephemeral puddles on granitic outcroppings) and
the Latin verb colere (to live in), the habitat the species was discovered.
Description: This species impregnated poorly with silver nitrate while excellently with protargol,
making it possible to study the finest details. Many features have a rather high (CV near 20%)
variability (Table 53). This is associated with feeding: specimens with many food vacuoles are
distinctly larger than starving cells. We could not decide whether large cells develop when food
is abundant or small specimens become expanded when strongly fed; macrostome formation does
not occur.
Size 15–35 × 9–27 µm in vivo, usually about 25 × 15 µm (Table 53); not contractile. Body shape
and length:width ratio (1.3–2.6:1, on average 1.7:1) highly variable, depending on amount of food
ingested: usually ellipsoid (Fig. 157a, b, g, h, q, 158b, f, n, o) to indistinctly ovate (Fig. 157p);
narrowly ellipsoid and indistinctly pentagonal with narrowed, slightly projecting oral area when
starving (Fig. 157n); broadly ovate with bluntly acute oral area when overfed (Fig. 157i); slightly
asymmetrical because anterior shoulder more pronounced on brosse side (Fig. 157n). Nuclear
apparatus in or near body centre. Macronucleus broadly ellipsoid to globular, in vivo about 7 µm
across and with pale, up to 3 µm-sized nucleoli, making it pustulate in protargol preparations
457

due to shrinkage processes. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, about 1.2 µm in protargol
preparations (Fig. 157a, h, q, 158o, 159a, d; Table 53). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end
slightly out of pole centre, with single excretory pore (Fig. 157a, h, i, q, r). Mature extrusomes
only within oral basket, impregnate deeply with silver carbonate but not with protargol; slightly
curved, 3–4 µm long, ends slightly narrowed (Fig. 157a, c, 159a, b); somatic extrusomes absent.
Cortex very flexible, rather thick, of Plagiocampa structure, according to the silver nitrate
preparations (Fig. 158h, i); easily separates from cytoplasm under slight coverslip pressure,
forming large blisters showing ciliary imprints (Fig. 157o, 158c, g). Cytoplasm colourless, often
contains many lipid droplets up to 2 µm across. Feeds on small ciliates, flagellates, and an 8 µm
long green alga; a greedy predator containing up to six partially digested Apocyclidium terricola
(30–40 µm long!) because prey is partially or completely lysed at mouth entrance (Fig. 158p,
159g); rarely cannebalistic (Fig. 159c). Swims in wide spirals and glides rapidly and upright, i.
e., with the mouth directed to microscope slide.
Somatic cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 17 longitudinal, equidistant
rows commencing subapically with a dikinetid and ending in posterior pole region; unciliated
posterior pole area thus indistinct; each kinety with an average of 12 cilia. Two to four, usually
two caudal cilia slightly displaced dorsally; conspicuous because 20–25 µm long in vivo and
beating slowly; distal half very fine and thus not preserved in protargol preparations (Fig. 157a,
g–i, n, p–r, 158a–f, n, o, s, 159a, e, f; Table 53).
Oral opening in centre of anterior pole, occupying about 22% of body width, limited by circumoral
kinety composed of an average of six dikinetids each associated with a 2–3 µm high ciliary stump,
forming an oral flap not beating up and down. Oral basket inconspicuous in vivo and protargol
preparations, funnel-shaped, extends to mid-body, contains extrusomes as described above.
Adoral membranelles (brosse) on anterior end of three somatic ciliary rows, intersect circumoral
kinety, minute, i. e., membranelles 1 and 2 each composed of two minute cilia, membranelle 3
of only one basal body; some variation occurs (Fig. 157a, d, g–n, p–r158, f, g, k–v, 159a, d, f;
Table 53).
Ecology and Occurrence: Common in Lajas (lithotelmas) of Venezuela; one record from
savannah soil. Protoplagiocampa lajacola reproduced rapidly and became abundant in the non-
flooded Petri dish culture, feeding mainly on the slightly larger Apocyclidium terricola, which is
partially or completely lysed at the mouth entrance (Fig. 158p, 159g).
Remarks: Protoplagiocampa lajacola is a minute ciliate not easily identified. In vivo, the best
feature is probably the extrusomes within the oral basket and the two caudal cilia. In protargol
preparations, the unique structure of the brosse, the two caudal cilia, and the main morphometrics
should produce a safe identification.
There are two Plagiocampa species with which P. lajacola can be mixed because they have a
similar size and shape and two caudal cilia. Plagiocampa pentadactyla Foissner et al., 2002 has
a rather distinct subapical shoulder, making the outline pentagonal (Fig. 157e). Further, it has 2
µm long somatic extrusomes (Fig. 157f) while P. lajacola has 3–4 µm long oral extrusomes (Fig.
157a, c). Plagiocampa namibiensis Foissner et al., 2002 is ovate, has somatic extrusomes, and
458

possesses only 6 (vs. 12) cilia in the somatic kineties. There are also similar Urotricha species, e.
g., U. furcata, which, however, lack cilia in the posterior quarter (Foissner et al. 1999).
Plagiocampa monotricha nov. spec. (Fig. 160a–l; Table 54)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 35 × 25 µm; broadly ellipsoid. Oral extrusomes slightly fusiform,
about 5 × 0.4 µm in size; somatic extrusomes about 1 µm long. 1 caudal cilium. On average 24
ciliary rows and 17 oral dikinetids (flaps).
Type locality: Venezuelan site (52), i. e., upper soil layer of a gallery forest some km south of the
village of Choroni, 67°37’ W 10°30’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI).

Etymology: The Latinized Greek adjective monotricha (one hair) refers to the single caudal
cilium, a main character of this species.
Description: Size in vivo 30–45 × 20–30 µm, usually about 35 × 25 µm as calculated from some
live measurements and the morphometric data in Table 54 adding 15% preparation shrinkage;
slightly to up to 2:1 flattened laterally. Shape ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid, bluntly ovate when
full of food (Fig. 160c–e, g, j–l; Table 54). Nuclear apparatus in or near body centre, may be
dislocated by large food vacuoles (Fig. 160c–e, j–l; Table 54). Macronucleus globular to broadly
ellipsoid, contains many large nucleoli. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, about 2 µm
across. Excretory pore of contractile vacuole on ventral side subterminal at boarder of ciliated/
non-ciliated body portion (Fig. 160c, e). Cortex flexible, glossy; contains many minute, about
1 µm long extrusomes within ciliary rows, do not impregnate with the protargol method used
(Fig. 160b, c, i). Mature oral extrusomes mainly around oral basket, slightly fusiform and about
5 × 0.4 µm in size (Fig. 160a, c, g, j–l), do not impregnate with protargol; 3 µm long, wrinkled
extrusome precursors scattered throughout cytoplasm, impregnate deeply with protargol (Fig.
160d, e, j–l). Cytoplasm hyaline, glossy, usually contains some lipid droplets up to 2 µm across
and one or two up to 12 µm-sized food vacuoles with Protocyclidium terricola, possibly the
preferred food (Fig. 160a, l). Swims rapidly frequently changing direction.
Somatic cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, intrakinetal distances gradually increase strongly from
anterior to posterior; caudal cilium about half body length, fragile and frequently shed when
cells are immobilized by coverslip pressure. On average 24 ciliary rows, extend meridionally and
equidistantly, commence posterior of oral opening with a ciliated dikinetid; slightly shortened

Oral opening occupies anterior body end, almost entirely surrounded by circumoral dikinetids
associated with an average of 17 flaps beating up and down, producing a digitate (undulating)
membrane; individual flaps composed of two glued cilia, slightly conical, about 7 × 1.2 µm

by side, each very likely composed of dikinetids having 2–3 µm long cilia (Fig. 160c, f; Table
54). Pharyngeal basket oblique-conical, that is, longer ventrally than dorsally, opens on ventral
(brosse) side; basket rods lightly impregnated with protargol, originate from circumoral dikinetids
(Fig. 160c, d).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality with very low abundance.
Remarks: There is only one species similar to P. monosticha, viz., P. bisticha Foissner, 1999b.
These species differ mainly in having one vs. two caudal cilia and the presence vs. absence of
somatic extrusomes. Further, P. monosticha has a non-overlapping number of ciliary rows (Table
54): 22–26 (x = 23.9) vs. 17–19 (x = 18.1).

Plagiocampa rouxi Kahl, 1926 (Fig. 161a–k, 162a–n; Tables 55, 56)
Material deposited: 3 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens from
Venezuelan site (56) have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant cells have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description of a population from Venezuelan site (56): Size in vivo 35–50 × 15–30 µm, usually
about 45 × 25 µm, as calculated from some in vivo measurements and data in Table 55 adding
15% preparation shrinkage. Body shape rather variable, i. e., slightly to distinctly obovate, slightly
reniform, or ellipsoid with bluntly pointed ends (Fig. 161a–d); in protargol and SEM preparations
usually ellipsoid (Fig. 161e, f, 162k–m). Nuclear apparatus in or near cell centre (Fig. 161a, e,
f, 162a–c, k, l; Table 55). Macronucleus small compared to body size, i. e., 5–6 µm in protargol
preparations, globular to very broadly ellipsoid, contains a large central nucleolus and several small
peripheral nucleoli. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, about 1.5 µm in diameter. Contractile
vacuole and excretory pore subterminal in unciliated posterior pole area between ventral and right
side (Fig. 161a, e, 162a, b, k). No extrusomes recognizable. Cortex slightly flexible, not furrowed
by ciliary rows, right of ciliary rows a granular line (Fig. 162e, f, m, n). Cytoplasm colourless,
specimens, however, usually dark at low magnification (≤ 100×) due to compact food vacuoles up
to 12 µm across, many lipid droplets mainly in posterior half of cell, and countless, ring-shaped,
colourless granules in anterior half; granules 1–2 µm, usually about 1.7 µm across, rather refractive
but organic in nature, ring wall thicker than ring hole, impregnate deeply with silver nitrate;
developing granules without distinct wall, yellowish (Fig. 161a, 162c, d, j). Feeds on heterotrophic
flagellates of the genus Chilomonas. Swims rather rapidly rotating about main body axis.
Somatic cilia 7–8 µm long in vivo, arise from distinct pits, arranged in an average of 14 ordinarily
spaced, meridional rows each comprising about 13 ordinarily spaced cilia. Ciliary rows not
indented, separated from oral opening by a 2–3 µm wide perioral area, begin with a dikinetid
composed of comparatively widely spaced cilia, and extend 88% of body length on average; rows
posterior to adoral membranelles commence with two dikinetids; unciliated posterior pole area
with an about 20 µm long caudal cilium in pole centre (Fig. 161a, e–h, 162a, b, e, g, k–n; Table 55).
Oral opening and perioral zone occupy about half of anterior body width. Oral opening elliptic,
dorsal margin occupied by a semicircular array of 6–8 (x = 7) paroral dikinetids associated
with about 4 µm long flaps beating up and down. Three minute adoral membranelles (brosse)
in small concavities on ventral margin of mouth opening; individual membranelles each
composed of six basal bodies three bearing an about 2 µm long cilium; membranelles 1
and 2 in line with ciliary rows, membranelle 3 oriented obliquely. Pharynx obtriangular in
lateral view, dorsal wall supported by about 4 µm long nematodesmata originating from
paroral dikinetids; ventral wall supported by inconspicuous nematodesmata originating
from adoral membranelles (Foissner 1984; Fig. 161a–i, 162a–c, e–g, i, k, l; Table 55).
Silverline pattern plagiocampid, i. e., composed of two systems (Fig. 156): one consists
of large, sigmoidal meshes (Fig. 162d), the other matches the cortex pattern (Fig. 162h).
Remarks: The redescription is based on a population from Venezuelan site (56)
and has been supplemented, mainly the photographic documentation, by supposed

conspecifics from Salzburg, Saudi Arabia (Foissner et al. 2008a), and Namibia
(Foissner et al. 2002). Very likely, P. rouxi is an euryoecious, cosmopolitan species
occurring in limnetic and terrestrial habitats, preferring mesosaprobic environments.
Plagiocampa rouxi-like populations are common. Thus, there are several descriptions available,
all deviating more or less from each other (Table 56 and rouX 1899, Kahl 1926, 1930a, Foissner
1978a, 1984). Indeed, body shape and size appear highly variable while the number of ciliary
rows and circumoral dikinetids as well as the length of the oral flaps and the caudal cilium are

fairly constant. Very likely, the macronuclear structure (with or without a central nucleolus) and
the cytoplasmic granules (few or numerous, homogenous or ring-shaped) are poor features.
Based on the knowledge available, P. rouxi can be diagnosed as follows: Size in vivo about 40
× 20 µm; slightly to distinctly obovate or ellipsoid. Macronucleus globular. Contractile vacuole
and excretory pore subterminal in unciliated pole area. Cytoplasm frequently studded with
ordinary or ring-shaped rather refractive organic granules. Usually 14 ciliary rows commencing
subapically with a dikinetid and extending over about 90% of body length; those posterior to
adoral membranelles commence with one or two dikinetids; caudal cilium in pole centre, about
half as long as body. Usually, 7–8 circumoral dikinetids associated with 3–4 µm long oral flaps. 3
minute adoral membranelles (brosse) each composed of 6 basal bodies, membranelle 3 obliquely
oriented. In limnetic and terrestrial habitats. About 25 Plagiocampa species have been described
but only a quarter has been investigated with modern methods: P. bitricha Foissner, 1999b; P.
difficilis Foissner, 1981a; P. monotricha (this monograph); P. namibiensis Foissner et al., 2002;
P. ovata gelei, 1954 (redescribed by Foissner 2000a and Foissner et al. 2002); P. pentadactyla
(Foissner et al. 2002), and P. rouxi Kahl, 1926 (redescribed several times, see Table 56). Of
the seven well described species, only P. difficilis is possibly a junior synonym of P. rouxi
because their features become more and more similar the more populations are investigated.

specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz
(LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description: Size in vivo 27–36 × 11–17 µm, usually about 30 × 15 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and values shown in Table 57 adding 15% preparation shrinkage.
Body ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid, on average 2.3:1 (Fig. 163a, c; Table 57). Nuclear apparatus
in or slightly posterior to mid-body (Fig. 163a, d; Table 57). Macronucleus globular to broadly
ellipsoid, with rather large nucleoli. Likely one micronucleus usually difficult to separate from
cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end. Cortex inconspicuous, without
granules. Extrusomes not studied in vivo, not recognizable in protargol preparations. Cytoplasm
colourless, contains food vacuoles 4–7 µm across; likely feeds on small, heterotrophic flagellates.
Movement without peculiarities.
Somatic cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 13 meridional, ordinarily
spaced rows each composed of about 12 ordinarily spaced cilia with intrarow distances distinctly
increasing from anterior to posterior; each row commences with a dikinetid, central ventral rows
with an additional dikinetid each. Caudal cilium about 15 µm long in vivo, inserts in or near
centre of posterior pole (Fig. 163a–d; Table 57).
Oral opening occupies anterior body end (Fig. 163a–d; Table 57). Adoral membranelles on ventral
margin of oral opening, minute, i. e., each composed of three to four basal bodies possibly having
short cilia. Paroral membrane on dorsal margin of oral opening, composed of five to six dikinetids
each associated with an about 3 µm long flap possibly containing a toxicyst (cp. Foissner 1985).
Oral basket difficult to recognize, extends to mid-body.

Occurrence and ecology: Plagiocampa difficilis has been recorded from all main biogeographic
regions, even from Antarctica (Foissner 1996a). It prefers meagre and extreme habitats.
Remarks: This population matches rather well that described by Foissner (1981a) but sligthly
weakens the distance to P. rouxi because of the absence of a central nucleolus in the macronucleus.
A close relationship of P. rouxi and P. difficilis is also indicated by the increased number of
dikinetids in the kineties posterior to the adoral membranelles (Fig. 163b, c).
Metathrix nov. gen
Diagnosis: Metacystidae with contractile vacuole in mid-body and 4 perioral ciliary rings,
anterior two rings composed of dikinetids. Lorica, receptacle, and terminal vacuole absent.
Type species: Metathrix ellipsoidea nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of Greek prefix meta (associated with, changed, substituted for) and the
Greek noun thrix (hair = ciliate s.l.), assuming that the freely motile life style was associated with
the loss of a lorica. Feminine gender.
Remarks: As yet, the Metacystidae contained three genera (Kahl 1930a, lynn 2008): Metacystis,
Vasicola, and Pelatractus. They differ from each other by the perioral ciliary pattern: two rings
each of dikinetids and monokinetids in Vasicola (KreutZ and Foissner 2006; the redescription of
V. ciliata by dragesCo et al. 1974 is wrong) and Metathrix (Fig. 164b, 165e–g) while one ring
of dikinetids and four rings of monokinetids in Metacystis (Fig. 164c) and Pelatractus (aladro-
lubel and MartineZ-Murillo 2003, arregui et al.2010, dragesCo et al. 1974, Foissner 1984).
Vasicola and Metathrix differ by the presence vs. absence of a lorica and a receptacle, i. e., a kind
of oral cavity (Kahl 1930a). Metacystis and Pelatractus differ by the terminal vacuole that is
unciliated in the former and ciliated in the latter (Kahl 1930a, KreutZ and Foissner 2006). The
systematic position of the Metacystidae is not known. Metathrix possibly has a minute brush,
supporting the classification into the Prostomatea (lynn 2008).
Metathrix ellipsoidea nov. spec.
Diagnosis: Size about 35 × 22 µm in vivo; ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid. Single macronucleus
and micronucleus in or near centre of cell. On average 23 or 32 longitudinal ciliary rows, forming
5–6 transverse ciliary rings. Single caudal cilium in or near centre of pole.
Etymology: The Latinized adjective ellipsoidea (ellipsoid) refers to body shape.
Remarks: We split this species into two subspecies because of the distinct difference in the
number of ciliary rows. Other differences, especially in the length:width ratio of the body, are
possibly caused by the different preparation methods used.

Diagnosis: With 29–35, on average 32 longitudinal ciliary rows.

a Rough values obtained from diameter of circumoral kinety.
b Basically, there are five rings (see description).
Type locality: Venezuelan site (31), viz., a small ephemeral puddle (Laja) on granitic outcroppings
between the Agricultural Research Institute and the airport of Pto. Ayacucho, 67°36‘W 5°41‘N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens
470

are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. Further material is contained in the type slides
of Apertospathula lajacola deposited at the same locality.
Description: The following description is valid for both subspecies because they differ from
each other mainly by the number of ciliary rows. Different methods were applied for studying the
morphology. However, there are few characters that can be recognized only by a certain method,
viz., the location of the excretory pore (not recognizable in protargol-impregnated M. ellipsoidea
ellipsoidea) and the fibres associated with some circumoral dikinetids (not recognizable in silver
nitrate-impregnated M. ellipsoidea oligostriata).
Size 25–45 × 18–25 µm in vivo, usually about 35 × 22 µm, according to some in vivo measurements
and the values shown in Table 58 adding 20% length shrinkage and 10% width inflation in the
protargol preparations; length:width ratio thus distinctly lower (1.3:1) in protargol than in silver
nitrate (1.7:1) prepared cells. Most specimens broadly to ordinarily ellipsoid slightly narrowing
posteriorly; rarely rather distinctly ovate, slightly reniform, or almost globular; oral opening
slightly projecting, posterior end broadly rounded, without terminal vacuole (Fig. 164a, 165d, g,
h). Nuclear apparatus in or near body centre on average, may be displaced by food vacuoles (Fig.
164a, f, 165d; Table 58). Macronucleus about 8 µm across, with compact nucleoli 1–3 µm in size.
Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, about 2 µm across. Contractile vacuole slightly anterior
of body centre, excretory pore about 1.5 µm across and located as follows in 37 specimens
investigated: between ciliary rings 2 and 3 or 3 and 4, or within ring 3 in 12, 2, and 2 five-ringed
cells, respectively; between rings 2 and 3 or 3 and 4, or within ring 3 in 7, 12, and 2 six-ringed
cells, respectively (Fig. 164a, f, g, 165a, h; Table 58). Extrusomes, very likely mucocysts, about 1
× 0.4 µm in size and thus difficult to recognize, scattered within ciliary rows and in posterior pole
area (Fig. 164a, e). Cortex conspicuous because about 2 µm thick and rectangularly patterned
by comparatively large alveoli indistinctly separated from cytoplasm; rectangular units with a
compact granule in each corner, cilia in mid of long side of units; appears slightly transversely
furrowed by kinety rings (Fig. 164a, e, 165a, b). Environmental specimens usually dark at
low magnification because studded with (i) compact food vacuoles 4–7 µm across, (ii) few to
many lipid droplets 1–2 µm in size, and (iii) some minute crystals sparkling under interference
contrast illumination (Fig. 164a, 165c). Likely feeds on bacteria, fungal spores, and small ciliates
(Apocyclidium terricola) lysed above mouth opening and ingesting the fluid produced. Swims
rapidly rotating about main body axis. Does not build a lorica on microscope slides or in the non-
flooded Petri dish culture.
Somatic ciliature monokinetal; cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, arranged in highly ordered pattern
producing five or six transverse ciliary rings and an average of 32 bipolar rows; in five-ringed
specimens frequently an incomplete ciliary ring between last and penultimate ring, causing five
or six rings, depending on area analysed; close to inner margin of last ciliary ring three to five
cilia forming a short row. Caudal cilium in or near centre of pole, about 25 µm long in vivo, distal
third very fine (Fig. 164a, d, f, g, 165d, g, h; Table 58). Somatic basal bodies accompanied by a
parasomal sac, making kinetids oblong in silver nitrate preparations. A granule ring each between
ciliary rings; granules scattered in posterior pole region (Fig. 164g, 165g–j). Silverline pattern
possibly very similar to cortical pattern (Fig. 164g).

473

Oral opening in centre of anterior end, about 5 µm across, surrounded by a circumoral kinety
and perioral ciliature, without receptacle. Circumoral dikinetids associated with about 3 µm long
bristles resembling those of, e. g., Urotricha; three of them associated with long fibres obliquely
extending to body midline, resembling a prostomatean brush. Perioral ciliary rows extend along
distinct longitudinal ribs, forming two dikinetal and two monokinetal rings (Fig. 164a, b, f, g,
165d–g; Table 58).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at type locality and Venezuelan site (56), i. e., in
ephemeral habitats, indicating that M. ellipsoidea is a limnetic species.
Remarks: We did not find a species in the literature that could be identical with M. ellipsoidea.
However, body shape and size are similar to those of many small prostomatean and haptorian
ciliates, e. g., Urotricha and Enchelys. Thus, careful observation is required, especially of the
typical cortex structure, the caudal cilium, the perioral ciliature and, especially, the curious
location of the contractile vacuole.
Metathrix ellipsoidea oligostriata nov. subspec. (Fig. 164d, g, 165g–j; Table 58)
Diagnosis: With 20–26, on average 23 longitudinal ciliary rows.
Type locality: Floodplain soil from the Aurelio Lagoon in the Paraná River floodplain,
surroundings of the town of Maringá, State of Matu Grosso du Sul, Brazil, W53°15’ S22°40’.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate-impregnated
specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz
(LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin prefix oligo (few) and the Latin participial adjective striata
(striated).
Description: This subspecies differs from M. ellipsoidea ellipsoidea mainly (only?) by the non-
overlapping number of longitudinal ciliary rows: 20–26 (23) vs. 29–35 (32). Such difference is
considered as typical for subspecies (see General Section) and is frequently even used for species
rank because the number of ciliary rows is an important and comparatively stable feature.
Pseudotelotrochidium nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Stalked Epistylididae with permanently ciliated aboral wreath. A row of narrowly
spaced granules posterior of aboral ciliary wreath. Swarmer with open oral apparatus.
Type species: Pseudotelotrochidium epistylis nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek pseudo (false) and the Greek generic name Telotrochidium
(Telotrocha = worm-larva and eidos = form). Neuter gender.
474

Remarks: Pseudotelotrochidium epistylis could belong to two morphogenera: Epistylis (colonial)
and Rhabdostyla (non-colonial). As the latter may form small colonies, as does P. epistylis, some
authors synonymized Rhabdostyla with Epistylis (stiller 1971). However, none of the described
Epistylis and Rhabdostyla species have the two unique characteristics of P. epistylis: a permanently
invaginated posterior body portion and a permanently ciliated aboral wreath. The last feature is
shared with only one other peritrich ciliate, viz., Amphiphyra ameiuri, a fish parasite belonging
to the Scyphidiidae (see loM & dyKova 1992 for an excellent redescription).
The permanent aboral ciliary wreath of P. epistylis is identical to that found in Telotrochidium and
Opisthonecta. However, these genera never develop a stalk (for reviews, see Foissner 1975b and
Martin-CereCeda et al. 2007).
Pseudotelotrochidium epistylis nov. spec. (Fig. 166a–j, 167a–u, 168a–v, 169a–d;
Table 59)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 85 × 40 µm; barrel-shaped with posterior region invaginated.
Macronuclear strand elongate C-shaped in longitudinal body axis. Contractile vacuole and
cytopyge slightly posterior of oral bulge in dorsal wall of vestibulum. On average, 99 silverlines
from anterior body end to aboral ciliary wreath and 16 silverlines from there to scopula. Oral
apparatus of ordinary size, oral disc slightly convex to hemispherical. Adoral ciliary spiral
performs one turn each on oral disc and in vestibulum; polykineties end in usual pattern. Stalk
on average slightly shorter than body, about 4 µm across, very rarely branched. Swarmers 70–
130 × 30–40 µm in size, more or less funnel-shaped and curved laterally. Resting cyst faceted;
infraciliature maintained.
Type locality: Floodplain soil of the Rio Claro about 10 km upstream of the Pousada Rio Claro,
northern Pantanal, Brazil, 56°62’W16°25’S.
Type material: We deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI)
1 holotype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens from the type locality and 7 paratype
slides with protargol-impregnated and silver nitrate-impregnated cells. Further, 4 voucher slides
with silver nitrate and protargol-impregnated specimens from Jamaica were deposited in the
same locality. Relevant specimens were marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: A noun in apposition, i. e., named after the genus Epistylis because of the high
similarity to Epistylis spp.
Description of morphostatic specimens: The Jamaican specimens are highly similar to those
from the Brazilian type population, both in vivo and in silver preparations (Table 59). If not
mentioned otherwise, the description refers to the type population.
Body size (Table 59): In vivo, P. epistylis has a size of 60–100 × 30–50 µm, on average 84 × 42
µm. Both, body size and length:width ratio are moderately variable (CV up to 13%) in vivo and
in protargol preparations, showing that P. epistylis contracts slowly and not strongly.
Body shape (Fig. 166a, 167a–c, e, f, h, j; Table 59): When extended, P. epistylis is barrel-shaped due
to the narrowed oral region and the invaginated and thus comparatively broad posterior portion.

The invagination is highly characteristic and is 5 to 8 µm deep, containing the region between
aboral ciliary wreath and scopula; it is recognizable also in contracted specimens (Fig. 167j) but
disappears in the swarmers (Fig. 167l, s). When contracted, P. epistylis is broadly ellipsoidal to
globular (Fig. 167a) with the oral bulge slightly snout-like projecting in the Jamaican specimens
(Fig. 167h).
Nuclear apparatus (Fig. 166a, c, 168a, b; Table 59): Both, in vivo and in protargol preparations the
macronucleus is in the longitudinal body axis and dorsal to the oral apparatus, usually commencing
in the oral disc and extending to the aboral ciliary wreath; it never extends posterior of the wreath
while its anterior end may be 0–9 µm distant from body end, producing a variability of 72%.

(strongly opaque) in the bright field microscope. n, t: Mature cyst, showing the about 7 µm thick wall (opposed arrowheads)
consisting of three layers (from inside to outside): the about 2 µm thick internal layer (1), the about 6 µm thick, ridged middle
layer (2), and the external membrane (3). o–q: Surface views of mature cysts, showing the ridges of the middle layer. The size
of the polygons formed by the ridges is highly variable. r–v: Genesis of the resting cyst. Arrowheads mark the distal end of the

secreted (s). continued vis à vis
482

Fig. 169a–d. Epistylis alpestris after protargol impregnation. In vivo, E. alpestris resembles Pseudotelotrochidium epistylis,
both in the morphostatic and in the swarming state. However, they differ by several important features (see Remarks), of which
two are recognizable in these micrographs: with vs. without epistomial membrane (b, d) and with long, sigmoidal (b, c) vs.
short, slightly curved (Fig. 168b, g) polykinety 3. AS, adoral ciliary spiral, AW – aboral ciliary wreath, E – basal bodies of the
epistomial membrane, F – fibrous plate, G – germinal kinety, H – haplokinety, MA – macronucleus, MY – myonemes, P(1–3) –
aboral polykineties, S – scopula, V – vestibulum. Scale bars 10 µm (d), 20 µm (b, c), and 50 µm (a).
The macronucleus is narrowed in the middle third and is elongate C-shaped with both ends more
or less inflated and twisted; it is studded with large and small nucleoli. The micronucleus is at
or near the anterior end of the macronucleus, rarely at other sites. In protargol preparations, the
micronucleus shows a distinct membrane and is about 4 µm in size; frequently, it is lightly or not
impregnated.
Contractile vacuole and cytopyge (Fig. 166a, 167c, d): Both are close to the posterior margin
of the oral bulge at the dorsal wall of the vestibulum. The cytopyge is anterior of the contractile
vacuole and releases granular food remnants.
Cortex and silverline pattern (Fig. 166a, f, 167b, c, j, p, t, u, 168k, l; Table 59): The cortex is rigid
and colourless. It is transversely striated by ridges so minute that it appears smooth in the light
microscope, though each ridge produces a minute convexity, as typical for epistylids (Foissner
& sChiFFMann 1974, Foissner 1975a) and recognizable in the scanning micrographs (Fig. 167j,
p, 168k). The silverline pattern of P. epistylis is as typical for most sessile peritrichs, i.e., it is
Fig. 168m–v. Next, the wall condenses and begins to form ridges (u, asterisks). In the mature cyst, the ridges become very
prominent (n–p, v). AS – adoral ciliary spiral, AW – aboral ciliary wreath, C – cortex of cell, F – fibre bundle, MA – macronucleus,
R – ridges, RP – ring of pores, S – scopula, W – cyst wall. Scale bars 10 µm (s, t), 15 µm (n–q), and 20 µm (m, r, u, v).
483

composed of transverse rings with an average distance of 0.73 µm (average body length in vivo
by average number of silverline rings). The number of silverline rings is conspicuously stable
(CV 3–8%): on average 99 rings from the anterior body end to the aboral ciliary wreath and 16
rings from the wreath to the scopula (Fig. 167t, u, 168k, l; Table 59). In 100 µm2 is an average of
32 distinct cortical pores most attached to the anterior margin of the silverlines.
Myoneme system (Fig. 168c–e): Pseudotelotrochidium epistylis contracts rather slowly and not
very strongly, i.e., fully contracted, broadly ellipsoidal cells are shorter than extended cells by
only one third (Fig. 167a, h). Indeed, the myoneme system (Fig. 168c–e) is simple when compared
with that of other epistylids (Foissner 1977a, b; Foissner et al. 1985, 2009a): myonemes are
lacking or inconspicuous in the oral bulge and the oral disc, and a disc retractor is absent. There
extend about 13 myoneme strands from the scopula to the aboral ciliary wreath and about 20–25
strands in mid-body, most of which are attached to the external portion of the adoral ciliary spiral
(Fig. 168d, e).
Cytoplasm (Fig. 166a, 167a–d, f–h, k): The cytoplasm is granular and colourless. There is no
accumulation of refractive granules in the body. Depending on food, the cytoplasm contains few to
many food vacuoles 3–6 µm across and accumulated in middle third of body. Pseudotelotrochidium
epistylis feeds exclusively on ellipsoidal, about 3 µm long bacteria well recognizable in young
food vacuoles (Fig. 167c, d, k).
Oral apparatus (Fig. 166a–c, 167a–d, f, g, 168a, b, f–h; Table 59): The oral apparatus is quite
similar to that of many other epistylids. The oral bulge is 6–8 µm thick in vivo and narrower
than mid-body by 20% on average (Fig. 166a, 167b–d, f; Table 59). The oral disc is highly
variable, i.e., it is slightly convex to hemispheral and up to 10 µm high (Fig. 166a, 167b–d, f). The
vestibulum is of ordinary size and extends obliquely (~ 45°) to near mid-body. The adoral ciliary
spiral performs one turn each on the oral disc and in the vestibulum (Fig. 166a, 167c, d, 168a,
b, f–h). The polykineties end isostichad (see Discussion). The lack of an epistomial membrane
has been carefully checked in vivo and in protargol preparations in morphostatic cells and in
swarmers.
Aboral ciliary wreath and scopula (Fig. 166a, c, f, g, 167b, f, g, i, j, q, r, t, u, 168c, e; Table 59):
The posterior body region and the aboral ciliary wreath are invaginated as described above (Fig.
167j). The wreath is about 1 µm width in the protargol preparations while kineties are 1.5–2 µm
long because they are obliquely oriented (Fig. 168b, c). The wreath is permanently ciliated with
about 10 µm long, very densely spaced cilia beating slowly and only slightly, thus appearing
like a membrane (Fig. 167i, j). Posterior of the wreath is a single row of distinct cortical pores
between about 1 µm high ridges (Fig. 166g, 167q, r, 168c).
The scopula has 3–3.5 µm in diameter. The scopular organelles, which are about 1–1.2 µm long,
are more densely arranged in the margin than the centre of the scopula (Fig. 166a, f, g, 167j, t
168b–e).
Stalk (Fig. 166a, i, 167b, e–g, i; Table 59): The stalk is inconspicuous because it has an average
size of only 63 × 4 µm. It never branched in the Brazilian specimens while a few bifurcate mini-
colonies were observed in the Jamaican population (Fig. 166i). The stalk, which is hyaline and
structureless in the light- and scanning electron microscope, is attached to a variety of solid
matters, such as soil particles and slimy bacterial masses (Fig. 167b, g, i).
Ontogenesis (Fig. 168h–l): We found some main divisional stages in the preparations. These show
that: (i) the aboral ciliary wreath is reorganized (k, l), (ii) the macronucleus becomes transversely
484

oriented (i), and (iii) the infraciliature develops as described by wang et al. (2012) in Epistylis.
Conjugation (Fig. 167b): The microgamont attaches to the macrogamont at various sites between
near anterior body end and aboral ciliary wreath.
Swarmer: Pseudotelotrochidium epistylis can transform to a swarmer when the environmental
conditions become unfavourable (Fig. 166f, h, 167k–o, q–s). The transformation needs about 10
min and is associated with the excavation of the posterior body part, the excretion of most food
vacuoles, and the separation from the stalk. Young swarmers still have some food vacuoles (Fig.
167a) while the older ones show a “clear” cytoplasm studded with granules up to 1 µm across
(Fig. 167s).
Mature swarmers swim very rapidly with the aboral ciliary wreath ahead and are slightly to
distinctly funnel-shaped, rarely cylindroidal (Fig. 166h, 167l, m, s). They have a size of 70–130
× 30–40 µm in vivo and are slightly to distinctly curved, producing many minute bulges along
the body (Fig. 167m). The aboral ciliary wreath is as in the morphostatic specimens but the cilia
elongated from about 10 µm to 15 µm and are much more active (Fig. 166f, 167q–s). The oral
structures are neither contracted or changed, making it difficult to separate adults and swarmers
in silver preparations; an epistomial membrane is absent (Fig. 166h, 167k, m).
When contracting, the swarmer first becomes distinctly curved and bulged, especially in the
middle third (Fig. 167n). Fully contracted swarmers are broadly pyriform to globular with the
oral bulge forming a minute snout (Fig. 167h, o).
Encystment and resting cyst: Pseudotelotrochidium epistylis encysted in the raw culture. First,
the cell closes the oral apparatus and becomes globular. Concomitantly, a thick fibre bundle,
which is surrounded by many large and small nucleoli, develops in the centre of the macronuclear
strand that becomes semicircular to circular and orients transversely to the main body axis (Fig.
166d, 168r). Next, the cell secrets an about 4 µm thick wall that is hyaline and structureless
(Fig. 166e, 168s). Then, the wall slightly condenses and commences to form ridges (Fig. 168u).
When the ridges are well recognizable, they are made of a thin (≤ 1 µm), membrane-like material
(Fig. 166j, 168m). In this stage, the cyst contents are very dense and thus dark under bright field
illumination and low to moderate magnifications (≤ 250×). In mature cysts, the wall of the ridges
becomes thicker and higher, making the ridges very conspicuous (Fig. 168n–q, t). We did not
observe the secretion of the internal cyst wall.
Mature cysts are spherical to slightly ellipsoidal and have an average size of 48 µm (with ridges)
or 36 µm (without ridges) in vivo; thus, the ridges are about 6 µm high (Table 59). The cyst
wall has three layers (Fig. 168t): a rather thick external membrane covers the yellowish ridge
layer, which is composed of strongly refractive, 1–2 µm thick sheets; the internal layer, which is
colourless and moderately refractive, is about 1.5 µm thick. Thus, total wall thickness is about 7
µm (Fig. 168n, t; Table 59). The ridge polygons are of rather different size in the individual cysts
(Fig. 168o–q). The cyst contents and the macronucleus are distinctly condensed (Fig. 168m, n,
v). The cytoplasm is moderately refractive and composed of lipid (?) globules 1–2 µm across.
The contractile vacuole appears as a small blister which does not contract. The oral and aboral
infraciliature is maintained, possibly including the cilia (Fig. 166j, 168r, s, u, v).
In addition to the morphometric data shown in Table 59, we calculated the following ratios:
485

cyst volume (with wall) in % of morphostatic cells = 49%, which is quite similar to the 51% in
Vorticella echini but rather different from the 24% in Opisthonecta henneguyi (Foissner et al.
2006); cyst volume (without wall) by morphostatic cell volume = 0.26; and cyst wall thickness
by cyst radius = 0.41.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet, P. epistylis has been found in an ephemeral habitat each in
Central and South America: in the mud of a tree-hole in the campus of the University of the West
Indies, Kingston, Jamaica, and in floodplain soil from the Pantanal in Brazil. Further, it occurs
at Venezuelan sites (1, 13, 25), i. e., in flood plain soil of the Orinoco River and in soil from two
Mahadjas.
Possibly, P. epistylis is restricted to Central and South America because we did not find it in
Austria during our studies on stalkless peritrichs (Foissner 1975b, 1976, 1977) and in about 1000
samples of soil globally (Foissner 1998; Foissner et al. 2002), including rather many samples
from floodplains, e.g., the Murray River in Australia (Foissner, unpubl.), the Niger River in West
Africa (Foissner & stoeCK 2006), and the Enns River in Austria (Foissner 2004).
We did not perform ecological experiments. However, both populations developed in non-flooded
Petri dish cultures and could be cultivated in tap water enriched with some squashed wheat grains
and some ml of the eluate from the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Remarks: There are few Epistylis and Rhabdostyla species that have a long macronucleus
oriented in main body axis (for reviews, see Kahl 1935, stiller 1971). Those which have such a
macronucleus form colonies or have the contractile vacuole on the ventral wall of the vestibulum,
e.g., E. lacustris, E. pürneri, and E. sessilis. Thus, P. epistylis is fairly easily distinguished from
other epistylidids even in vivo.
However, there are two species which in vivo superficially resemble P. epistylis: Epistylis alpestris
and Telotrochidium cylindricum, both described by Foissner (1978b). Epistylis alpestris, as
described by Foissner (1978b) and Foissner et al. (2002) is larger than P. epistylis (100–140 µm
vs. 60–100 µm in vivo), usually forms distinct colonies (vs. usually singly), is obconical (vs.
barrel-shaped) when extended; has the oral opening of the swarmer closed (vs. open), possesses
138–160 (vs. 92–106) silverlines from the anterior body end to the aboral ciliary wreath and 35–
45 (vs. 14–18) silverlines from the aboral wreath to the scopula, the adoral ciliary spiral performs
1.5 (vs. 1) turn within the vestibulum, has an epistomial membrane (Fig. 169a, d) (vs. lacking),
and polykinety 3 is distinctly (vs. not) elongated posteriorly (Fig. 169b, c). These are quite a lot
of differences but most are difficult to recognize in vivo.
Telotrochidium cylindricum differs from the swarmer of P. epistylis by body size (130–170 vs.
70–130 µm in vivo), body shape (usually cylindroidal vs. conical), the number of silverlines
from the anterior body end to the aboral ciliary wreath (142–156 vs. 92–106) and from the
aboral wreath to the scopula (20–28 vs. 14–18), and a row of cortical granules each anterior and
posterior (vs. only posterior) of the aboral wreath. Obviously, swarmers of P. epistylis are difficult
to distinguish from T. cylindricum in vivo.

Cothurnia minutissima (Penard, 1914) Kahl, 1935 (Fig. 170a–c)
Attached to soil particles from Venezuelan site (54), we found two specimens of a loricate peritrich
ciliate that might have been C. minutissima (Fig. 170a–c). The lorica was 40–43 µm long and
slightly curved, in one specimen indistinct ridges were recognizable in posterior half (Fig. 170a).
The identification followed Penard (1914) and was based on the size and shape of the lorica
because the inhabitant did not extend (Fig. 170a, b).

Hypotrichida
“About one third of 128 new species discovered in the 73 soil samples are hypotrichs. This matches
the high dominance of soil hypotrichs in general (FOISSNER 1998) and might be associated with
the flexible, elongated body pre-adapting hypotrichs for life in microporous (soil) environments.
Both saline and desert habitats are rich in new species, showing the evolutionary pressure of
extreme habitats.
Many of the new species look inconspicuous, that is, are small and of ordinary shape. However,
more detailed investigations show that they are not only undescribed, but also representatives
of new genera. Indeed, some of the new “ontogenetic” genera established in this book are so
surprising and unexplainable that hypotrich classification appears hopelessly complicated. And
there is no indication that further new taxa to be discovered will clear the matter!
We still have about 200 undescribed soil hypotrichs in our notebooks, showing that the present
study just touched the peak of an iceberg. It is even possible that there are more terrestrial than
487

(described) limnetic hypotrichs. This bewildering diversity shows that there must be thousands
of hypotrich species, most still undescribed (Foissner et al. 2002).”
Twelve years after the notion by Foissner et al. (2002) little has been changed. A flood of papers
by Chinese, Korean, Indian, and Austrian researchers shows the proposed high diversity of the
hypotrichs. In fact, nearly half of the species described or redescribed in the present monograph
belong to this group. The molecular taxonomy made little progress, although now much more
sequences are available than in 2002, but shows that the small subunit (SSU) rDNA is insufficient
for entangling the complex phylogeny of the hypotrichs (Foissner et al. 2014 a, heber et al. 2014,
lynn 2008, Paiva et al. 2009, sChMidt et al. 2007a, shao et al. 2015, singh & KaMra 2013, 2015,
song et al. 2009, yi & Song 2011, yi et al. 2009a, b, 2012). More genes, detailed ontogenetic
studies, and fine-tuned morphological investigations can probably provide new insights into the
classification and geographic distribution of the hypotrichs.
Australothrix steineri Foissner, 1995 (Fig. 171a–l, 172a–e; Table 60)
Material: (i) Costa Rican paratype specimens from the original description. (ii) Costa Rican site
(20), Santa Rosa National Park, 85°08’W 10°27’N, very near to the type locality of A. steineri.
Tropical dry rain forest, bark (pH 7.1) from an old Acacia tree at the entrance to the Hacienda “La
Pacifica” near to the town of Canas. Live observation with special regard to the cortical granules.
(iii) Venezuelan site (54). Live observation and protargol impregnation. One voucher slide
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). (iv) Brazilian site
(28): Surface litter and glayic soil from an island in the Amazon River in the outskirts of the town
of Manaus; flooded during high water; 60°W 4°S. Protargol impregnation. Two voucher slides
deposited. (v) Brazilian site (32): About 40 km west of Manaus, Anavilhanas archipelago in the
Rio Negro, vicinity of Ariau lodge, 60°W 4°S. Blackwater inundation primary (?) rain forest on
one of the many small islands of the region, flooded by the Rio Negro during high water periods.
Collection of litter, soil and roots from 0–8 cm; litter layer up to 5 cm thick, followed by a 3–5 cm
thick root-carpet mixed with brown, humic soil; mineral soil under root-carpet loamy, brown; pH
5.1. Three voucher slides deposited. (vi) Republic of South Africa, Cape of Good Hope Nature
Reserve, 18°25’E 34°15’S. Fynbos biome, soil from margin of a small pond (Sirkelsvlei) flooded
by high water. Soil sandy with many grass roots, pH 5.4 in water. Live observation and protargol
impregnation. Three voucher slides deposited.
Additional observations and remarks: Over the years, we found six populations, five in Central
and South America and one in South Africa. Although they do not agree in all features, we are
rather sure that they are conspecific.
(i) Foissner (1995) stated the A. steineri lacks cortical granules, which would be a major
difference to the populations described here. Thus, we reinvestigated some deeply impregnated
paratype specimens. They show clear spots within the dorsal kineties (Fig. 172e). Their size
and location suggest that these are cortical granules.
(ii) This is corroborated by a population found in the vicinity of the type locality. These
specimens have cortical granules about 2 × 1 µm in size (Fig. 171d). See also the South
African population.

(iii) The specimens from Venezuelan site (54) differ in two features. First, they possess a curious
organelle (?) anterior of the buccal cavity. It was present in the five cells studied and has
a diameter of about 3 µm and contains minute rods (Fig. 171b). It does not impregnate
with the protargol method used. Possibly, we overlooked this minute structure in the other
populations. Second, the cortical granules are elliptic to indistinctly ovate and have a size of
about 2 × 1 µm (Fig. 171c).
(iv) The morphologic and morphometric data on the two Brazilian populations match fairly well
those from the type population (Fig. 171j–l, 172a–d; Table 60). On average the cells are
smaller (160 µm, 198 µm vs. 236 µm) and possess less right and left marginal cirri (37 vs.
63 and ~ 35 vs. 58).
(v) The South African specimens are comparatively clumsy, most lacking a distinct tail. Thus,
individual cells may be difficult to distinguish in vivo from several Uroleptus and Holosticha
s. l. species. They are more or less helically contorted, just as the specimens from the neotropic
populations (Fig. 171g–i; Table 60). The cortical granulation matches the Costa Rican site
(20) cells in size (1–1.5 × 0.5–0.7 µm) and shape (oblong) while the yellowish shimmer is
unique (Fig. 171e, f). When methyl green-pyronin is applied, the granules become inflated
to about 3 µm.
Occurrence and ecology: Australothrix steineri is very likely restricted to Gondwana, which is
supported by the two Australian species described by blatterer & Foissner (1988); at least, we
never met an Australothrix in central and north Europe. The genus has a wider distribution, as
shown by the Chinese → A. fraterculus.
Except of Costa Rican site (20), all populations of A. steineri were found in floodplain environments,
suggesting it as a semiterrestrial species rarely occurring also under mainly limnetic conditions.
Emendation of the diagnosis of A. steineri: Size in vivo about 180–270 × 25 µm. Very
elongate cuneate and usually contorted about main body axis. About 50–150 scattered, ellipsoid
macronuclear nodules and some micronuclei. Cortical granules mainly around cirri and dorsal
bristles, colourless, oblong, about 1–2 × 0.5–1 µm in size. Midventral complex composed of
2–3 midventral pairs and a long midventral row composed of about 30 cirri and extending to last
quarter of cell. A total of 6 cirral rows, ventral rows left of midventral row more or less shortened
posteriorly. 4 dorsal kineties with 4–8 caudal cirri. Prefers floodplain environments.
Australothrix fraterculus nov. spec. (Fig. 173a–k, 174a–g; Table 60)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 220 × 20 µm. Very elongate cuneate and often contorted about
main body axis. On average 65 scattered, ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 3 micronuclei.
Cortical granules mainly around cirri and dorsal bristles, colourless, ovate and 1–1.5 × 0.5–0.8
µm in size. Midventral complex composed of 3 midventral pairs and a long midventral row
composed of about 35 cirri and extending to body end. A total of 5 cirral rows, ventral row left of
midventral row ends slightly posterior to mid-body. 3 dorsal kineties and 4–6 caudal cirri. Adoral
zone extends about 15% of body length, composed of an average of 23 membranelles.

Type locality: Litter and soil from the outskirts of the town of Yungning, about 90 km northeast
of Bejing, entrance to the Big Wall at Badaling, surroundings of the toilet, 116°10’E 40°20’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin species name is a noun in apposition and a composite of frater (brother)
and the diminutive culus (small, similar), referring to the similarity with A. steineri.
Description: The variability of Australothrix spp. is rather high, i. e., most coefficients of variation
are between 15% and 20%. This is usual for large species, especially when they are slender.
Size in vivo 170–280 × 15–35 µm, usually about 220 × 20 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 60 adding 15% preparation shrinkage; very
flexible but not contractile. Body very slender, on average 10.5:1, becoming tail-like posteriorly;
usually slightly to distinctly contorted about main body axis especially when just isolated from
the non-flooded Petri dish culture, later the contortion becomes indistinct or vanishes; laterally
flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 173a, b, e, i–k, 174a, b; Table 60). Nuclear apparatus on average in
central four sixths of cell, i. e., absent from oral and tail region as well as from pharyngeal and
cortex areas. On average 65 broadly to ordinarily ellipsoid macronuclear nodules in vivo 4–7 ×
3–5 µm in size; studded with minute nucleoli. Usually two to three micronuclei scattered among
and as long as macronuclear nodules but narrower, compact and thus well recognizable in vivo
(Fig. 173a, d, h, 174a, g; Table 60). Contractile vacuole in or slightly anterior to mid-body at left
margin of cell, with long collecting canals (Fig. 173a, i). Cortex very flexible, associated with
colourless granules 1–1.5 × 0.5–0.8 µm in size, mainly around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles
(Fig. 173g, h, 174c); granules stain red with methyl green-pyronin but are not extruded and do not
impregnate with the protargol method used. Cytoplasm colourless, studded with macronuclear
nodules, some food vacuoles up to 10 µm across, and minute lipid droplets. Feeds on bacteria and
small heterotrophic flagellates. Usually glides slowly on and between soil particles, rarely swims
showing the contorted body.
Cirral pattern as typical for genus (Berger 2006), i. e., transverse cirri and frontoterminal
cirri absent and five long cirral rows, including two marginal rows, two ventral rows, and a
midventral row; most cirri in rather distinct pits, 10–12 µm long and fine, i. e., composed of
four or six basal bodies in two minute rows (Fig. 173a, b, e, f, h, 174a–f; Table 60). Three
thickened frontal cirri extend in slightly concave row from body`s midline to distal end of adoral
zone; cirrus III/2 upon midventral complex, composed of six to eight basal bodies. Buccal cirrus
at summit of paroral membrane, composed of six basal bodies. Usually three midventral pairs
right of undulating membranes, cirri composed of six basal bodies; followed by midventral row
extending subterminally with cirri composed of six basal bodies except of those on tail consisting
of only four. Right marginal row commences subapically on dorsal side, then turns to right body
margin and extends to near posterior body end, composed of cirri with six basal bodies except
of those on tail consisting of only four. Left marginal row commences slightly anterior of oral
vertex and extends to near body end with cirri composed as those of right row. One ventral cirral
496

row each right and left of midventral row, most cirri composed of only four basal bodies; right
row commences slightly posterior to frontal cirrus 3 and ends subterminally, left row commences
posterior to oral vertex and ends slightly posterior to mid-body (Fig. 173a, b, e, f, h, 174a–f; Table
60).
Dorsal kinetids in distinct pits, surrounded by cortical granules, bristles 3–4 µm long in vivo,
arranged in three rows commencing slightly subapically and ending subterminally. Four to six
caudal cirri at end of tail each composed of four, rarely two basal bodies (Fig. 173a, c, e, 174a,
b, e, g).
Adoral zone very short extending only 15% of body length, composed of an average of 23 ordinary
membranelles (Fig. 173a, b, e, f, 174a, b, d, f; Table 60). Buccal cavity flat and narrow, buccal
lip covers some proximal membranelles. Undulating membranes slightly curved, paroral about
half as long as endoral, optically intersect at level of buccal cirrus. Pharynx conspicuous possibly
because containing long endoral cilia, extends to second third of cell.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality where it was rare in the non-flooded
Petri dish culture. The locality was covered with grass and bushes. Leaf litter, soil, and roots were
collected from the upper 3 cm.
Remarks: The Chinese Australothrix is rather similar to A. steineri Foissner, 1995. They differ,
however, by three good features: cortical granules ovate vs. oblong; five vs. six cirral rows; and
three vs. four dorsal kineties.
Australothrix venezuelensis Foissner & heber nov. spec. (Fig. 175a–h, 176a–c;
Tables 61, 62)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 230 × 65 µm; very elongate obovate, pisciform, or ellipsoid.
Nuclear apparatus on average composed of 94 scattered, ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 3
micronuclei. Cortical granules in dense rows, ellipsoid, colourless, in vivo 3–4 × 1–1.5 µm in size.
Midventral complex on average composed of 7 cirral pairs and a long midventral row consisting
of about 25 cirri. 1 left and 2 right marginal cirral rows, right row 1 shortened posteriorly and thus
exceeded by midventral row. Usually 4 dorsal kineties and an average of 13 caudal cirri.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (32), i. e., soil under a carpet of Velloziacean plants in a Laja
between the Agricultural Research Station and the airport of Puerto Ayacucho, 67°36‘W 5°41‘N.
Type material: 1 holotype slide and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Australothrix venezuelensis is a comparatively large ciliate. Thus, several
measurements may be affected by preparation artifacts, as indicated by high coefficients of

usually curved to body´s midline, on average composed of 51 (37–62) cirri. Left marginal row
502

extends to body end, posteriormost cirri often dorsolaterally located, composed of 53 (39–63)
cirri on average (Fig. 175a, b, h, 176a, b; Table 61). Two supernumerary cirri between RM1 and
midventral row in one out of 24 specimens.
Dorsal bristles about 4 µm long in vivo, usually arranged in four rows with a total of 103 (82–133)
bristles; rows 1, 2, and 4 bipolar, row 3 slightly shortened anteriorly (Fig 175c, 176c; Table 61).
An additional kinety between rows 2 and 3 in two out of 21 specimens investigated, anteriorly
shortened, associated with two caudal cirri and 22, respectively, 18 dorsal bristles (Fig. 176c).
Three supernumeral caudal cirri left of dorsal row 1 in one out of 21 specimens. On average a
total of 13 caudal cirri about 12 µm long in protargol preparations: five at end of bristle row 1
and two or three each in rows 2–4, cirri of rightmost row often displaced ventrolaterally and thus
easily mixed with marginal cirri (Fig. 175c, 176a–c; Table 61).
Adoral zone occupies about 30 % of body length, proximal portion slightly spatulate, usually
composed of 41 (35–47) ordinary membranelles with cilia up to 15 µm long in protargol
preparations; bases of largest membranelles about 12 µm wide in vivo, on average 10 (8–12) µm
in protargol preparations (Fig. 175a, b, 176a, b; Table 61). Buccal cavity conspicuous because
wide and deep; buccal lip covers proximal portion of adoral zone. Undulating membranes
moderately curved, of similar length, optically intersect near level of buccal cirrus, paroral cilia
approximately 10 µm long in vivo, endoral cilia about 20 µm. Pharynx conspicuous, extends
from buccal cirrus to mid-body, broadest near proximal end of adoral zone; pharyngeal wall
studded with minute, oblong, argyrophilic structures as, for instance, in Australothrix alwinae
and Caudiholosticha notabilis (Fig. 175a, b; for a review, see Berger 2006).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. The large size and the broad body
suggest A. venezuelensis as litter or freshwater species.
Remarks: Australothrix zignis and A. gibba are poorly described aquatic species with two
macronuclear nodules (for a review, see berger 2006). The terrestrial Australothrix species are so
different from each other that polyphyly of the genus cannot be excluded (blatterer & Foissner
1988). One group, including A. australis and A. steineri, has the midventral complex near the
right body margin and several cirral rows left of the complex. The other group, composed of A.
alwinae, A. simplex, and A. venezuelensis has the midventral complex roughly in body midline
and several cirral rows right of the complex.
Australothrix venezuelensis is very likely most closely related to A. simplex shen et al., 1992
because it shares the simplified cirral pattern clearly different from that of A. alwinae (invariably
4 cirral rows vs. 7–11). Unfortunately, A. simplex has been rather superficially described. A
comparison of the morphometric data (Table 62) reveals that A. venezuelensis is best distinguished
from A. simplex by the more slender body (length:width ratio in vivo 3.7–4.4 vs. 3), the higher
number of macronuclear nodules (72–118 vs. 40–50), and the longer midventral row (19–31 cirri
posteriorly exceeding RM1 vs. ~ 5 cirri not exceeding RM1). Further, shen et al. (1992) did not
mention cortical granules (overlooked ?), a most distinct feature of A. venezuelensis.

Birojimia BerGer & Foissner, 1989
Improved diagnosis: Slender (> 2:1) Holostichidae with 1–2 left and 2 or more right marginal cirral
rows gradually shortened and replaced by dorsal bristles from anterior to posterior. Midventral
complex composed of midventral cirral pairs only. With 3 frontal cirri, frontoterminal, buccal,
transverse, and caudal cirri. Adoral zone of membranelles continuous. Several dorsal kineties,
forming distinct suture left of body midline.
Type species (by original designation): Birojimia terricola berger & Foissner, 1989.
Remarks: berger & Foissner (1989) overlooked the second main feature of this genus, viz.,
the curious arrangement of the dorsal kineties: two bipolar rows along left body margin and
several shortened rows that abut on the bipolar rows in acute angles, forming a distinct suture.
This has been confirmed by a reinvestigation of specimens from the type population. To our best
knowledge, no other hypotrich has suture-forming dorsal kineties. Thus, this feature has been
added to the diagnosis of the genus.
Birojimia matches berger’s characterization of the Holostichidae: “Urostyloidae with 3 frontal
cirri and a midventral complex composed of cirral pairs only”. berger (2006) recognizes eight
holostichid genera non having more than one right marginal row and suture-forming dorsal
kineties.
Birojimia litoralis nov. spec. (Fig. 177a–k, 178a–z, 179a–e; Table 63)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 235 × 55 µm; parallel-sided with body ends broadly rounded and
oral portion slightly narrowed. On average 150 macronuclear nodules and several micronuclei.
Cortical granules mainly within cirral and dorsal bristle rows, colourless, about 3 × 1 µm in size.
Usually 4 right and 2 left marginal rows. On average 15 midventral pairs; 2 frontoterminal, 1
buccal, and 11 transverse and pretransverse cirri; 3 caudal cirri; and 48 adoral membranelles.
Usually 9 dorsal kineties, the two leftmost bipolar, the others gradually shortened anteriorly
producing the dorsal suture.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (47), i. e., coastal sand and soil from the Henri Pittier National
Park, surroundings of the village of Choroni, 67°37’W 10°30’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin species name litoralis (pertaining to the sea-shore) refers to the habitat the
species was discovered.
Description: Size in vivo 200–290 × 45–75 µm, usually about 235 × 55 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 63 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage; slightly contractile under mild coverslip pressure. Body shape inconspicuous, elongate
504

to very elongate quadrangular (average 4.3:1) even when studded with food vacuoles, oral portion
slightly narrowed and inconspicuously cephalized due to last row of dorsal bristles, body ends
broadly rounded; laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 177a, b, j, k, 178g, h, l, u; Table 63). Nuclear
apparatus scattered throughout cytoplasm except for body ends (Fig. 177a, c, 178a, c, d, g, h, j, k;
Table 63). On average 151 globular to ellipsoid macronuclear nodules in vivo 4–7 × 3–4 µm in
size; each with several nucleoli of ordinary size. Most micronuclei in posterior half of cell, compact
and thus rather refractive, in vivo about 4 × 3 µm, number in Table 63 possibly underestimated.
Contractile vacuole at left body margin in or slightly anterior to mid-body, with long collecting
canals (Fig. 177a). Cortex very flexible, colourless. Cortical granules mainly within cirral and
dorsal bristle rows but also in barren areas forming long, rough rows composed of short, slightly
oblique granule assemblages (Fig. 177h, i, 178b, e, f, t–z, 179b). Individual granules colourless
and thus difficult to recognize, in vivo about 3 × 1 µm in size, stain red and are extruded when
methyl green-pyronin is applied, becoming long filaments forming a voluminous coat (Fig. 178e,
f, t, z); do not impregnate with the protargol method used; leave distinct holes in cortex when just
extruded (Fig. 178y); when disturbed become broadly ellipsoid (Fig. 178b). Cytoplasm colourless,
contains many lipid droplets 2–10 µm in size and large lithosome aggregates mainly in anterior

body half. Lithosome aggregates composed of a central large lithosome (~ 3 µm) surrounded by
many small, 1–2 µm-sized lithosomes (Fig. 178c, d). Usually studded with up to 60 µm-sized
food vacuoles containing small testate amoebae (Euglypha rotunda, Trinema lineare), flagellates,
ciliates and their cytoplasmic crystals, and remnants of fungal hyphe (Fig. 177a, 178a, c, 179a, b).
Cirral pattern typical of genus and thus complex, for details see Figures and morphometry (Fig.
177a, b, e, g, 178g, h, j, l–n, 179c, d; Table 63). Three enlarged, in vivo about 30 µm long frontal
cirri in oblique row, and a single, enlarged cirrus III/2 posterior of right frontal cirrus. Buccal cirrus
enlarged, very close to and at summit of paroral membrane. Two inconspicuous frontoterminal
cirri slightly right and posterior to right frontal cirrus. Midventral complex composed of 9–19, on
average 14 midventral pairs, commences close posterior to cirrus III/2, extends slightly obliquely
terminating left of body midline at 56% of body length on average; cirri slightly enlarged
especially the right ones. On average two thin pretransverse and nine transverse cirri up to 30 µm
long in vivo and thus slightly to distinctly projecting from body proper, forming a distinct corona
together with marginal and caudal cirri around posterior body margin; thickness increases from
anterior to posterior, distal end of posterior cirri fringed. Left marginal cirral row 1 commences
near level of buccal vertex, row 2 begins about 18% anterior of buccal vertex, both rows extend to

near posterior body end. Usually two, very rarely three or four left marginal cirral rows and four
right marginal rows with thin cirri composed of two rows each with five cilia about 15 µm long
in vivo; right marginal row 1 complete, i. e., without dorsal bristles anteriorly; cirri of rows 2–4
gradually replaced by dorsal bristles anteriorly (Fig. 177a, b, e, f, 178g, h, j, l–n, 179c, d; Table 63).
Dorsal bristles 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 9 rows: rows 1 and 2
bipolar extending along left body margin; rows 3–9 partially associated with right
marginal rows 2–4, as described in the diagnoses of the genus, and, possibly, with
caudal cirri; most shortened anteriorly, forming a prominent suture with bipolar kinety
2. Invariably three inconspicuous caudal cirri (Fig. 177d, 178u, v, x, y; Table 63).

Adoral zone of ordinary shape and structure, extends 32% of body length on average, composed of
an average of 48 ordinary membranelles, bases of largest membranelles about 10 µm wide in vivo;
cilia of frontal membranelles about 25 µm long in vivo; lateral membranellar cilia inconspicuous,
recognizable only in posterior portion of zone (Fig. 177a, b, e, 178a, g, h, j, l, m, o, u, v, 179d;
Table 63). Buccal cavity in vivo rather distinctly curved anteriorly, very deep extending to dorsal
side of cell, associated with a large pharynx lined by short rows of minute, granular structures,
as in B. terricola (Fig. 177a, g, 178g, h, j). Buccal lip of angular type (Foissner & al-rasheid
2006), rather broad but vertex covers only a few posterior membranelles, left margin sigmoidal
and with distinct cleft containing paroral membrane composed of ciliated dikinetids with length
of cilia gradually decreasing from about 12 µm anteriorly to 5 µm posteriorly (Fig. 177a, b, g,
178g, h, l, m, o–r). Endoral membrane covered by buccal seal (Foissner & al-rasheid 2006),
optically crosses paroral membrane in mid near buccal cirrus, cilia 30–40 µm long producing a
distinct bundle together with the pharyngeal fibres extending dorsally and to near mid-body (Fig.
177a, 178g, h, l, p, s; Table 63). Ontogenesis commences with minute anarchic ciliary fields left
of postoral midventral pairs (Fig. 179d, e).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality with a salinity of 10‰. The large
size suggests that B. litoralis is a litter species.

Remarks: Birojimia litoralis is a very distinct species differing from the three populations of
→ B. terricola by body shape (quadrangular with rounded ends, length:width ratio ~ 4.2:1 vs.
very elongate ellipsoid, ~ 5:1), the number of left marginal cirral rows (2 vs. 1), and many non-
overlapping or only slightly overlapping morphometric features, such as body size (x 235 ×
55µm vs. 150–180 × 35–40 µm in vivo), number of macronuclear nodules (116–210 vs. 42–111),
and number of adoral membranelles (x 48 vs. 37, 40–55 vs. 30–43).
→ Pseudobirojimia muscorum is much more slender than B. litoralis (x 7:1 vs. 4:1) and has
many non-overlapping morphometric features, for instance, the number of dorsal kineties (4 vs.
9) and the number of adoral membranelles (x 29 vs. 48).

Venezuelan and Brazilian specimens): Size in vivo about 150–180 × 35–40 µm; very elongate
ellipsoid (~ 5:1). Many (60–80) macronuclear nodules and several micronuclei. Cortical granules
within and between cirral and bristle rows, colourless, 2–3 × 1–2 µm in size. 4 to 6 right marginal
cirral rows. On average 9–13 midventral cirral pairs; 2 frontoterminal, 1 buccal, and 6–7 transverse
and pretransverse cirri; 3 caudal cirri; and about 37 adoral membranelles. 5–8 dorsal kineties, the
two leftmost bipolar, the others shortened forming the dorsal suture.
Description of Venezuelan site (25) population (Fig. 180a–e, i–l, 181a–e; Table 64)
Material deposited: 9 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens from Venezuela
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Further,
2 paratype slides and 2 voucher slides of the Japanese type population and of specimens from
Manaus (Brazil), respectively, have been deposited in the same repository. The specimens figured
and other relevant cells have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description: Size in vivo 150–240 × 30–60 µm, usually about 180 × 40 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 64 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage. Shape fairly constant, i. e., very elongate ellipsoid with posterior region slightly
more narrowed than anterior one, body length:width ratio 3.8–6.1, on average 4.5:1; laterally
flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 180a, b, i, j, 181a, c; Table 64). Nuclear apparatus mainly in postoral area
and along right and left body margin, composed of an average of 70 macronuclear nodules and
several micronuclei (Fig. 180k, 181a, c; Table 64). Macronuclear nodules globular to ellipsoid,
on average 4.8 × 3.1 µm in protargol preparations, some occasionally connected by fine strands
of membranous material; nucleoli globular, deeply impregnated. Likely more than 10 globular to
broadly ellipsoid micronuclei scattered between macronuclear nodules, difficult to identify due
to similar-sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole in left body margin
slightly anterior to mid-body, with long collecting canals extending to body ends (Fig. 180a).
Cortex very flexible, colourless. Cortical granules within and between cirral and bristle rows,
broadly ellipsoid to lenticular, 2–3 × 1–2 µm in size but difficult to recognize in vivo because
colourless and similar to small cytoplasmic lipid droplets (Fig. 180c, e); stain violet with methyl
green-pyronin and become up to 5 µm long when released; do not impregnate with protargol but

f–h) after protargol impregnation. a: Ventral view of a representative specimen, length 180 µm. The cell is studded with about
70 macronuclear nodules (not shown for the sake of clarity) and food vacuoles containing testate amoebae, flagellates, and
fungal spores. b: The cells are flattened up to 2:1. c: Shape of cortical granules, 2–3 × 1–2 µm in size. d: The cortical granules
do not impregnate with the protargol method used but appear as colourless structures in the cortex of deeply impregnated cells.
e: Surface view and optical section showing the cortical granulation. Although the granules are 2–3 × 1–2 µm in size, they are
difficult to recognize because they are colourless and have a similar refractivity as several cytoplasmic inclusions, especially
small lipid droplets. f–h: The dorsal kineties (numerals) form a distinct suture overlooked by berger & Foissner (1989). Three of
the four right side cirral rows are associated with dorsal bristles anteriorly (arrowheads). CC – caudal cirri, DB – dorsal bristles,
G – cortical granules. Scale bars 3 µm (d), 40 µm (g, h), and 100 µm (a, f).
stand out as colourless (whitish) structures from cortex of deeply impregnated specimens (Fig.
180d, 181d). Cytoplasm colourless, without crystals, studded with small lipid droplets 1–3 µm
in diameter and food vacuoles containing testate amoebae (Euglypha), heterotrophic flagellates
(Polytoma), ciliates, colourless and brown fungal spores, and possibly also bacteria (Fig. 180a).

flexibility.
Cirral pattern invariable, while some distances vary highly, e. g., anterior body end to right
marginal rows 1 and 4, anterior body end to posterior end of midventral complex, and posterior
body end to transverse cirri. Cirri 15–20 µm long in vivo, of similar size, except of frontal cirri,
most composed of two rows of basal bodies (Fig. 180a, i, j, 181a, c; Table 64). Three enlarged
frontal cirri in oblique row and a single, usually slightly enlarged cirrus III/2 posterior of right

frontal cirrus. Buccal cirrus at summit of paroral. Two frontoterminal cirri slightly right and
posterior to right frontal cirrus. Midventral complex composed of 9–15, on average 11 midventral
pairs, commences close posterior of cirrus III/2, extends slightly obliquely posteriorly, terminating
left of body midline at 56% of body length on average; right cirrus of pairs larger than left one;
no midventral row in 21 specimens investigated. On average six (extremes 2–9) transverse and
pretransverse cirri 6 µm anterior of posterior body and, of similar size as marginal cirri. Left
marginal row commences at level of buccal vertex, terminates in midline of rear body end. Four
right marginal rows: row 1 complete, i. e., without dorsal bristles anteriorly; cirri of rows 2–4
gradually replaced by dorsal bristles anteriorly (Fig. 180j, l, 181a; Table 64).
Dorsal bristles 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in 6–7 rows: rows 1 and 2 bipolar extending along left
body margin, likely associated with caudal cirri; rows 3–6(7) partially associated with a caudal
cirrus and with right marginal rows 2–4, as described above; most shortened anteriorly, forming
prominent suture with bipolar kinety 2 (Fig. 180j, 181b; Table 64). Caudal cirri inconspicuous.
Adoral zone of ordinary shape and structure, extends 30% of body length on average, composed
of an average of 35 ordinary membranelles, bases of largest membranelles about 10 µm wide in
vivo while 6–7 µm in protargol preparations; cilia of frontal membranelles about 20 µm long in
vivo. Buccal cavity moderately deep and wide, buccal lip of usual shape and size. Undulating
membranes long and slightly to moderately curved, intersect optically near or at level of buccal
cirrus; paroral composed of zigzagging dikinetids with cilia 13 µm long in vivo; endoral composed
of very narrowly spaced cilia 18 µm long in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres conspicuous, pharynx wall
studded with minute rods in protargol preparations, as in Caudiholosticha notabilis (Fig. 180a, i,
181, a, c; Table 64).
Morphometry of Brazilian site (18) population (Table 64): Most morphometrics of the
Venezuelan and Brazilian populations are more similar than those of the Japanese type population,
indicating some biogeographic specialization, for instance, body length and the number of cirri in
the marginal rows, the number and size of the macronuclear nodules, the number of midventral
pairs, the number of adoral membranelles, and the number of dorsal kineties.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at Japanese type locality, i. e., in brown soil of a deciduous
forest; at Venezuelan site (25); and at Brazilian site (18), indicating a preference for fertile habitats.
Comparison with type population: As discussed in the improved diagnosis of the genus,
berger & Foissner (1989) overlooked the specific dorsal ciliary pattern (Fig. 180f–h, 181b).
Further, berger & Foissner (1989) missed the cortical granules, as shown by a reinvestigation of
specimens from the type locality, where the granules stand out as colourless (whitish) structures
from the cortex of deeply impregnated specimens (Fig. 180d, 181d, e). Thus and because of
some well-matching morphometric data (Table 64), we consider the Venezuelan population as
conspecific with the Japanese type.

Pseudobirojimia nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Slender Bakuellidae with 1 left and 2 or more right marginal cirral rows. Midventral
complex composed of cirral pairs and a midventral cirral row. With 3 frontal cirri, frontoterminal,
buccal, transverse, and caudal cirri. Dorsal kineties in ordinary bipolar pattern.
Type species: Uroleptus muscorum Kahl, 1932.
Reference material: Foissner (1982) reinvestigated this species and deposited a slide (reg. no.
1984/79) with protargol-impregnated specimens from Austria in the Biology Centre of the Upper
Austrian Museum in Linz (LI), under the name Paruroleptus muscorum.
Remarks: Based on the redescription by Foissner (1982), berger & Foissner (1989) transferred
Uroleptus muscorum Kahl, 1932 to the genus Birojimia. However, berger (2006) recognized
that B. terricola (see above) and U. muscorum have a different midventral complex (without vs.
with a midventral row). Thus, he assigned U. muscorum only provisionally to Birojimia. The
reinvestigation of → B. terricola showed a further main difference, viz., a suture in the dorsal
kinety pattern (see above and Fig. 180f–h, 181b). As we now have two distinct differences, U.
muscorum is referred to a new genus, Pseudobirojimia, differing from the Holostichidae by the
midventral complex (midventral cirral pairs plus a midventral row vs. only midventral cirral
pairs), which matches that of the Bakuellidae. However, none of the bakuellid genera matches
P. muscorum in other features, i. e., has a left and at least two right marginal cirral rows and a
continuous adoral zone of membranelles (for a review, see berger 2006).
Bakuella pampinaria pampinaria eigner & Foissner, 1992
Observations on Brazilian site (26) population: Body size about 160 × 45 µm in vivo and 152
× 38 µm (SD = 19 × 7 µm, CV = 13 × 17%, Min = 135 µm, Max = 180 µm, n = 12) in protargol
preparations; many macronuclear nodules about 4–10 × 3–7 µm in vivo; contractile vacuole
distinctly anterior to mid-body, with two conspicuous collecting canals; cortex very flexible,
studded with rows of strongly refractive, slightly to distinctly yellowish granules about 0.5–1 ×
0.5–0.8 µm in size; feeds on ciliates (Gonostomum affine), flagellates (Polytomella sp.), and a
green alga with a mucous cover; glides rather rapidly on microscope slides; three to four oblique
ventral cirral rows, four to six buccal cirri, five to eight transverse cirri about 20 µm long and thus
slightly projecting from body proper; dorsal kinetids in three rows, bristles about 3 µm long in
vivo; oral apparatus conspicuous, composed of x = 38 adoral membranelles (SD = 4.3 µm, CV
= 11.3%, Min = 32 µm, Max = 45 µm, n = 10, protargol impregnation), a large and deep buccal
cavity, and paroral and endoral cilia 10 µm and 30 µm (!) long in vivo, respectively.
This population resembles B. pampinaria pampinaria in body size while the number of adoral
membranelles matches B. edaphoni (for details, see berger 2006). Thus, these species are either
synonymous or the Brazilian population represents a distinct subspecies. We do not fix any
possibility because the protargol preparations are poor and the absence of cortical granules is
unlikely in B. edaphoni.

in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Some relevant cells have been
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Pseudourostyla dimorpha nov. spec. (Fig. 182a–j, 183a–e; Tables 65, 66)
Diagnosis: Exists as a broad (length:width ratio ≤ 4:1) and as a slender (> 4:1) morph with very
similar morphometrics except for body size: on average 160 × 40 µm vs. 180 × 30 µm in vivo.
About 120 ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 5 micronuclei of similar size as macronuclear
nodules. Cortical granules mainly around cirral and bristle rows, colourless, 1–2 × 1.5 µm in
size. Midventral complex composed of an average of 8 cirral pairs and 9 cirri forming a bicorona.
Right and left of midventral complex 5 cirral rows each on average. About 4 dorsal kineties
and some caudal cirri. On average 2 buccal cirri and 6 transverse cirri about 10 µm distant
from rear end. Adoral zone extends about 30% of body length, composed of an average of 39

membranelles. Buccal cavity and undulating membranes in ordinary pattern. Pharynx surrounded
by minute, oblong structures.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (24), i. e., soil from a Tachypogon savannah about 50 km north of
the town of Puerto Ayacucho, 67°36‘W 5°41‘N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and paratype specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Greek numeral di (two) and the Greek substantive
morphe (shape), referring to the two morphs of P. dimorpha.
Description and remarks: The overall appearance of P. dimorpha is highly similar to P. franzi
Foissner, 1987a (reviewed in Berger 2006). Thus, we do not provide a live illustration and
“ordinary” description but refer to the diagnosis, the Figures (182a–j, 183a–e), the detailed
morphometry (Table 65), the comparison with P. franzi (Table 66), and the following text.
(i) P. dimorpha grew well in the non-flooded Petri dish culture for a month. Invariably, there
were broad and slender cells. Of 100 randomly selected specimens in a protargol preparation
28 had a length:width ratio of ≤ 4:1 and 72 were slender (> 4:1). The high number of slender
cells suggests them as the “typical” morph.
(ii) This is substantiated by the coefficients of variation. Of 42 usable features 28 were lower in
the slender than the broad specimens.

(iii) Except of body width, the two morphs are indistinguishable morphologically and
morphometrically (Tables 65, 66).
(iv) The nearest relative of P. dimorpha is very likely P. franzi Foissner, 1987. However, they
differ not only by the two morphs but also by some independent, non-overlapping main
features, viz., body length, the number of adoral membranelles and cirral rows in the right
and left cirral field, and by the location of the transverse cirri which are rather near to the
posterior body end in P. dimorpha and thus project from body proper (cp. Fig. 182a, h with
Fig. 182k; Table 66).
Caudiholosticha silvicola nov. spec. (Fig. 184d, e; Table 67)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 105 × 20 µm; pisciform to very narrowly obovate. On average 31
ellipsoid macronuclear nodules. Cortical granules only around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles,
colourless, about 0.5 µm across. Midventral complex composed of an average of 6 cirral pairs and
1 cirrus; on average 2 transverse cirri, 2 caudal cirri, and 4 dorsal kineties with kinety 4 strongly
shortened posteriorly. Adoral zone extends about 23% of body length, composed of an average of
17 membranelles. Buccal cavity wide and deep. Pharynx with minute, oblong structures.
Type locality: Needle litter and soil from a spruce forest in the surroundings of the town of Ulm,
Germany, 10°E 48°23’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the Latin nouns silva (forest) and incola
(inhabitant), referring to the habitat the species was discovered.

Remarks: berger & Foissner (1987) and berger (2006) described this population under the
names Paruroleptus notabilis and Caudiholosticha notabilis, respectively. We refer to these
descriptions, the diagnosis of the species, and Table 67.
berger & Foissner (1987) doubted the identification and suggested that it might be a distinct
species. This is emphasized by a Venezuelan population (see next species) which is distinctly
different in most features, as shown in Table 67. Specifically, C. silvicola is the smallest of the
three species recognized having, for instance, only half the adoral membranelles and marginal
cirri as the other species. Further, dorsal kinety 4 is strongly shortened posteriorly. Be careful not
to mix C. silvicola with C. paranotabilis which differs mainly by the narrow, flat buccal cavity
(Foissner et al. 2002).
Caudiholosticha halophila nov. spec. (Fig. 184a–c, f, g, 185a–d; Tables 67, 68)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 180 × 30 µm; pisciform to very narrowly obovate. On average 68
broadly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules. Cortical granules as in C. notabilis. Midventral complex
composed of an average of 14 cirral pairs and 4 cirri; on average 2 transverse cirri, 6 caudal
cirri, and 5 dorsal kineties with kinety 4 slightly shortened anteriorly. Adoral zone extends about
25% of body length, composed of an average of 35 membranelles. Buccal cavity wide and deep.
Pharynx with minute, oblong structures.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (54), i. e., saline soil from flooded coastal grassland in the Morrocoy
National Park, 67°13’W 11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the Greek noun halós (salt) and the Greek
adjective philos (preferring), referring to the saline habitat the species was discovered.
Description: In vivo, we identified this population as “large Uroleptus notabilis”, according to
the descriptions of Foissner (1982) and blatterer & Foissner (1988). However, the protargol
impregnations show that it is a new species, for which we cannot provide a live Figure because
we did not study the in vivo aspect in detail.
Size in vivo 150–250 × 25–40 µm, usually about 180 × 30 µm, as calculated from the morphometric
data in Table 68 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body very elongate obovate (length:width
ratio ~ 6:1) and frequently slightly sigmoid (Fig. 184a–c, 185a). Nuclear apparatus in central fifths
of cell, composed of an average of 68 globular to elongate ellipsoid (~ 3:1) macronuclear nodules
with ordinary nucleoli and about five scattered, globular to ellipsoid micronuclei (Fig. 184b, f,
185a–d; Table 68). Cortical granules present, similar to those of C. notabilis (see introduction to
description), form an up to 8 µm thick coat in most protargol-impregnated specimens (Fig. 185a).
Feeds on fungal spores, resting cysts of naked amoebae, and small ciliates (Odontochlamys
alpestris) digested in food vacuoles up to 20 µm in diameter (Fig. 185a).

a short additional row. d, e (from berger 2006): Caudiholosticha silvicola is much smaller than C. halophila and has thus only
half the adoral membranelles. Note the strongly shortened dorsal kinety 4. The arrow marks the posterior end of the midventral
complex. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, CC – caudal cirri, DK1 – dorsal kinety 1, FC – frontal cirri, FT – frontoterminal
cirri, MA – macronuclear nodules, MI – micronucleus, MR – midventral row, PF – pharyngeal fibres, TC – transverse cirri, 1–5
– dorsal bristle rows. Scale bars 20 µm (f, g) and 50 µm (a–c).
Cirri 10–13 µm long in protargol preparations, arranged in typical urostylid pattern (berger
2006). Midventral complex composed of an average of 14 pairs and 4 single, widely spaced cirri
forming a rather long row (Fig. 184a, 185b; Table 68). On average three distinctly enlarged frontal
cirri, three frontoterminal cirri, one buccal cirrus at mid-level of buccal cavity, two transverse
cirri near posterior body end, and six caudal cirri (Fig. 184a, f, 185a; Table 68). Dorsal bristles
about 5 µm long in protargol preparations, arranged in five bipolar rows, except of row 4 (rarely
row 3) rather distinctly shortened anteriorly (Fig. 184b, g; Table 68).
Adoral zone of ordinary shape, extends only 25% of body length on average, composed of about
533

35 ordinary membranelles with cilia 10–15 µm long in prepared cells. Buccal cavity wide and
deep. Undulating membranes moderately curved, optically intersect slightly posterior to mid-
buccal cavity, of very similar length (Fig. 184a, 185a, b). Pharynx commences slightly posterior
to buccal cirrus and extends over second third of body; pharyngeal wall studded with 1–2 µm
long rods, as typical for Caudiholosticha (Fig. 184a, 185b–d).
Occurrence and ecology: Obtained low abundance in the non-flooded Petri dish culture from
the type locality while it was numerous at site (47). Both sites are saline, suggesting saline soils
as the typical habitat.

Remarks: Caudiholosticha halophila differs significantly from the nearest known relative, C.
notabilis, by the following morphometrics (Table 67): number of midventral cirral pairs (14 vs.
8), number of cirri in midventral row (4 vs. 1), number of dorsal kineties (5 vs. 3–4), and number
of caudal cirri (6 vs. 3). Some of these features have a difference of ≥ 100%, suggesting species
rank for the Venezuelan population (Foissner et al. 2002).

Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country it was discovered, i. e., the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean
Sea.
Description: Size in vivo 130–230 × 20–40 µm, usually about 180 × 30 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 69 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage. Body shape very elongate rectangular or indistinctly ellipsoidal, length:width ratio
4.8–7:1, on average 5.8:1 (Fig. 186a, b, 187h; Table 69); flattened laterally about 2:1. Nuclear
apparatus left of body´s midline, forms a narrow ribbon commencing near buccal vertex and
extending subterminally, composed of an average of 18 globular to very elongate ellipsoid
macronuclear nodules and about four ellipsoid micronuclei with a size of about 6 × 4 µm in
vivo; macronuclear nodules in two rough rows one upon the other (Fig. 186a, b, f, 187a, b, e, g;
Table 69). Contractile vacuole about in mid-body at left body margin, with short collecting canals
538

extending anteriorly and posteriorly (Fig. 186a). Cortex very flexible and colourless. Cortical
granules arranged in dense rows forming a distinct, about 3 µm wide fringe, absent from cirral
areas, colourless, in vivo about 2.5 × 1 µm in size (Fig. 186c, d); impregnate more or less deeply
with the protargol method used, forming a 2–4 µm wide fringe (Fig. 187c, g, h); when extruded
drumstick-shaped and about 5 µm long, stain blue with methyl green-pyronin (Fig. 186e).
Cytoplasm hyaline with lipid droplets up to 10 µm across. Feeds on bacteria, fungal spores, and
ciliates digested in food vacuoles up to 30 × 20 µm in size. Glides rather rapidly on microscope
slide and soil particles, showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern as typical for genus and of ordinary variability (Fig. 186a, b, f, g, 187a, d, e, f;
Table 69). Midventral rows composed of 20 cirral pairs on average, end about 23% subterminally.
Marginal cirral rows usually almost touching at posterior end, caudal cirri occasionally indistinctly
separated from left marginal cirri. Invariably four slightly enlarged frontal cirri, two frontoterminal
cirri, one buccal cirrus, two pretransverse cirri, two transverse cirri, two caudal cirri, and four
bipolar dorsal kineties with 3–4 µm long bristles.
Adoral zone comparatively short, i. e., extends 27% of body length on average, of usual shape and
structure, consists of an average of 32 ordinary membranelles, first membranelle close to third
frontal cirrus. Buccal cavity narrow and flat; buccal lip inconspicuous covering some proximal
membranelles. Both undulating membranes comparatively short, straight, slightly overlap in
anterior quarter. Pharyngeal fibres inconspicuous in vivo and in protargol preparations (Fig. 186a,
187b; Table 69).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Appeared four weeks after rewetting
the sample (pH 6.8), indicating a k-selected life strategy.
Remarks: This species has a holostichid cirral pattern and two distinct caudal cirri. Thus, it
belongs to the genus Caudiholosticha berger, 2003. None of the 14 species classified by berger
(2006) into this genus strongly resembles C. virginensis. This applies also to the genus Holosticha,
which lacks caudal cirri. However, there are at least two Anteholosticha species which are quite
similar, except for the lack of caudal cirri: A. australis (blatterer & Foissner, 1988) and A. distyla
(buitKaMP, 1977a). Anteholosticha australis further differs from C. virginensis by the number of
transverse cirri (3–6 vs. 2). Anteholosticha distyla, which buitKaMP (1977a) discovered in soil
from the Ivory Coast (Africa), lacks cortical granules and caudal cirri (buitKaMP: “caudal cirri
totally absent”). However, heMberger (1982) reinvestigated the type material of A. distyla and
observed that the number of transverse cirri varies from two to four and that the three last cirri
of the left marginal row could be caudal cirri. Thus, only the presence vs. absence of cortical
granules remains as a distinct difference between C. virginensis and A. distyla. Unfortunately,
we cannot be sure about this difference because buitKaMP (1977a) did not make detailed live
observations, and thus he could have overlooked cortical granules in his species.

Paragastrostyla terricola (Foissner, 1988) berger, 2006 (Fig. 188a–i)
The specimens from Venezuelan site (62) match well the original description. However, they
are more slender: 100–130 × 10–20 µm, n = 5, 7.5:1 (vs. 80–140 × 15–30 µm, ~ 5:1) in vivo,
respectively, 80–120 × 10–12 µm, n = 8, 8.5:1 (vs. 91 × 16, 5.6:1) in protargol preparations. The
cortical granules are difficult to recognize because they are minute (~ 0.2–0.5 µm), colourless to
slightly yellowish, and occur mainly around the bases of the cirri and dorsal bristles. The granules
stain blue, but are not extruded, in methyl green-pyronin preparations. Some ordinary crystals
and lipid droplets accumulated in posterior region. Feeds on bacteria digested in vacuoles 3–5
µm across.
Two voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology
Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI).

2 ventral cirral rows commence subapically and end at 40% and 25% of body length, respectively,
composed of an average of 9 and 6 cirri, respectively. Right marginal row commences at level of
buccal cirrus, composed of an average of 22 cirri, left of 16. Dorsal bristles about 3 µm long, form
3 rows, row 1 commences at level of buccal vertex; 3 caudal cirri. Adoral zone of membranelles
gonostomoid, extends 36% of body length, proximal half covered by the distinctly convex buccal
lip, composed of an average of 19 membranelles. Buccal cavity narrow. Paroral and endoral
membrane side by side, the former composed of an average of 7 kinetids with 10 µm long cilia.

Type locality: Highly saline soil from the bank of the Rio Loa near to the town of Calama, Chile,
69°W 23°S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country in which it was discovered.

Description: Cladotricha chilensis was rather rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Further,
it was very fragile and became strongly inflated in ordinary protargol preparations. Thus, we
made a second fixation with osmic acid. This stabilized the body but the infraciliature became
poorly impregnated. Thus, we combined both preparations: osmic acid for body shape and related
features (e. g., length of adoral zone), stieve´s fluid for the infraciliature. But we obtained only
11 specimens for the morphological and morphometric analysis. All these drawbacks suggest a
redescription based on more and better preserved specimens.
Size in vivo about 60–90 × 10–15 µm, usually about 70 × 13 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 69a adding 10% preparation shrinkage. Body
very elongate ellipsoid with broadest site slightly posterior to mid-body and tail-like narrowed
posterior region; laterally not or slightly flattened (Fig. 188.1a–c; Table 69a). Nuclear apparatus
in central third of body. Two broadly to ordinarily ellipsoid macronuclear nodules with many
minute nucleoli. One to two micronuclei attached to macronuclear nodules, broadly ellipsoid
on average, rarely impregnated with the protargol method used (Fig. 188.1a, d; Table 69a).
Contractile vacuole in mid-body at left body margin (Fig. 188.1a). Cortex very flexible but not
contractile, without specific granules. Cytoplasm colourless, contains some yellowish crystals
mainly in tail region. Feeds on bacteria digested in vacuoles 4–6 µm across. Creeps and swims
slowly rotating about main body axis.
Cirri arranged in Cladotricha or Paragonostomum pattern shown by berger (2011), i. e., in two
frontoventral rows and one right and left marginal row; most cirri 8–10 µm long in vivo and
composed of two rows with three basal bodies each (Fig. 188.1a, c; Table 69a). Three enlarged
frontal cirri, first distinctly subapical and markedly enlarged; cirrus III/2 slightly enlarged, on top
or slightly left of left frontoventral cirral row; buccal cirrus anterior of undulating membranes.
Frontoventral cirral rows right of body´s midline, commence subapically, left row extends
about 40% of body length, right 25%, composed of an average of 9 and 6 cirri, respectively.
Right marginal row commences at level of buccal cirrus, composed of an average of 22 cirri
with intracirral distances distinctly increasing in posterior region; left marginal row as right but
composed of only 16 cirri on average (Fig. 188.1a, c; Table 69a).
Dorsal bristles in vivo 3 µm long, loosely spaced, form three rows each with an about 15 µm
long, fine caudal cirrus. Row 1 commences at level of buccal vertex, row 2 far subapically, and
row 3 subapically (Fig. 188.1d; Table 69a).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 1999), i. e., adoral zone flat and following anterior
and left body margin before bending abruptly into cell at 36% of body length; zone composed of
an average of 19 membranelles, frontal membranelles strongly beating, about 10 µm long, not
separated from almost immobile ventral membranelles with cilia about 10 µm long in anterior
half (Fig. 188.1a, c; Table 69a). Buccal cavity short and narrow, covered by the distinctly convex
buccal lip. Endoral membrane on dorsal wall of buccal cavity, composed of dikinetids, anterior
dikinetid with a short fibre touching buccal cirrus. Paroral membrane on convex part of buccal
lip, conspicuous because composed of an average of 7 kinetids with 10 µm long cilia. Pharyngeal
fibres distinct in vivo and in protargol preparations, extend slightly obliquely to mid-body,
possibly mixed with long endoral cilia (Fig. 188.1a, c; Table 69a).

Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. The sample consisted of highly
saline (> 30‰), red, very sandy soil and some plant residues.
Remarks: The generic classification of C. chilensis is uncertain because the genera
Paragonostomum and Cladotricha are insufficiently separated (berger 2011). To be sure that
our population represents a new species, we compared the species of both genera using the
monograph of berger (2011).
546

Cladotricha australis blatterer & Foissner, 1988 (Table 69a)
Material: Highly saline (> 30‰) soil from the Atlantic coast in the surroundings of the town of
San Julián, Argentina, 68°W 48°S. Three voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Remarks: The Argentinian specimens match perfectly the Australian population in all main
features. Only ventral cirral row 5 (anlage V) is distinctly shorter and has thus less cirri (mean: 11
vs. 18; extremes: 8–14 vs. 14–26; Table 69a). Considering the rather high variation coefficients
(CV = 14 vs. 20%), this difference is insufficient to separate the two populations at subspecies or
species level.
Cladotricha edaphoni wilbert, 1995 (Fig. 188.2a–d, 188.3a–d; Table 69b)
Material: 4 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens from Venezuelan site (65)
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Improved diagnosis (includes wilbert´s data): Size in vivo about 100 × 17 µm. Elongate ellipsoid
with posterior third distinctly narrowed. On average 17–20 scattered, ellipsoid macronuclear
nodules and 3–4 micronuclei. 3 frontal cirri, first distinctly subapical and enlarged; 1 buccal cirrus
far anterior of paroral membrane; 3 ventral cirral rows, rows III and V strongly shortened, each
composed of 3 to 8 cirri; row IV commences far subapically and extends to mid-body, composed
of 14–18 cirri on average; 3 caudal cirri. Right marginal row composed of an average of 25–29
cirri, left row of 19–22. Dorsal bristles about 2 µm long; in 3 rows, row 1 commences at level of
buccal vertex. Adoral zone gonostomoid, proximal third covered by strongly convex buccal lip,
extends about 28–34% of body length, composed of an average of 18–21 membranelles. Buccal
cavity minute; paroral membrane composed of 2–4 kinetids.
Description: We provide a full description of the Venezuelan population because wilbert´s
description is rather incomplete (see Remarks section).
Cladotricha edaphoni has a moderate variability with most variation coefficients smaller than
15%. Up to 20% and more concern mainly distances and the nuclear apparatus.
Size in vivo 70–130 × 15–25 µm, usually about 100 × 17 µm; shrunken to 59–93 × 10–17 µm, on
average 75 × 14 µm in protargol preparations, mainly due to ethanol fixation (Table 69b). Body
elongate ellipsoid with widest site slightly posterior to mid-body, just before distinctly narrowing
posteriorly; more or less curved and sometimes slightly contorted about main body axis,
especially when just taken from soil; slightly flattened dorsoventrally (Fig. 188.2a, b, 188.3a–d;
Table 69b). Nuclear apparatus in central quarters of cell. On average 20 globular to elongate
ellipsoid, scattered macronuclear nodules with conspicuous nucleoli. Two to four micronuclei
scattered among macronuclear nodules, broadly to ordinarily ellipsoid, rarely lightly impregnated
with the protargol method used (Fig. 188.2a, d, 188.3a–d; Table 69b). Contractile vacuole not
recognizable, very likely due to the high salinity. Cortex very flexible, without specific granules.

specimen, length 100 µm. The strongly convex buccal lip projects from body proper and covers the proximal third of the adoral
zone of membranelles. b–d: Ventral and dorsal view of holotype specimen, length 83 µm. Frontal cirrus 1 is gonostomoid (far
subterminal and enlarged) and the paroral membrane consists of only three kinetids. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, BC

macronuclear nodules, PM – paroral membrane, RM – right marginal cirral row, 1, 2, 3 – dorsal kineties, III, IV, V – ventral cirral
rows originating from anlagen III, IV, and V. Scale bars 30 µm.
Cytoplasm colourless, bright, contains some small lipid droplets and crystals mainly in posterior
quarter of cell; likely feeds on bacteria (Fig. 188.2a). Glides moderately rapid on microscope
slides and between soil particles, showing pronounced flexibility.
Cirri arranged in Cladotricha pattern shown by berger (2011), i. e., in five anlagen or rows with
all cirri composed of only four cilia (basal bodies) about 7 µm long in vivo, except of frontal
cirrus 1 (six basal bodies) and marginal cirri (two basal bodies) in posterior quarter of rows (Fig.
548

Fig. 188.3a–d. Cladotricha edaphoni, ventral views of protargol-impregnated specimens. Note the slender body, the many
macronuclear nodules, the subapically located and enlarged frontal cirrus 1, the three ventral cirral rows (III, IV, V), the
gonostomoid adoral zone, the minute buccal cavity and paroral membrane, and the absence of transverse cirri. The specimen
shown in (d) is slightly contorted about the main body axis. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, BC – buccal cirrus, BY – buccal
cavity, DK1, 3 – dorsal kineties, EM – endoral membrane, FC1–3 – frontal cirri, LM – left marginal row, MA – macronuclear
nodules, PM – paroral membrane, RM – right marginal cirral row, III, IV, V – ventral cirral rows originating from anlagen III, IV,
and V. Scale bars 25 µm.
188.2a–c, 188.3a–d; Table 69b). Anlage I produces frontal cirrus 1 located far subapically; anlage
II produces frontal cirrus 2 and a single buccal cirrus far anteriorly of undulating membranes;
anlage III produces frontal cirrus 3 and two to three cirri forming a short row; anlage IV longest,
composed of an average of 14 cirri, commences far subapically and ends slightly posterior of
mid-body; anlage V composed of four to five cirri forming a short row commencing subapically.
Right marginal row commences about 8 µm subapically and extends to posterior body end as
does left row (Fig. 188.2a–c, 188.3a–d; Table 69b).
549

Dorsal bristles about 2 µm long in vivo, arranged in three rows each associated with a caudal
cirrus composed of four, in vivo 10 µm long cilia. Row 1 commences at level of buccal vertex,
row 2 subapically, and row 3 near anterior body end; all rows end subterminally (Fig. 188.2a, d,
188.3a, b, d; Table 69b).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 1999), i. e., adoral zone flat and following anterior
and ventral body margin before bending abruptly into cell at about 28% of body length; zone
composed of an average of 18 membranelles with cilia of frontal membranelles in vivo about
10 µm long; frontal and ventral membranelles not separated by a gap (Fig. 188.2a–c, 188.3a–d;
Table 69b). Buccal cavity very short and narrow, cavity and proximal third of adoral zone covered
by the distinctly convex buccal lip. Endoral membrane slightly curved, composed of about 10
kinetids; paroral membrane left of anterior end of endoral, composed of only two to four kinetids.
Pharyngeal fibres distinct in protargol preparations, extend vertically to mid-body (Fig. 188.2a–c,
188.3a–d; Table 69b).
Occurrence and ecology: wilbert (1995) discovered C. edaphoni in the Coorong National Park
between the towns of Adelaide and Kingston, Australia. The sample was from a dry salt lake with
pH 8.8 and a salinity between 26 and 57‰. We found C. edaphoni in a highly saline (50‰, pH
5.8) soil sample (65) from the north coast of Venezuela. It became numerous in the non-flooded
Petri dish culture. Obviously, C. edaphoni is a hypersaline species well adapted to soil by the
slender and very flexible body.
Remarks: In his valuable review, berger (2011) synonymized Cladotricha edaphoni wilbert,
1995 with C. australis blatterer & Foissner, 1988. We disagree mainly because of the different
length of ventral row V (extends to level of buccal cirrus vs. to near posterior body end). Obviously,
this feature is constant across continents.
Most morphometrics of the Australian and Venezuelan specimens match well, except of body
size in vivo which is 90–125 × 32–49 µm. While the length match well, the width does not
(Table 69b). In our opinion, this has two reasons: (i) wilbert´s protargol method is excellent but
tends to inflate the specimens, (ii) although stated as “in vivo” measurements in the diagnosis,
the values are the same as in his Table 10 where the measurements are “based on protargol-
impregnated specimens”. Very likely, the same applies to his in vivo figure of C. edaphoni. He
did not recognize the large buccal lip and the body shape appears too general.
Taken together, we are convinced about the identification because the mismatches can be explained
by the sloppy observations of wilbert (1995).

552

each composed of about 5 cirri, row IV commences subapically and extends about 80 % of body
length, composed of 18 cirri on average. Right marginal row composed of 25 cirri on average,
left of 21. Dorsal bristles about 4 µm long, form 3 rows, row 1 commences at level of buccal
vertex; 3 caudal cirri. Adoral zone gonostomoid, proximal quarter covered by a convex buccal lip
with digitate margin, composed of an average of 23 membranelles. Buccal cavity narrow; paroral
membrane composed of 3 kinetids on average.
Type locality: Highly saline (~ 100‰) soil from a dry lagoon in the Santa Rosa National Park,
Costa Rica, 35°38’W 10°50’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective digitata (finger-shaped) refers to the curious processes of the
buccal lip.
Description: Cladotricha digitata has a moderate variability with most variation coefficients
smaller than 15%. Up to 20% and more are several distances and features composed of few
structures, e. g., the paroral membrane.
Size in vivo 75–120 × 20–30 µm, usually about 100 × 25 µm, as calculated from some live
measurements and the morphometric data (Table 69b) adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
shape moderately variable, basically elongate ellipsoid with posterior region distinctly narrowed
and curved right, producing a pisciform outline with widest region at begin of last third, i. e.,
just before narrowing (Fig. 188.4a, d, 188.5a, f; Table 69b). Nuclear apparatus in central quarters
of cell right of midline. Invariably four globular to ellipsoidal, on average broadly ellipsoid
macronuclear nodules usually in two distinct pairs and with ordinary nucleoli. Micronuclei
between and outside of macronuclear nodules, broadly ellipsoid, rarely impregnated with the
method used (Fig. 188.4a, c, 188.5a, b, d, f; Table 69b). Contractile vacuole not recognizable,
very likely due to the high salinity. Cortex very flexible, with bright granules around bases
of adoral membranelles, cirri, and dorsal bristles; individual granules colourless and oblong
with a size of about 1 × 0.5 µm in vivo (Fig. 188.4g, h); do not impregnate with the method
used. Cytoplasm colourless, contains some crystals and lipid droplets both 1–4 µm in size and
concentrated in posterior region. Food vacuoles globular to ellipsoid, 5–10 µm in size, most with
compact contents consisting of bacteria ordered side by side in the ellipsoidal vacuoles; rarely
vacuoles with loose contents (Fig. 188.4a). Glides slowly on microscope slides and between soil
particles, showing high flexibility.
Cirri arranged in Cladotricha pattern shown by berger (2011), i. e., in five anlagen or rows with
most cirri composed of four to six cilia (basal bodies) about 12 µm long in vivo (Fig. 188.4a,
b, e, 188.5a, b, d, f; Table 69b). Subapically three frontal cirri distinctly enlarged in about one
third of cells. Anlage I produces frontal cirrus 1 located distinctly subapical; anlage II produces
frontal cirrus 2 and a single buccal cirrus distinctly anterior of undulating membranes; anlage
III generates frontal cirrus 3 and an average of five cirri forming a short row; anlage IV longest,
composed of an average of 18 cirri, commences distinctly subapical and ends at 80% of body
553

length; anlage V composed of three to four cirri forming a short row commencing subapically and
extending near right body margin. Right marginal row commences about 12 µm subapically and
extends to near posterior body end as does left row (Fig. 188.4a, b, e, 188.5a, b, d, f; Table 69b).
Dorsal bristles 3–4 µm long in vivo, arranged in three rows each associated with a caudal cirrus
about 20 µm long in vivo. Row 1 commences at level of buccal vertex, row 2 subapically, and
row 3 near anterior body end; all rows extend to near posterior body end (Fig. 188.4c, h, 188.5c,
g; Table 69b).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 1999), i. e., adoral zone flat and following anterior
and left body margin before bending abruptly into cell at 31% of body length; zone composed
of an average of 23 membranelles with cilia of frontal membranelles about 15 µm long in vivo;
frontal and ventral membranelles not separated by a gap (Fig. 188.4a, b, e, f, 188.5a, b, d–f; Table
69b). Buccal cavity short and narrow, with a bright thickening in dorsal anterior region; cavity
and proximal third of adoral zone covered by a convex buccal lip with distal margin having
about 1 µm long digitate processes (Fig. 188.4f). Endoral membrane short and straight; paroral
membrane left of anterior end of endoral, composed of one to four, on average three kinetids
with 6 µm long cilia. Pharyngeal fibres distinct in protargol preparations, extend vertically to
mid-body.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, a highly saline habitat containing
several undescribed ciliate species.
Remarks: Cladotricha digitata has a special feature, viz., digitate processes on the buccal lip
as yet known from only one other genus, Schmidingerophrya Foissner, 2012a, a very curious
ciliate lacking most of the “typical” hypotrich features, even the dorsal bristles. This supports
the evolutionary scenario suggested by Foissner et al. (2014a) that Cladotricha is sister to
Schmidingerophrya with evolving dorsal bristles as main apomorphy. Interestingly, other
Cladotricha species lack the processes, suggesting their loss as a further evolutionary step
conducting to the gonostomatids. As the processes are difficult to recognize, we can state this
only for C. halophila where we definitely looked for this feature.
The identity of the species Cladotricha koltzowii gaievsKaia, 1925 is uncertain (berger 2011).
Our specimens lack three features of the type population (see berger 2011 for a review of all
species and authors mentioned in our discussion): a needle-like tail, a row of about 10 cirri close
to the adoral zone of membranelles, and two distinctly elongated frontal membranelles. Later,
ruinen (1938) redescribed C. koltzowii. Again, there are three mismatches with our specimens:
a short but sharp tail, frontal and ventral adoral membranelles separated by a distinct gap, and
two distinctly elongated frontal membranelles. Finally, borror & evans (1979) redescribed C.
koltzowii using a special nigrosin stain and protargol impregnation. The cirral pattern of the North
American specimens matches our data while the long paroral membrane does not. Accordingly,
the Costa Rican population is a new species.

n; Tables 69c, d)
Material: Highly saline soils from Venezuelan site (65) and Costa Rican site (28), i. e., litter
and grass roots from a highly saline, dry lagoon on the coast of the Santa Rosa National Park
(35°38’W 10°50’N). Three (Venezuela) and 3 (Costa Rica) voucher slides with protargol-
impregnated morphostatic and dividing specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of
the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The specimens illustrated and other relevant cells have
been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Improved diagnosis (based on three populations): Size in protargol preparations 138 × 30 µm
(Australian type pop.; AU) or about 70 × 20 µm (Venezuelan and Costa Rican pop.; VE, CR).

Very elongate ellipsoid with short, blunt tail slightly curved right. About 9 broadly ellipsoid
macronuclear nodules forming a moniliform strand right of body´s midline; 2 micronuclei. 3
frontal cirri; 1 buccal cirrus anterior of undulating membranes; 3 frontoventral cirral rows/anlagen:
row 3 short, does not extend beyond buccal vertex, composed of about 5 cirri; row 4 composed
of an average of 19 cirri (AU) or of about 13 cirri (VE, CR), row 5 composed of an average of 28
cirri (AU) or of about 22 cirri (VE, CR). Right marginal row composed of an average of 30 cirri
(AU) or of about 22 cirri (VE, CR), left row of about 20 cirri. Dorsal bristles 3 µm long; in 3 rows
with a caudal cirrus each. Adoral zone of membranelles gonostomoid, proximal half covered by
a convex buccal lip, extends about 36% of body length, composed of about 20–25 membranelles.
Buccal cavity very narrow; paroral membrane composed of about 4 kinetids.
Description: We provide a full description of the neotropic populations because wilbert`s
description is very short and thus incomplete. Further, the Venezuelan and Costa Rican population
will be described together because they are very similar in all features investigated (Tables 69c,
d). The variability is moderate (CV ≤ 15%) for most diagnostic features, except for the number
of paroral kinetids (CV up to 26%), the number of macronuclear nodules (CV 13 –18%), and the
number of micronuclei (CV ~ 50%).

Size highly variable, depending on culture conditions: in vivo about 80 × 25 µm in ordinary non-
flooded Petri dish cultures (NFP) while up to 140 × 30 µm in a flourishing semipure culture (Fig.
188.7a–f). Body shape also highly depending on culture conditions. Usually slightly sigmoid or
cuneate and distinctly narrowed posteriorly, forming a blunt, short tail slightly curved right; in
NFP cultures ellipsoid (up to 2.5:1) to elongate ellipsoid or cuneate (up to 4:1); in a semipure
culture very elongate ellipsoid to almost rod-shaped with a length:width ratio of up to 7:1 (Fig
188.7a–f). Laterally indistinctly flattened. Difficult to preserve, i. e., specimens become distinctly
inflated in protargol preparations, showing a length:width ratio of about 3.5:1 (Fig. 188.6b; Table
69c).
Nuclear apparatus in central quarters of cell right of body´s midline (Fig. 188.6a, c, 188.9a–c,
l–n). On average eight broadly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules forming a moniliform strand;

Some minute crystals scattered through body. Feeds on bacteria digested in vacuoles 4–6 µm
across (Fig. 188.6a, 188.7a–f). Usually creeping on bottom of culture dish and in and on mud
accumulations, showing great flexibility.

of an average of 21 highly differentiated membranelles (Fig. 188.6d, inset). Frontal membranelles
about 15 µm long, appear like thickened cirri in vivo (Fig. 188.6a, 188.7a–f). Anterior half of
ventral membranelles also about 15µm long, not separated from frontal membranelles; posterior
half of membranelles covered by a distinctly convex buccal lip projecting from body proper (Fig.
188.6a). Buccal cavity short and narrow in vivo, covered by buccal lip without digitate processes.
Endoral membrane short and more or less convex; paroral membrane minute, left of anterior end
of endoral, composed of an average of four kinetids with about 8 µm long cilia. Pharyngeal fibres
distinct in protargol preparations, extend vertically to mid-body (Fig. 188.6a, b, d, 188.7a–f,
188.8a, 188.9a, b, e, f; Table 69c).
Ontogenesis: We shall not provide a detailed description of the ontogenetic processes but restrict
it to important events and refer to the line drawings and micrographs for the more common
processes.
(i) The ontogenesis of C. halophila is apokinetal, i. e., an anarchic field of basal bodies develops
posterior to the buccal vertex without any participation of parental structures (Fig. 188.8b).
(ii) In the proter develop five cirral anlagen streaks as usual (Fig. 188.8c, d, 188.9c, d, g–i):
anlage I produces the new undulating membranes and frontal cirrus I; anlage II originates
from the buccal cirrus and produces frontal cirrus 2 and the new buccal cirrus; anlage III
originates within frontoventral cirral row 3 and produces frontal cirrus 3 and a new cirral
row 3; the anlagen IV and V are also produced within the parental rows 4 and 5. The opisthe
anlagen develop differently because the oral primordium generates only two cirral anlagen
and cirral row 3 of the proter does not reach the opisthe (Fig. 188.8c, d, 188.9c, d, g–i):
cirral anlagen I and II develop from the oral primordium and generate frontal cirri 1 and 2
as well as the buccal cirrus and the undulating membranes; anlage III is missing because
the frontoventral cirral row 3 produces only for the proter. Thus, proter anlage IV becomes
anlage III in the opisthe. Right of this anlage a new cirral row develops de novo becoming
cirral row 4 of the opisthe; anlage V develops within the parental row.
(iii) The ontogenesis confirms the absence of transverse cirri and the presence of caudal cirri one
each produced by the three dorsal kineties (Fig. 188.8g–j, 188.9h–k).
(iv) The further processes are as expected: cirri develop in the anlagen and the new cirral rows
migrate to the species-specific sites; the macronuclear mass divides three times to generate
eight nodules each in proter and opisthe; body shaping occurs post-divisionally, especially in
the proter (Fig. 188.8g–j, 188.9i–n).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in Australia (wilbert 1995), in Costa Rica, and in
Venezuela (this study) indicating wide or even cosmopolitan distribution. Likely confined to
highly saline coastal and inland habitats. In Venezuela it occurred only at site (65).
Remarks: The neotropic populations of Cladotricha halophila match the Australian type
population rather well, especially when the difference in body length is partially ascribed to
methodological problems (Table 69d). However, the higher number of cirri in all cirral rows
shows that the Australian specimens are indeed larger than those from Venezuela and Costa Rica.
On the other hand, important features such as the number of adoral membranelles, macronuclear
565

nodules, and paroral kinetids is quite similar (Table 69d). Thus, we do not separate the neotropic
and Australian populations.
As concerns the ontogenesis neither borror & evans (1979) or wilbert (1995) recognized the
de novo origin of a cirral row in the opisthe, possibly because they did not find division stages
like those shown in Fig. 188.8c, d and 188.9c, d, g, h.
Deviatidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Non-dorsomarginalian or dorsomarginalian hypotrichs with kahliellid organization,
i. e., with several longitudinal cirral rows dividing intrakinetally or with multiple within anlagen.
Transverse cirri absent, caudal cirri present or absent. The oral primordium originates within
the first row of the right cirral field or apokinetally between right and left cirral field. Four to six
frontoventral cirral anlagen partially reduced in Notodeviata.
Type genus: Deviata eigner, 1995.
Genera assignable: Deviata eigner, 1995, → Notodeviata nov. gen., and → Idiodeviata nov.
gen.
Remarks: Notodeviata is very likely closely related to → Idiodeviata and Deviata eigner, 1995
whose systematic position is not known, according to berger (2011), who puts much weight on
the presence/absence of dorsomarginal kineties. However, evidence is increasing that this feature
evolved several times independently (see → Idiodeviata). This is the basis for our decision to
unite Deviata, Notodeviata and Idiodeviata in a distinct family which is possibly sister to the
non-dorsomarginalian Kahliellidae tuFFrau, 1979.
Notodeviata nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Non-dorsomarginalian Deviatidae with frontal, buccal, and caudal cirri. The oral
primordium originates apokinetally between right and left cirral field. Four frontoventral cirral
anlagen, of which anlage IV and most cirri of anlagen II and III are resorbed in late and very late
dividers.
Type species: Notodeviata halophila nov. spec.
Etymology: Notodeviata is a composite of the Greek noun ho notos (the south) and the genus-
group name Deviata, referring to the geographic region the type species was discovered and to
its similarity to species of the genus Deviata. Feminine gender.
Remarks: Notodeviata differs from Deviata, as defined by eigner (1995) and berger (2011), by
the possession of caudal cirri, the apokinetal origin of the oral primordium, and the absence of
multiple within anlagen. Further, it is unique in the massive reduction of cirri in the frontoventral
anlagen. Most of these features suggest that Notodeviata evolved from a more complex ancestor
similar to Deviata.

dividing specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in
Linz (LI). The holotype, various paratypes, and the dividers shown have been marked by black
ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Greek noun hals (salt) and the Greek adjective philos
(loving, preferring), referring to the highly saline habitat (50‰) the species was discovered.

Description: Notodeviata halophila is ordinarily variable, i. e., most variation coefficients are ≤
15%, including all diagnostic features. Higher variation coefficients occur in many distances and
ratios, most of which have little taxonomic value.
Size in vivo 100–160 × 15–30 µm, usually about 120 × 17 µm, as calculated from various in
vivo measurements and protargol-impregnated specimens in Table 70 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage; as usual, also depends on culture conditions and fixation fluid. Body in vivo cultrate to
very narrowly ellipsoid (~ 7:1) with indistinctly slanted oral region, usually slightly wider anteriorly
than posteriorly, in protargol preparations vice versa and width distinctly inflated; hardly flattened
laterally (Fig. 189a, c1, d, 190a–k, p–t; Table 70). Nuclear apparatus in central quarters left of
body´s midline (Fig. 189a, e, 190p–t; Table 70). Two, very rarely three macronuclear nodules,
anterior nodule slightly posterior of adoral zone, second nodule slightly posterior of mid-body;

Fig. 190p–t. Notodeviata halophila after protargol impregnation. p–s: Ventral views, showing the ciliary pattern which consists
of three cirral rows right (R1–3) and two left (L1, 2) of body´s midline. Further, there are three frontal cirri and one buccal cirrus.
The macronuclear nodules have nucleoli mainly in the right half (see also [t]). t: Dorsal view, showing the two dorsal kineties
each with a caudal cirrus posteriorly. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, BC – buccal cirrus, CC – caudal cirri, DK2 – dorsal
kinety 2, EM – endoral membrane, FC – frontal cirri, L1, 2 – cirral rows left of body´s midline, MA – macronuclear nodules, PF
– pharyngeal fibres, PM – paroral membrane, R1–3 – cirral rows right of body´s midline, 1, 2 – dorsal kineties. Scale bars 30 µm.
Resting cyst (Fig. 189b, 190l–o; Table 70): Cysts in vivo perfectly spherical, on average 37
µm (without slime cover) or 42 µm (with slime cover) in diameter. Cyst wall 1–1.5 µm thick,
structureless in the light microscope, stains pink with methyl green-pyronin; “slime” cover
1–3 µm thick, very hyaline but rigid and thus possibly the ectocyst, does not stain with methyl
green-pyronin indicating a special (inorganic?) composition. Macronuclear nodules fused to a
central mass (Fig. 190n, o). Cytoplasm packed with lipid (?) droplets, as morphostatic cells, and
autophagous vacuoles up to 10 µm across.
Ontogenesis (Fig. 189f, 190u, v, x, 191a–o): The ontogenesis of N. halophila is rather simple,
well illustrated, and described carefully in the Figure explanations. Thus, we concentrate on the
important processes.
(v) The oral primordium originates apokinetally in mid-body between the right and the left cirral
field (Fig. 189f).

Fig. 190u–x. Notodeviata halophila after protargol impregnation. u, v (cp. Fig. 191a): Ventral view of early dividers with three
conspicuous cirral anlagen (I–III) in the opisthe. In the proter, the buccal cirrus becomes an anlage (asterisk). The arrowhead
marks an anlage in cirral row 2 of the proter. The arrow marks an anlage in dorsal kinety 1. w: Dorsal view of posterior region
of a morphostatic specimen. x: Ventral view of an early late divider which just resorbs anlage III. See Fig. 191i–k for a detailed
explanation. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, BC – buccal cirrus, CC – caudal cirri, DK1 – dorsal kinety 1, EM – endoral
membrane, FC – frontal cirri, L1, 2 – cirral rows left of body´s midline, MA – macronuclear nodules, OP – oral primordium,
PM – paroral membrane, R1,2 – cirral rows right of body´s midline, I–III – cirral anlagen. Scale bars 20 µm (w), 30 µm (v), and
40 µm (u, x).
(vi) Next, four cirral anlagen streaks develop in proter and opisthe. In the proter, anlage IV
very likely develops de novo; the opisthe anlagen develop from the oral primordium.
Concomitantly, anlagen are produced in all cirral rows and the dorsal kineties both in proter
and opisthe (Fig. 190u, v, 191a–f).
(vii) In mid-dividers and early late dividers, the anlagen develop cirri and dorsal kinetids generate
caudal cirri. Now, a curious process begins in the frontoventral anlagen II–IV of proter and
opisthe, viz., a large-scale resorption of the just produced cirri. It culminates in the complete
resorption of anlage IV and of most cirri in the anlagen II and III leaving three frontal cirri

Ventral and dorsal view of an early divider, showing two frontoventral anlagen (arrow, paroral membrane and buccal cirrus) in
the proter and three (I-III) in the opisthe. In the proter, cirral row R2 develops an anlage (a, arrowhead). Intrakinetal anlagen
develop in the dorsal kineties of the proter (b, arrowheads). c: Similar to (a) but a fourth cirral streak developed in the opisthe.
The arrowheads mark cirral anlagen in the proter. d: A late early divider, showing three frontoventral cirral anlagen in the proter
and four in the opisthe. The cirral rows R1, R2, R3 and L1 develop an anlage each in proter and opisthe (arrowheads). The arrow
denotes the parental anterior portion of cirral row R2. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, CC – caudal cirri, L1, 2 – cirral rows
left of body´s midline, MI – micronucleus, OP – oral primordium, R1, 2, 3 – cirral rows right of body´s midline, 1, 2 – dorsal
kineties, I–IV – frontoventral cirral anlagen. Scale bars 30 µm (c, d) and 40 µm (a, b).
and one buccal cirrus (Fig. 190x, 191g, j, k). On the dorsal side, the caudal cirri are formed,
one or two in each kinety (Fig. 191h, l, m, o).
(viii) Late dividers have resorbed most parental cirri that were not involved in anlagen formation
and most or all cirri in the frontoventral anlagen II–IV. Thus the morphostatic cirral pattern
is now well recognizable (Fig. 191n, o).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, a highly saline (~ 50‰) soil from
the north coast of Venezuela. The slender shape indicates that N. halophila is a “true” soil ciliate.
Remarks: Among the deviatids and kahliellids reviewed by berger (2011), Notodeviata is unique
in having the frontoventral ciliature reduced to three frontal cirri and one buccal cirrus (Fig. 189a,
b). Ontogenesis indicates that this is a young trait because much more cirri are produced but later
resorbed. The next similar species is → Idiodeviata venezuelensis which possesses three frontal

the opisthe. The cirral rows R1, 2, 3 and L1, 2, as well as the dorsal kineties divided intrakinetally. The anlagen for the undulating
membranes have developed and the new adoral zone of membranelles has been completed. g: Ventral view of a mid-divider
(dorsal view on next page) having four frontoventral cirral anlagen each in proter and opisthe; very likely, the fourth anlage of the

cirri, cirrus III/2, and one buccal cirrus.
In vivo, N. halophila is easily confused with → Idiodeviata venezuelensis (two vs. four
macronuclear nodules) and the binucleate Deviata species reviewed by berger (2011): D.
abbrevescens (macronuclear nodules ellipsoid vs. rod-shaped), D. bacilliformis (when binucleate;
without vs. with a short row of frontoventral cirri), and D. estevesi (slender vs. rather broad and
with four vs. many cirri in frontal area; possibly belongs to Parastrongylidium, see berger 2011
for a detailed discussion).

by contour, have been resorbed. The asterisk in (o) denotes two parental caudal cirri while the arrowheads mark new caudal cirri,

Idiodeviata nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Dorsomarginalian Deviatidae with frontoventral and buccal cirri. The oral primordium
originates apokinetally between right and left cirral field. Four frontoventral cirral anlagen. Dorsal
kinety 2 originates dorsomarginally. Caudal cirri absent.
Type species: Idiodeviata venezuelensis nov. spec.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Latin preposition idio (following its own way, strange)
and the Latin adjective devius (aside its way, special, curious), emphasizing the differences to →
Notodeviata. Feminine gender.
578

Remarks: Idiodeviata is very likely closely related to → Notodeviata, differing by the absence
of caudal cirri and an only slight resorption of newly produced cirri in the frontoventral anlagen.
This combination of features, to which the apokinetal production of the oral primordium and the
dorsomarginally generated dorsal kinety 2 must be added, is unique to Idiodeviata, separating it
from all kahliellids s. l. and the deviatids reviewed by berger (2011).
Possibly, Deviata rositae KüPPers et al., 2007 very likely belongs to Idiodeviata because it has
the same ciliature, including cirrus III/2. However, a transfer would need ontogenetic data on the
oral primordium and dorsal kinety 2.
Idiodeviata venezuelensis nov. spec. (Fig. 192a–t, 193a–c; Table 70)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 20 µm. Very narrowly ellipsoid, hardly flattened laterally. 4
macronuclear nodules frequently forming two indistinct pairs each with a micronucleus between
macronuclear pairs. 3 cirral rows each right and left of body´s midline; 3 frontal cirri; 1 buccal
cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane; and with cirrus III/2. 2 dorsal kineties; kinety
1 bipolar, kinety 2 reduced to 2 subapical bristles. Adoral zone extends 24% of body length,
composed of an average of 19 membranelles. Buccal cavity short and narrow. Paroral and endoral
membrane optically side by side but staggered by about 30%.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (65), i. e., highly saline soil from the north coast, Morrocoy NP,
surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, 67°13‘W 11°33‘N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 5 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated morphostatic and
dividing specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in
Linz (LI). The holotype, various paratypes, and the dividers shown have been marked by black
ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country in which it was discovered, i. e., Venezuela.
Description: Idiodeviata venezuelensis occurred in the same sample as → Notodeviata halophila
but was less abundant. Although we recognized specimens with two or four macronuclear nodules
during live observation, we did not separate them because the other features were highly similar
and the number of macronuclear nodules is sometimes rather variable in this group of hypotrichs
(berger 2011). However, protargol impregnation revealed two distinct species but we had already
abandoned the sample. Thus, we cannot provide specific in vivo data. However, I. venezuelensis
is in vivo very similar to → N. halophila, except for the number of macronuclear nodules.
The sample was fixed with ethanol which made clear protargol preparations but poorly preserved
body size and shape, specifically most cells became strongly inflated. Thus, we cannot provide
exact in vivo size and shape data but emphasize the overall similarity with → N. halophila which
is likely slightly longer and thinner than I. venezuelensis.
Cirri about 10 µm long in protargol-impregnated cells. Frontoventral cirri and first cirri of
longitudinal rows usually slightly thickened, i. e., composed of 6–8 cilia; main portion of rows
with cirri composed of four cilia; most cirri of rear portion composed of only two cilia. Intracirral

that the ontogenetic processes may have a slightly different time-table: the specimen shown in (h) has four cirral anlagen in the
opisthe and is just commencing anlagen formation in the left cirral row 1 and in dorsal kinety 1 (arrowheads); the specimen shown
in (i) has only three opisthe cirral anlagen while the anlagen in the right cirral rows are already distinct (arrowheads). j, k: Ventral
and dorsal view of same specimen. Distinct anlagen developed in proter, in all cirral rows, and in dorsal kinety 1 (arrowheads). l,

macronuclear mass (Fig. 192p) elongates and the micronuclei commence division. Dorsal kinety 1 has been generated by within
anlagen while kinety 2 has been produced dorsomarginally. s, t: Ventral and dorsal view of a late divider, showing the first
round of macronuclear division and the second round of micronuclear division. The new ciliature is finished and most cirri that
were not involved in anlagen formation have been resorbed. The arrow marks the posterior, not yet resorbed cirri of the parental
frontoventral cirral row. AS – anterior segment of anlage IV, AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, DK1, 2 – dorsal kineties, EM

distances hardly increase from anterior to posterior. Cirri arranged in three nearly bipolar rows
each right and left of a wide, barren stripe in body´s midline, except of right row 1 extending only
33% of body length on average (Fig. 192a, b, d–g, 193a–c; Table 70).
Dorsal bristles 3 µm long in protargol-impregnated cells, arranged in two rows without caudal
cirri (Fig. 192c, d, 193c). Row 1 slightly shortened anteriorly, composed of an average of 16
dikinetids with intrakinetid distances slightly increasing from anterior to posterior. Row 2
distinctly subapical, composed of only two dikinetids.
Oral apparatus small compared to length of cell, i. e., adoral zone extends only 24% of body
length, composed of an average of 19 ordinary membranelles with largest bases about 5 µm wide
and cilia about 10 µm long in protargol preparations (Fig. 192a, b, 193a, b; Table 70). Buccal
cavity short and narrow, likely covered by a convex lip. Paroral and endoral membrane slightly
curved, side by side but staggered by about 30%. Pharyngeal fibres extend obliquely backwards,
about 25 µm long.
Ontogenesis (Fig. 192c–t): The ontogenesis of I. venezuelensis is well illustrated and described
in the Figure explanations. Thus, we concentrate on the diagnostic processes.

Fig. 193a–c. Idiodeviata venezuelensis after protargol impregnation. a, b: Ventral views, showing the infraciliature and the
nuclear apparatus. The arrow in (a) marks a supernumerary cirrus. c: Dorsal infraciliature. Dorsal kinety 2 consists of only two
kinetids which originate dorsomarginally. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, BC – buccal cirrus, DK1, 2 – dorsal kineties, EM
– endoral membrane, L1, 3 – cirral rows left of body´s midline, MA – macronuclear nodules, MI – micronuclei, PF – pharyngeal
fibres, PM – paroral membrane, R1–3 – cirral rows right of body´s midline, III/2 – second cirrus of anlage III. Scale bars 30 µm.
(i) The oral primordium originates apokinetally in mid-body between the right and the left cirral
field (Fig. 192e).
(ii) Next, four cirral anlagen each develop in proter and opisthe (Fig. 192f–j, l, n, o, q). In the
proter, anlage I originates from the parental undulating membranes, anlage II develops from
the buccal cirrus, anlage III very likely originates from cirrus III/2, and anlage IV is generated
either de novo or from the anteriormost cirrus of right cirral row 1. In the opisthe, the four
anlagen originate from the oral primordium. Anlage IV, which generates the short right cirral
row 1, originates in two steps in proter and opisthe: anteriorly, three cirri from anlage IV form
584

an anterior segment; then, a posterior segment with four to six cirri is generated (de novo?)
and usually slightly dislocated to the right, producing an inconspicuous break recognizable
also in most morphostatic specimens and in early dividers (Fig. 192e, f).
(iii) Concomitantly with the production of the frontoventral cirral anlagen those of the ordinary
cirral rows and of dorsal kinety 1 are generated right of the parental rows in the right field,
within the rows in the left.
(iv) In middle and late dividers, dorsal kinety 2, which consists of only two kinetids, is generated
dorsomarginally (Fig. 192p, r, t); however, we cannot entirely exclude a de novo origin
because the minute details are very difficult to interpret.
(v) Late dividers have resorbed most parental cirri that were not involved in anlagen formation
and two to four supernumerary cirri in anlagen I–III. Thus, the morphostatic cirral pattern is
now well recognizable (Fig. 192s, t).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, a highly saline (~ 50‰) soil from the
north coast of Venezuela. The moderate size and the slender shape indicate that I. venezuelensis
is a “true” soil ciliate.
Remarks: In vivo, Idiodeviata venezuelensis is very similar to → Notodeviata halophila, except
for the number of macronuclear nodules (four vs. two). Further, I. venezuelensis is easily confused
with several quadrinucleate Deviata species (see berger 2011 for the species now mentioned):
D. bacilliformis (6 vs. 10 postoral cirral rows), D. quadrinucleata (6 vs. 10 postoral cirral rows),
D. brasiliensis (first cirral row right of body´s midline ends anterior vs. posterior of mid-body,
dorsal kinety 2 reduced to two anterior dikinetids vs. bipolar), D. spirostoma (~ 20 vs. 45–50
adoral membranelles, body length in vivo about 100 vs. 180 µm), and D. polycirrata (body size
in vivo about 100 × 20 µm vs. 152 × 62 µm, about 20 vs. 43 adoral membranelles, 6 vs. 9–13
postoral ciliary rows).
Generally, this type of hypotrichs is difficult to identify in vivo, and there might be further such
species not yet described. Thus, the identification should be checked in protargol preparations.
Deviata brasiliensis siqueira-Castro et al., 2009 (Fig. 194a–d, 195a–n; Table 71)
Material: 4 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens from Venezuelan site (56)
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Observations and Remarks on a Venezuelan population: Deviata brasiliensis Siqueira-
Castro et al., 2009 has been discovered in Brazil and is characterized, according to the original
description, by having 4 (2–6) macronuclear nodules; 1 (1–3) parabuccal cirrus; 7 (7–11) long
cirral rows of which the innermost right row (R4) is posteriorly shortened; 22 (18–31) adoral
membranelles; and 2 dorsal kineties, with kinety 2 anteriorly shortened and its posterior kinetids
very widely spaced.
Detailed morphometric data on Deviata brasiliensis from Venezuelan site (56) are presented
and compared with specimens from the Brazilian type population (Table 71). The cultivated

Scale bars 50 µm.
Venezuelan specimens have a highly variable length:width ratio (Fig. 194a–d, 195a–d),
depending on the amount of food ingested. Slender specimens (length:width ratio 3.8–7.8) with
an ordinary number of food vacuoles make 83 % of the population (n = 393) while 17 % of the
cells are studded with starch grains and are thus oblong (length:width ratio < 3.8). Besides the
length:width ratios of body and macronuclear nodules, no differences occur between the slender
and the oblong individuals.
In general, the Venezuelan population is less variable then the type population, as shown by
the lower coefficient of variation for almost every character studied (Table 71). For example,
more than one parabuccal cirrus or more than three long cirral rows left of the adoral zone are

b Row L4 with 25–30 cirri was found in five slender and two oblong Venezuelan specimens (type population 13–34 cirri,
x = 26, n = 25). Row L5 with 26–35 cirri was found in two slender and one oblong specimen (cirri of this row were not
counted in the type population).
not uncommon in the type population but rare in the Venezuelan specimens. The Venezuelan
population possesses constant characters, e. g., four long cirral rows right of the adoral zone and
two dorsal kineties while both are slightly variable in the type population. The two isolated cirri
between rows R4 and L1 are ciliated, contrary to the original description (Fig. 195h).
siqueira-Castro et al. (2009) state that the oral primordium of D. brasiliensis usually originates
within cirral row R4 and incorporates its posterior cirri. Although we cannot exclude that some
cirri of row R4 contribute to the oral primordium, we found the posterior cirri still intact in
mid-dividers (Fig. 195e, g). The ontogenesis (Fig. 195e–g) follows the pattern described for D.
abbrevescens (eigner 1995, Fig. 194e); we did not find evidence for the deviations reported by
siqueira-Castro et al. (2009): anlage IV of the proter originates at the anterior end of parental
row R4 and extends obliquely to parental row R5, later incorporating its cirri (vs. incorporating
only cirri of row R4); anlage V of the proter originates within parental row R6, extending through
incorporation of cirri from the latter (vs. originating at anterior end of row R5). The origin of
anlagen IV and V of the opisthe was not unambiguously determined by siqueira-Castro et al.
(2009). Our observations showed clearly the D. abbrevescens pattern, that is, anlage IV originates
within parental row R5 and anlage V originates within row R6, extending to row R5 and later
detaching from row R6 (Fig. 194e, 195e, g).
As yet, SEM illustrations of D. brasiliensis were not available. Thus, we show some overviews
and details in Fig. 195h–n. For details, see figure explanations.
Occurrence and ecology: The type locality of D. brasiliensis is a sewage treatment plant in Rio
de Janeiro (Brazil), where it was discovered in the primary settling tanks (27.8 °C, pH 7, 2.2 mgl-
1 O ). Siqueira-Castro et al. (2009) also reported it from ordinary limnetic samples, coexisting
2
with Paramecium aurelia and testate amoebae. We found D. brasiliensis in slightly saline (4 ‰)
soil and mud from ephemeral puddles on the north coast of Venezuela, Morrocoy National Park,
67°13’W 11°33’N.

Bistichella BerGer, 2008
Improved diagnosis: Hypotricha with 2 or 3 short frontal cirral rows and 2 or 3 long frontoventral
cirral rows, of which the right one may be interrupted in mid-body or reduced to a short posterior
segment. 3 or 4 enlarged frontal cirri and more than one buccal cirrus. With a right and a left
marginal cirral row. Adoral zone of membranelles continuous, buccal cavity conspicuous because
± cyrtohymenid-shaped. Dorsal kinety pattern of Gonostomum-type, i. e., several bipolar rows.
Caudal, transverse, and postperistomial cirri lacking.
Type species (by original designation): Paraurostyla buitkampi Foissner, 1982.
Species assignable: Bistichella buitkampi (Foissner, 1982) berger, 2008; B. chilensis nov. spec.,
B. humicola (gellért, 1956) berger, 2008; B. kenyaensis nov. spec.
Remarks: See genus → Parabistichella. Briefly, Bistichella and Parabistichella differ by the
absence vs. presence of transverse cirri.
Bistichella chilensis nov. spec. (Fig. 196a–c; Table 72)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 140 × 50 µm; elongate ellipsoid. 2 macronuclear nodules and about
5 micronuclei. 2–3 short frontal cirral rows and 2 long frontoventral rows; right frontoventral row
with a wide break in mid-body. 4 enlarged frontal cirri and an average of 9 cirri in short frontal
rows. On average, 23 cirri in left frontoventral row, 15 + 10 cirri in right frontoventral row, 4
buccal cirri, 43 cirri in left and 46 cirri in right marginal row. Adoral zone short, i. e., extends
about 27% of body length, composed of 30 membranelles on average. 3 dorsal kineties.
Type locality: Soil from a dry area of the Fray Jorge National Park in the surroundings of the
town of Coquimbo, Chile, 72°W 30°S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country where it was discovered.
Description: The species was very rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Thus, only nine
specimens could be analysed morphometrically in the protargol slides (Table 72).
Size in vivo 120–170 × 35–55 µm, usually about 140 × 50 µm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 72 adding 15% preparation shrinkage.
Body slenderly ellipsoid to almost rectangular, left margin usually slightly convex, both in vivo
and in protargol preparations (Fig. 196a–c). Two, rarely three macronuclear nodules in central
quarters of cell and left of body´s midline; individual nodules ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid;
with many small nucleoli. Two to nine globular to broadly ellipsoid micronuclei attached to and
around macronuclear nodules (Fig. 196a, c; Table 72). Contractile vacuole in mid-body at left

droplets and large food vacuoles containing flagellates (Polytoma) and middle-sized ciliates, e.
g., Leptopharynx costatus and Protocyclidium muscicola (Fig. 196a). Moves rapidly, showing
pronounced flexibility.
Cirri about 15 µm long in vivo, comparatively fine, i. e., most consisting of only two rows of
basal bodies, arranged in Bistichella pattern, showing three peculiarities (Fig. 196a, c): (i) four
enlarged frontal cirri, (ii) two to three short frontal cirral rows composed of 6–13, on average
of 9 cirri, (iii) right frontoventral cirral row interrupted in mid-body, anterior segment slightly
convex and composed of 12–18, on average 15 cirri; posterior segment rather distinctly curved

posteriorly and composed of 6–18, on average 10 cirri. Cirri narrowly spaced in anterior half of
marginal rows, right row curves around posterior body end almost touching left row. Number of
cirri within rows highly variable (CV > 15%, Table 72).
Dorsal bristles about 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in three bipolar rows commencing subapically,
extend at body margin and in body midline. Caudal cirri absent (Fig. 196c; Table 72).
Adoral zone comparatively short, i. e., extends 23–31%, on average 27% of body length, of usual
shape and structure, consists of an average of 30 membranelles, bases of largest membranelles
about 11 µm wide in vivo, first membranelle close to third enlarged frontal cirrus. Buccal cavity
conspicuous in vivo because Cyrtohymena-shaped, i. e., with distinctly curved anterior portion;
partially covered by buccal lip with thickened margin. Both undulating membranes rather distinctly
curved optically intersecting in mid of buccal cavity, kinetids very narrowly spaced. Pharyngeal
fibres distinct in vivo and after protargol impregnation, of ordinary length and structure (Fig.
196a, b; Table 72).

Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality.
Remarks: There is only one congener similar to B. chilensis, viz., → B. kenyaensis, providing
a good example for biogeographic speciation. Bistichella kenyaensis is smaller than B. chilensis
(90 × 36 µm vs. 121 × 40 µm in protargol preparations, Table 72) and has thus a lower total
number of cirri (107 vs. 154), while the number of adoral membranelles is rather similar (24 vs.
30); further, the frontoventral rows are more distinctly reduced: left row composed of 13 vs. 23
cirri, right row composed of 12 + 4 vs. 15 + 10 cirri (Table 72). Additionally, the posterior end
of the marginal cirral rows is different: the right row curves around the body end in B. chilensis,
while either the left row curves around the body end or both rows are shortened, leaving a wide
space in → B. kenyaensis (Fig. 196b, 197b, c).
The cirral pattern, of course, resembles several species which, however, have four macronuclear
nodules (B. buitkampi) or transverse cirri (Bistichellides terrestris, → B. brevisticha). In vivo,
B. chilensis can be confused not only with → Bistichellides species (without vs. with transverse
cirri) but also with various other massive hypotrichs, such as Uroleptoides polycirratus (two
vs. one long frontoventral cirral rows, without vs. with transverse cirri). Thus, the identification
should be controlled in protargol preparations.

Bistichella kenyaensis nov. spec. (Fig. 197a–f; Table 72)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 110 × 45 µm; ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid. 2 macronuclear nodules
and 3 micronuclei on average. 2–3 short frontal cirral rows and 2–3 long frontoventral rows; right
frontoventral row with very wide break in middle quarters of body. 3 enlarged frontal cirri and an
average of 5 cirri in short frontal rows. On average, 13 cirri in left frontoventral row, 11 + 4 cirri
in right frontoventral row, 3 buccal cirri, and about 33 cirri each in left and right marginal row.
Adoral zone extends on average 30% of body length, composed of 24 membranelles on average.
3 dorsal kineties.
Type locality: Litter and soil from the surroundings of the Kilimanjaro Lodge in Kenya, tropical
Africa, 37°E 3°S.

cirral row. Note the distinct fibres originating from the membranelles neighbouring the deep buccal cavity. f: Lateral view of
specimen shown in Fig. 197a. DK1 – dorsal kinety 1, MI – micronuclei. Scale bars 40 µm.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country where it was discovered.
Description: Although the cirral pattern of most specimens looks like shown in Fig. 197d, we
present also two rare variations (Fig. 197b, c) not included in the morphometric analysis.
Size in vivo 90–130 × 35–50 µm, usually about 110 × 45 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 72 adding 15–20% preparation shrinkage.
Body shape ellipsoid to slenderly ellipsoid but usually widest anterior of mid-body; left body
margin frequently more convex than right; laterally flattened about 0.5:1 (Fig. 197a, d, f; Table
72). Two macronuclear nodules in central quarters of cell and left of body’s midline; individual
nodules broadly to slenderly ellipsoid; with many small nucleoli. Two to seven globular to
broadly ellipsoid micronuclei attached to and near macronuclear nodules (Fig. 197a–c, e; Table
597

72). Contractile vacuole slightly anterior of mid-body. Cortex very flexible, without specific
granules. Cytoplasm colourless and without crystals, studded with up to 10 µm-sized, bright
inclusions and some food vacuoles containing heterotrophic flagellates and middle-sized ciliates,
e. g., Colpoda maupasi (Fig. 197a).
Cirri about 15 µm long in vivo, comparatively fine, i. e., most consisting of only two rows of basal
bodies, arranged as in → B. chilensis, but more variable and average total number of cirri much
lower (154 vs. 107). Gap in right frontoventral cirral row much wider than in → B. chilensis.
Distances between marginal cirri gradually increase from very narrowly anteriorly to ordinarily
posteriorly. Left marginal cirral row curves around posterior body end or both marginal rows
slightly shortened leaving blank body end (Fig. 197a–d; Table 72).
Dorsal bristles about 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in three bipolar rows commencing subapically
and ending subterminally, extend at body margin and in body midline. Caudal cirri absent (Fig.
197e; Table 72).
Adoral zone extends 23–39%, on average 30% of body length, of usual shape and structure,
consists of an average of 24 membranelles, bases of largest membranelles about 10 µm wide
in vivo, first membranelle close to third enlarged frontal cirrus. Buccal cavity conspicuous in
vivo because Cyrtohymena-shaped, i. e., with distinctly curved anterior portion; partially covered
by buccal lip with thickened margin. Both undulating membranes distinctly curved optically
intersecting in mid of buccal cavity, kinetids very narrowly spaced. Pharyngeal fibres distinct in
vivo and after protargol impregnation, of ordinary length and structure (Fig. 197a–d; Table 72).
Notes on ontogenesis: Stomatogenesis begins with the production of basal bodies along the
postoral portion of the left frontoventral row whose cirri are incorporated in the anlage.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in a mixture of grass and
leaf litter and slightly alkaline soil (pH 8 in water) from the upper 5 cm. Soil grey, fine-grained,
possibly of volcanic origin. Collected on 8. 7. 1985, investigated 1986.
Comparison with similar species: See → B. chilensis!
Parabistichella jiang et al., 2013
Improved diagnosis: Hypotricha with 2 or 3 short frontal cirral rows and 2 or 3 long frontoventral
cirral rows, of which the right one may be interrupted in mid-body or reduced to a short posterior
segment. 3 or 4 enlarged frontal cirri and more than one buccal cirrus. With transverse cirri and
a right and a left marginal cirral row. Adoral zone of membranelles continuous, buccal cavity
conspicuous because ± cyrtohymenid. Dorsal kinety pattern of Gonostomum-type, i. e., several
bipolar rows.
Type species (by original designation): Parabistichella variabilis jiang et al., 2013.
Species assignable: jiang et al. (2013) included only the type species in Parabistichella. However,
there are several Bistichella species that match the diagnosis of jiang et al. (2013): Parabistichella
598

encystica (Fan et al., 2014) nov. comb. (basionym: Bistichella encystica Fan et al., 2014); → P.
bergeri bergeri nov. sspec.; → P. bergeri brevisticha nov. sspec.; P. dieckmanni (Foissner, 1998)
nov. comb. (basionym: Keronopsis dieckmanni Foissner, 1998); → P. namibiensis (Foissner,
agatha & berger, 2002) nov. comb. (basionym: Amphisiella namibiensis Foissner, agatha &
berger, 2002); P. procerus (berger & Foissner, 1987) nov. comb. (basionym: Pseudouroleptus
procerus berger & Foissner, 1987); P. terrestris (heMberger, 1985) nov. comb. (basionym:
Pseudouroleptus terrestris heMberger, 1985).
Remarks: The diagnosis is adapted to the monograph of berger (2008), who founded Bistichella
with five species, most having transverse cirri, except of the type species (B. buitkampi) and the
questionable B. humicola. We discovered two subspecies with transverse cirri. As the presence
vs. absence of transverse cirri is usually considered as a generic character (berger 1999, 2008,
2011), we classify species with transverse cirri into the genus Parabistichella as diagnosed above.
Very likely, all Bistichella and Parabistichella species lack caudal cirri. Occasionally, there are
some cirri at the posterior end but these likely belong to a ventral or marginal row (Fig. 199h).
Like berger (2008), we do not have a solid idea about the nearest relatives of Bistichella and
Parabistichella. The molecular data indicate a statistically poorly supported relationship with
Uroleptoides and Orthoamphisiella (jiang et al. 2013, Fan et al. 2014).
Parabistichella bergeri nov. spec.
Diagnosis(of two subspecies): Size of cultivated specimens in vivo about 215 × 80 µm;
length:width ratio 2.4 or 3.6:1 in protargol preparations; ellipsoid. 2 macronuclear nodules and 3
micronuclei. On average 8 or 5 buccal cirri, 5 transverse cirri, 60 cirri in right marginal row, 50 in
left; total number of cirri 203 or 180 on average. About 30 or 21 bristles in dorsal kinety 1. Adoral
zone extends about 30% of body length, composed of an average of 50 or 38 membranelles.
Buccal cavity rather wide and deep. Resting cyst globular, in vivo about 40 µm across; wall
smooth.
Remarks: We split Parabistichella bergeri into two subspecies mainly due to the non-overlapping
number of adoral membranelles.
Parabistichella bergeri bergeri nov. subspec. (Fig. 198a–d, 199a–n; Table 73)
Diagnosis: Length:width ratio about 2.4:1 in protargol preparations. On average a total of 203
cirri including 8 buccal cirri; 30 bristles in dorsal kinety 1. Adoral zone composed of an average
of 50 membranelles.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (66), i. e., highly saline (63‰) soil from the outskirts of the village
of Chichiriviche, 67°13’W 11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

monographs will live for ever.
Description: Moderately variable with most coefficients of variation ≤ 15%, especially those
used in the diagnosis.
Size of cultivated specimens in vivo 180–250 × 70–100 µm, usually about 215 × 80 µm, as
calculated from live measurements and the morphometric data in Table 73 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage. Body basically ellipsoid, more or less deformed when studded with food vacuoles,
anterior half contractile by about 10% (Fig. 198a, 199a–f). Macronuclear nodules in central
quarters in or near midline of cell, widely separate; ellipsoid, rarely broadly ellipsoid both in
vivo and in protargol preparations; with distinct nucleoli. Micronuclei attached to various sites of
macronucleus, about 3 µm across (Fig. 198a, d, 199g, i, j; Table 73). Contractile vacuole slightly

a Distance between centre of paroral membrane and right margin of adoral zone.
anterior of mid-body (Fig. 198a). Cortex very flexible, without specific granules. Cytoplasm
colourless, usually opaque and dark at low magnification because studded with lipid droplets up
to 5 µm across and up to 40 µm-sized food vacuoles containing bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates,
small and middle-sized ciliates (Paracolpoda steinii, Urosoma karinae), and corroded starch
grains from culture medium (Fig. 198a, 199a–f, j). Glides rather slowly on bottom of culture dish
as well as on and between soil and mud accumulations, showing much flexibility.
Infraciliature as typical for bistichellids (Berger 2008), i. e., composed of a right and a left
marginal cirral row; four frontal and two (rarely three) frontoventral cirral rows; transverse cirri;
and dorsal kineties (Fig. 198a, b, d, 199g–k; Table 73). Frontal row 1 composed of frontal cirrus
1 about 20 µm long in vivo; frontal row 2 composed of frontal cirrus 2 and an average of eight
buccal cirri; frontal row 3 composed of frontal cirrus 3 and an average of five cirri; frontal row
4 composed of an average of eight cirri; frontoventral row 5 extends to near transverse cirri,
composed of an average of 48 cirri; and frontoventral row 6 strongly shortened to an average
of nine cirri usually ending at level of transverse cirri. On average five transverse cirri forming
an oblique row, about 20 µm long in vivo and inserted rather far subterminal, thus only slightly
projecting from body proper. Right marginal cirral row commences about 30 µm subapically and
extends to near rear body end, cirri 15 µm long in vivo. On average a total of 203 cirri. Dorsal
bristles 3 µm long in vivo, in three rows commencing distinctly subapically and extending to
near posterior body end. Caudal cirri absent (Fig. 198d).
Oral apparatus also as typical for bistichellids (Berger 2008). Adoral zone of membranelles
conspicuous because composed of an average of 50 membranelles and lanceolate; begins far
subapically on right body margin, then curves around anterior body end and extends about 33%
of body length. Distal half of zone made of small membranelles (base width < 10 µm, handle of
lance), then bases gradually widen to about 20 µm (lance) and, finally, base width decreases rather
abruptly to 2 µm (lancehead). Cilia of frontal membranelles and lateral membranellar cilia up to
25 µm long. Buccal cavity rather wide and deep, supported by a complex fibre system described
in detail by Foissner et al. (2002). Buccal lip about 7 µm wide, bears strongly curved paroral
membrane with cilia gradually decreasing in length from 10 µm anteriorly to 5 µm posteriorly.
Endoral membrane also distinctly curved, crosses obliquely bottom of buccal cavity, intersects
optically with paroral in mid of buccal cavity. Pharynx comparatively small, extends to mid-body
(Fig. 198a, b, 199d–g, i–k; Table 73).
605

Resting cyst (Fig. 198c, 199l–n; Table 73): When encysting several to many specimens come
together, forming aggregates with individual cysts hold next to each other by their slimy cover.
Cysts spherical to slightly ellipsoid, 33–72 µm in vivo, on average about 40 µm across (Table
73). Cyst wall covered by an up to 5 µm thick very hyaline slime layer; 2.5 to 3 µm thick,
compact, stains purple with methyl green-pyronin. All cysts with a large, non-contracting vacuole.
Cyst contents bipartite; external zone finely granular and 2–5 µm thick; internal zone contains
macronuclear nodules (not fused) and many 2–6 µm-sized globules with granular fine structure,
possibly autophagous vacuoles and/or lipid droplets (Fig. 198c, 199l–n). Possibly very similar to
that of Bistichella encystica insufficiently described by Fan et al. (2014).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only in two samples from closely spaced sites (66, 67).
The large size and the broad shape and the type locality indicate a preference for litter and/or
brackish habitats. Could be cultivated for a while in saline water (50‰) with some squashed
wheat kernels.
Remarks: In the species comparison, we discuss only binucleate taxa with transverse cirri and
without cortical granules. These are Parabistichella namibiensis (cirral rows 5 and 6 vs. only
row 5 extends to transverse cirri), and Parabistichella procera and P. terrestris (~ 2 vs. ~ 5
transverse cirri; cirral rows 5 and 6 extend to or slightly posterior of mid-body vs. row 5 extends
to transverse cirri and row 6 strongly shortened ending at level of transverse cirri). See berger
(2008) for authors and dates of the species mentioned.
Parabistichella bergeri brevisticha nov. subspec. (Fig. 200a–e; Table 73)
Diagnosis: Length:width ratio about 3.6:1 in protargol preparations of environmental specimens.
On average a total of 180 cirri including 5 buccal cirri; 21 bristles in dorsal kinety 1. Adoral zone
composed of an average of 38 membranelles.
Type locality: Highly saline (>50‰) litter and humous soil from the coast of Caracas Bay,
Curacao Island, north coast of Venezuela, 71°W 12°N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 6 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: brevisticha is a composite of the Latin adjective brevis (short) and the Greek noun
stichus (row), referring to the slightly shorter cirral rows compared to P. bergeri bergeri.
Description and Remarks: As mentioned above, P. bergeri brevisticha differs from P. bergeri
bergeri mainly by the lower, non-overlapping number of adoral membranelles (38 vs. 50 on
average). This difference is likely not caused by body length which is quite similar in both
subspecies (Table 73). The other differences mentioned in the diagnosis overlap more or less and
are thus of questionable value.
Body size and shape as well as somatic and oral infraciliature are highly similar in the two
subspecies, especially when cultivated specimens are compared (Table 73). Thus, we do not
606

provide a full description but refer to the figures, the morphometrics, and the following in vivo
observations.
Body shape basically ellipsoid, frequently slightly sigmoid, rarely elongate rectangular with
rounded corners; usually slightly wider in anterior than posterior half; laterally flattened up to
2:1 (Fig. 200a–d; Table 73). Anterior macronuclear nodule close to proximal end of adoral zone.
Micronuclei about 5 µm across. Contractile vacuole not recognizable very likely due to the highly
saline environment. Cortex very flexible, specific cortical granules and cytoplasmic crystals
absent, but 2 µm long rods occur in the buccal wall. Preferably feeds on various colpodids, such as
Cyrtolophosis mucicola, Paracolpoda steinii, and even the large Tillina minima digested in food

vacuoles up to 50 µm across. Frontal cirri about 20 µm long, marginal and transverse cirri about
17 µm, the latter thus only slightly projecting from body proper. Oral apparatus conspicuous;
lanceolate shape of adoral zone of membranelles indistinct; largest bases of adoral membranelles
about 20 µm long (Fig. 200a–d; Table 73).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, a highly saline habitat (>50‰
salinity, pH 8.1). Parabistichella bergeri brevisticha appeared in the non-flooded Petri dish
culture two days after rewetting the air-dried sample.
Cotterillia bromelicola Foissner & stoeCK, 2011 (Fig. 201a–d)
The Costa Rican population matches well the Mexican type. Thus, we provide only some figures.
The species was found in moss and mud from old cacao-trees colonized by many bromeliads.
Thus, it might be a bromeliad ciliate, as the type population.
We deposited two voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Some excellently prepared specimens have been
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

This conspicuous ciliate occurred in sample (18) from Costa Rica, i. e., in the mud of a lithotelma
at the bank of the Rio Corobici, near the Centro Ecologia La Pacifica. Thus, S. terricola is now

known from three sites: Saudi Arabia (type), China (Foissner 2007), and Central America,
indicating wide or even cosmopolitan distribution; however, we did not find it in 100 samples
each from Australia and Central Europe.
The Costa Rican specimens were first similar to those from the type population (Fig. 202h).
However, when abundance increased in the non-flooded Petri dish culture, about 90% of the
specimens gradually narrowed posteriorly for unknown reasons (Fig. 202a–g). The cirral pattern
did not change. Size about 250 × 80 µm in vivo; cortical granules absent; transverse cirri about
25 µm long slightly projecting from body proper; three dorsal kineties and scattered bristles
between the rows; fed mainly on two small ciliates, viz. Drepanomonas revoluta and swarmers
of Pseudovorticella sphagni.
We deposited three voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The specimens illustrated are marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.
Family Gonostomatidae s & l , 1985
Mall ynn
As an example, we include in this chapter most unpublished gonostomatids collected since 1985.
These are 11 new species and four new genera which almost doubles the number of described
Gonostomum and Paragonostomum species (for a review, see berger 2001). Most of the new
species were discovered in Gondwanan regions putting forward the “moderate endemicity
model” discussed by Foissner (2008a) and Foissner et al. (2008b). We have many taxa like
the gonostomatids in our unpublished material, suggesting an enormous number of soil ciliate
species most being undescribed.
In hypotrichs, many cirral and nuclear patterns occur, and the gonostomatids are an example that
all patterns are realized in a single family, for instance the presence/absence of transverse (TC)
and caudal (CC) cirri: with TC and CC (Gonostomum), without TC and CC (Gonostomoides nov.
gen.), with CC but without TC (Paragonostomum), and with TC but without CC (Apogonostomum
nov. gen.). As concerns the nuclear apparatus, three of the four main patterns (2 macronuclear
nodules, 4 nodules, many nodules, monomicrocaryon pattern) have been found. A similar series
is formed by the following genera: Paragonostomoides nov. gen., Metagonostomum nov. gen.,
and Apogonostomum nov. gen. They have either the frontoterminal or the frontoventral cirri
organized in long rows.
Paragonostomoides nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Gonostomatidae with caudal cirri and a long row of frontoterminal cirri.
Type species: Paragonostomum minutum KaMra, KuMra & saPra, 2008.
Etymology: Composite of the generic name Gonostomum and the suffix -oides (similar), meaning
a ciliate similar to Gonostomum. Masculine gender.
Gonostomum is neuter (aesCht 2001, berger 2011). Thus, the type species must read
Paragonostomum minutum. KaMra et al. (2008) used the false feminine ending “minuta”.
610

Species assignable: Monotypic!
Remarks: KaMra et al. (2008) noted that the second right marginal row of Paragonostomum
minutum is a long row of frontoterminal cirri. We agree although this should be substantiated by
ontogenetic evidences. In any case, this feature is a strong apomorphy justifying the classification
into a new genus, Paragonostomoides.
Metagonostomum nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Gonostomatidae with transverse and caudal cirri and a long row of frontoterminal
cirri.
Type species: Trachelochaeta gonostomoida heMberger, 1985.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix meta (next to, among after) and the genus-group
name Gonostomum, referring to the similarity with Gonostomum which also has transverse and
caudal cirri but only a few frontoterminal cirri.
Species assignable: Monotypic! Possibly, Trachelochaeta terrestre, which Berger (2011)
classified into Gonostomum, also belongs to Metagonostomum. But a solid redescription should
be awaited because the original description by aleKPerov (2005) is too weak.
Remarks: As in Paragonostomoides, differing from that genus by possessing transverse cirri.
The type species has been redescribed by KaMra et al. (2008) and KiM and shin (2006).
Apogonostomum nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Tailed Gonostomatidae with transverse cirri and frontoventral cirral pairs extending
in body`s midline to buccal vertex or to near transverse cirri. Caudal cirri absent.
Type species: Apogonostomum pantanalense nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived) and the genus-group name Gonostomum.
Neuter gender.
Remarks: This new type of gonostomatids lacks caudal cirri, likely due to the thin tail. It
resembles Wallackia (without frontoterminal cirri; for modern descriptions, see Foissner et al.
2002) and the new genera → Paragonostomoides and → Metagonostomum whose cirral rows
originate by an increase of the frontoterminal cirri; in both the ventral cirral row is close to the
right marginal row while the two rows of Apogonostomum are in midline of body.
Apogonostomum pantanalense nov. spec. (Fig. 203a–g, 204a–h; Table 74)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 170 × 40 µm. Very elongate ellipsoid with distinct tail. 2 ordinarily
located, elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 3 comparatively large globular micronuclei.
Cortical granules prominent because 6 × 1 µm in vivo, form colourless rows. 3 frontal cirri, 2
frontoterminal cirri, 1 buccal cirrus far subapical of paroral membrane, 2 frontoventral cirral
rows forming an average of 8 cirral pairs, 2 pretransverse cirri in special position and 4 transverse
cirri. Right marginal row composed of an average of 25 cirri, left of 16. Three dorsal kineties with

Type locality: Floodplain soil of the Paraná River near to the town of Maringà, Pantanal, Brazil,
53°15‘W 22°40‘S.
614

Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and relevant paratype specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The adjective pantanalense is a combination of the suffix -ensis and the region the
species was discovered, i. e., the Pantanal, a famous wetland in Brazil.
Description: Size in vivo 130–215 × 35–70 µm, usually about 170 × 40 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 74 adding 20% and 15% for length
and width shrinkage of especially the tail. Body basically ellipsoid, posterior region, however,
tail-like elongated and anterior end slightly beak-shaped due to the more or less narrowed and
concave oral area; laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 203a–c, 204a, f; Table 74). Nuclear apparatus
composed of two macronuclear nodules and two to six micronuclei (Fig. 203a, d, 204f–h;
Table 74). Macronuclear nodules in usual pattern, i. e., a nodule each in anterior quarter of cell
and slightly posterior of proximal region of adoral zone of membranelles; nodules ellipsoid to
elongate ellipsoid, with many minute nucleoli. Micronuclei near and attached to macronuclear
nodules, conspicuous in vivo because about 6 × 5 µm in size and highly refractive, globular to
broadly ellipsoid. Contractile vacuole posterior of proximal region of adoral zone, moderately
distant from left body margin (Fig. 203a). Cortex flexible, with rows of colourless extrusomes
(cortical granules) 5–7 × 1–2 µm in size and thus forming a conspicuous fringe in vivo and in
preparations, produce a spotted surface, stain with methyl green-pyronin and often impregnate
deeply with the protargol method used (Fig. 203a, e, f, 204b–e, g); become extruded and nail-
shaped when cell is slightly pressed, then elongate to long filaments producing a dense envelope
(further details, see Figures cited above and Figure explanations). Cytoplasm colourless, usually
distinctly vacuolated, contains some ordinary crystals (Fig. 203g) and many 3–10 µm-sized food
vacuoles with bacteria, fungal spores, and heterotrophic flagellates (Fig. 203a, 204a). Creeps
slowly on microscope slides and swims clumsily.
Cirri not in typical Gonostomum pattern shown by berger (1999, 2011) and Foissner et al. (2001)
because frontoventral cirri greatly increased in number, forming two rows extending in cell`s
midline from near anterior body end to transverse cirri (Fig. 203a, c, 204f, h); rows rather widely
spaced, form an average of eight strongly oblique cirral pairs. Three distinctly enlarged frontal
cirri about 20 µm long in vivo, and one cirrus (“fourth frontal cirrus”) from anlage III; two
frontoterminal cirri in anterior quarter of cell and right of frontoventral cirral rows; one buccal
cirrus far subapical of paroral membrane. Usually four or five thin transverse cirri far subterminal
at base of tail and thus not projecting from body proper; in ordinary pattern and about 20 µm
long in vivo. Pretransverse cirri in unusual position, viz., side by side opposite to transverse cirri.
Marginal cirri about 17 µm long in vivo, intracirral distances slightly increasing from anterior
to posterior; right row begins subapically and ends subterminally one or two cirri anterior of left
marginal row (Fig. 203a, c, 204f, h).
Three dorsal kineties with cilia 3–4 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations; rows bipolar,
that in midline ending subterminally near base of tail; kinetids narrowly spaced, especially in row
1. Caudal cirri definitely absent in holotype and some marked paratype specimens, while right
and left row extend to tip of tail (Fig. 203d, 204a, f, h; Table 74).
615

Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 1999, 2011), i. e., adoral zone slightly sigmoid
and following left body margin before bending rather abruptly inwards at about 57% of body
length, on average composed of 53 ordinary membranelles with largest bases only 5 µm long
in vivo (Fig. 203a, c, 204a, f, h; Table 74). Buccal cavity flat and small compared to body size;
buccal lip distinctly convex, bears slightly oblique paroral membrane composed of an average of
19 kinetids with cilia about 8 µm long in vivo. Endoral membrane extends on dorsal margin of
buccal cavity, cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, anteriorly distinctly shorter than paroral membrane
while distinctly longer posteriorly extending to last adoral membranelle; undulating membrane
pattern depending on preparation quality and angle viewed, i.e., the paroral may be partially or
entirely right or left of the endoral. Pharyngeal fibres extend almost transversely to body`s main
axis, originate from endoral membrane and last adoral membranelles.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, viz., the floodplain of the Aurelio
Lagoon associated with the Baia River which is a tributary of the large Paraná River. The dark,
humic soil was mixed with much partially decomposed leave litter and had pH 5.1 in water
(sample kindly provided by Dr. Felipe Machado Velho, Maringá State University, Brazil). In the
non-flooded Petri dish culture, A. pantanalense appeared 10 days after rewetting. Considering
the habitat, we cannot exclude that A. pantanalense is a limnetic mud-dweller.
Remarks: Apogonostomum pantanalense has a clear identity. There are only two species which
have a notable overall similarity, viz., Gonostomum namibiense Foissner et al., 2002 (only 90 ×
20 µm vs. 170 × 40 µm; frontoventral cirri do not extend postorally vs. extending to transverse
cirri) and Apogonostomum vleiacola (frontoventral ciliature does not extend postorally vs.
extending to transverse cirri; tail 1/ vs. 1/ of body length).

Apogonostomum vleiacola nov. spec. (Fig. 205a–i, 206a–k; Table 75)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 130 × 25 µm. Body knife-shaped with tail counting for about one
third of body length. 2 ordinarily located, ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 2 micronuclei.

cirri at base of tail, i. e., far subterminal. Right marginal row composed of an average of 27 cirri,
left of 15. 3 dorsal kineties, distal end of bristles deeply impregnated with protargol. Adoral zone
of membranelles extends 41% of body length, composed of an average of 29 membranelles;
buccal lip convex, covers proximal membranelles. Paroral and endoral membrane side by side,
distinctly staggered, paroral membrane composed of an average of 16 kinetids with 10 µm long
cilia.

Republic of South Africa, 33°53’S 18°25’E.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and important paratype specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

15%, in the main characteristics even lower than 10%. Accordingly, similar but distinct species
of this group should be easily recognizable. Only specimens with well preserved tail were used
for the morphological and morphometric analyses.
Size in vivo 100–160 × 20–30 µm, on average about 130 × 25 µm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 75 adding 25% length shrinkage (due
to general fragility of the species, especially of the tail) and 15% width shrinkage. Body elegant
because slender and with long tail; roughly knife-shaped or elongate claviform, oblong without
tail; length:width ratio 3.7–5.8:1 in protargol preparations, up to 7:1 in vivo; anterior end slightly
projecting ventrally; tail elongate cuneate, distal end 1.5–2.5 µm wide in vivo (Fig. 205a–d, f–h,
206a–c; Table 75). Nuclear apparatus in central quarters of cell, composed of two ellipsoid or
elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules with many minute nucleoli and two to three globular
or ellipsoid micronuclei often attached to anterior end of macronuclear nodules (Fig. 205a, c, f,
206a–d, g, h; Table 75). Contractile vacuole at proximal end of adoral zone (Fig. 205a, f). Tail
and cortex fragile, studded with rows of colourless granules in vivo about 2.5 × 0.8 µm in size;
granules in vivo difficult to recognize and to separate from mitochondria because pale and hidden
by the opaque cytoplasm; stain blue and partially extruded when methyl green-pyronin is applied
becoming about 3 µm long and cuneate with a deeply stained dot in distal end; in protargol
preparations up to 6 µm long, indicating that they can elongate to long threads like those of →
A. pantanalensis (Fig. 205a, e, 206e). Cytoplasm opaque due to countless granules, colourless.
Feeds on bacteria and small heterotrophic flagellates digested in vacuoles up to 8 µm across.
Glides versatily on microscope slides and between soil particles; performs a kind of jumps using
the tail as flicking support (Fig. 205f–h).
Somatic ciliature dominated by four, rarely five pairs of frontoventral cirri in body`s midline,
last cirrus at level of buccal vertex, cirri about 12 µm long in vivo (Fig. 205a, b, d, 206b, c, d, g;
Table 75). Three slightly thickened frontal cirri about 15 µm long in vivo; two frontoterminal cirri
right of first pair of frontoventral cirri, usually distinctly separate from each other and from distal
end of adoral zone; one buccal cirrus subapical of paroral membrane, about 15 µm long in vivo.
Transverse cirri on average 40% distant from posterior body end, i. e., at base of tail; two minute
pretransverse cirri in Gonostomum pattern, i. e., side by side in cavity formed by transverse
cirri; five to six transverse cirri, some slightly thickened, in -like pattern, about 15 µm long in
vivo. Marginal cirri composed of two ciliary rows with three cilia each, cirri in distal third of tail
composed of only four cilia, rarely of only two, all about 12 µm long in vivo. Right marginal row
commences about 10% posterior of anterior body end, first cirrus occasionally set off by a slightly
increased intracirral distance (Fig. 205d), ends subterminally, composed of an average of 27 cirri
contrasting the 15 cirri composing the left row extending to or near to tip of tail (Fig. 205a, b, d,
206b, c, d, g; Table 75).
Dorsal bristles in three rows, 4–5 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations, distal end with
increased protargol affinity (Fig. 205a, c, d, i, 206f, h–k; Table 75). Rows 1 and 3 bipolar, row 2
ends near base of tail; on tip of tail an ordinary, 4–5 µm long bristle and a second about 12 µm
long bristle or a marginal cirrus made of only one cilium seen three times in vivo and two times
in protargol preparations (Fig. 205a, 206f). Caudal cirri absent.
Oral apparatus gonostomoid (berger 2011), i. e., the adoral zone follows the anterior and left body
621

margin and bends abruptly into the cell at about 41% of body length. Adoral zone flat to slightly
sigmoid, on average composed of 29 gonostomoid membranelles with largest bases about 3.5
µm long, intramembranellar distances distinctly increase from proximal to distal, a rare feature
present also in → Gonostomum lajacola; four frontal membranelles with about 20 µm long cilia
(Fig. 205a, b, d, f–h, 206a–d, g; Table 75). Buccal cavity flat and moderately wide; buccal lip
convex, covers some proximal membranelles. Paroral membrane near left margin of buccal lip
and thus slightly convex, composed of an average of 16 kinetids with cilia about 10 µm long in
vivo and in protargol preparations. Endoral membrane commences at level of posterior half of
paroral, straight, kinetids narrower spaced anteriorly than posteriorly. Pharyngeal fibres extend
at right angles to right margin of cell (Fig. 205a, b, d, f–h, 206a–d, g; Table 75).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality which is a semiterrestrial habitat.
Thus, we cannot know the preferred environment but the slender body indicates soil (Foissner
1987b).
Remarks: Apogonostomum vleiacola differs from → A. pantanalensis mainly by the ventral
cirral pairs (extending to buccal vertex vs. to transverse cirri), the length of the adoral zone
(41% vs. 57% of body length), and the number (29 vs. 51) of adoral membranelles. In vivo,
Paragonostomum caudatum Foissner et al. 2002 resembles A. vleiacola because it has a very
similar body shape. They can be distinguished by body size (85 × 20 µm vs. 130 × 25 µm in
vivo), the cortical granules (absent vs. present), and the number of transverse cirri (absent vs.
five to six).
Paragonostomum australiense nov. spec. (Fig. 207a–g, 208a–f, 209a–t; Table 76)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 80 × 25 µm; lenticular with acute posterior region. 2 ellipsoid
macronuclear nodules and 2 micronuclei. Cortical granules scattered, colourless, 1–1.5 × 0.5–0.8
µm in size. 3 frontal cirri, 4 frontoterminal cirri on average; 1 buccal cirrus slightly subapical
of paroral membrane; 3 dorsal kineties and caudal cirri. Adoral zone flat, extends about 45% of
body length, consists of an average of 23 membranelles. On average 12 paroral kinetids with
cilia 10–12 µm long in vivo.
Type locality: Litter and soil from crevices of a small mountain in the Macdonnell Ranges
slightly south of the town of Alice Springs, Australia, 134°E 23°30’S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides as well as 6 voucher slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have been marked by black
ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the continent found, viz., Australia.
Description: We studied two populations from Australia in vivo and in protargol preparations.
Although being separated by a distance of about 1.500 km, they are highly similar and thus are
described together.

Most features of P. australiense have an ordinary variability (CV ≤ 15%; Table 76). The type
population is more variable than the voucher specimens. Of the characteristics used in the
diagnosis, the number of micronuclei (1–5, CV ~ 32%) and frontoterminal cirri (2–5, CV ~ 16%)
have coefficients of variation > 15%.
Size in vivo 65–100 × 20–35 µm, usually about 80 × 25 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 76 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
ordinarily to elongate lenticular or pisciform, i. e., both ends distinctly narrowed, posterior end
bluntly acute, right margin usually more convex than left; laterally flattened up to 2:1 and slightly
concave ventrally (Fig. 207a, b, d, e, g, 208a–c; Table 76). Nuclear apparatus in central quarters
left of body´s midline. Macronuclear nodules rather close, viz., slightly anterior and posterior of
proximal end of adoral zone of membranelles; anterior nodule in or slightly left of body´s midline,
posterior left of midline; ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid, with many small nucleoli. Usually two
micronuclei attached to right or left side of macronuclear nodules, in type population distinctly
smaller than in the second one (Fig. 207a, c, 208a–c; Table 76). Contractile vacuole very near to
proximal end of adoral zone of membranelles and rather far away from left body margin, with

two collecting canals extending to body ends (Fig. 207a, e). Cortex very flexible, contains rather
refractive, colourless, scattered granules 1–1.5 × 0.5–0.8 µm in size and staining red with methyl
green-pyronin (Fig. 207e, f). Cytoplasm colourless, contains food vacuoles 5–10 µm across and,
mainly in posterior third, lipid droplets 1–3 µm in size. Feeds on bacteria, naked amoebae with
ingested fungal spores, small ciliates (Protocyclidium terricola) and flagellates (Polytoma), and
cysts of amoebae or flagellates (Fig. 207a). Glides moderately rapid on microscope slides.
630

Cirri of ordinary length and thickness, arranged like in → G. strenuum, i. e., with comparatively
long frontoterminal row and long, slightly oblique anlage V, each composed of three to five
cirri (Fig. 207a, b, d, 208a–c; Table 76). Three frontal cirri about 15 µm long in vivo, cirrus 1
distinctly enlarged; second cirrus of anlage III (“fourth frontal cirrus”) slightly enlarged; buccal
cirrus slightly subapical of paroral membrane; transverse cirri absent. Marginal cirri 8–10 µm
long in vivo and in protargol preparations, very likely composed of two rows with three cilia each
in anterior thirds of rows while of two rows with two cilia each in posterior third; right marginal
row commences subapically and both rows extend to near posterior body end (Fig. 207a, b,
208a–c; Table 76).
Dorsal bristle pattern without peculiarities, bristles about 3 µm long in vivo and in protargol
preparations. Caudal cirri near posterior body end, about 12 µm long in vivo (Fig. 207a, c, 208b,
c, e, f; Table 76).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 2011), i. e., the adoral zone follows anterior and
left body margin where it bends abruptly inwards at about 45% of body length (Fig. 207a, b, d,
208a–c; Table 76). Adoral zone flat, on average composed of 23 gonostomoid membranelles
with largest bases about 4 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations. Buccal cavity narrow,
covered by a convex lip bearing paroral membrane composed of an average of 12 kinetids with
cilia 10–12 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations. Endoral membrane commences in mid
of paroral membrane, slightly convex. Pharyngeal fibres extend slightly obliquely to right body
margin.
Ontogenesis (Fig. 209a–t): This is highly similar to those of Gonostomum affine, G. kuehnelti,
and G. algicola (reviewed in berger 2011), except for the absence of transverse cirri which
develop from anlagen V and VI or only from VI in Gonostomum spp. In our opinion it is still
questionable whether anlage VI originates de novo or from migrating basal bodies of the oral
primordium or the neighbouring anlagen.
We do not provide a detailed description of the ontogenesis of Paragonostomum australiense
because it is so similar to that of Gonostomum spp. However, we provide detailed figures and
figure explanations so that a comparison with other gonostomatids becomes possible.
Occurrence and ecology: Found not only in central Australia but also about 1.500 km east, i. e.,
in a litter and soil sample from the bushland between Mount Molley and the town of Mareeba,
45°25’ E 17°S. This indicates wide distribution in Australia.
Remarks: Several congeners resemble P. australiense, but only one has cortical granules, viz.,
P. simplex, a species as yet recorded only from Austria. Further, P. simplex has a rather broadly
rounded posterior end and a C-shaped macronuclear figure composed of an average of 10 nodules.
Paragonostomum caudatum has a real tail (vs. acute end); P. rarisetum has also a distinct tail
(vs. acute end) and a specific pattern of the frontoventral and frontoterminal cirri (vs. ordinary
pattern); and P. binucleatum has only about 9 (vs. ~ 15) frontal and frontoventral cirri. Further,
its paroral membrane is bipartite (vs. uninterrupted). See berger (2011) for a review of all taxa
mentioned.
631

Gonostomoides nov. gen.
Diagnosis: As Gonostomum and Paragonostomum but without transverse and caudal cirri.
Type species: Gonostomoides galapagensis nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the generic name Gonostomum and the Greek suffix oides (similar),
meaning a ciliate similar to Gonostomum. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Gonostomatids are very common in soils globally (Foissner 1998). Gonostomum, which
occurs also in limnetic habitats, has an ordinary cirral pattern, i. e., there are frontal, frontoventral,
buccal, marginal, transverse, and caudal cirri (berger 1999). The genus Paragonostomum, which
was established by Foissner et al. (2002), lacks transverse cirri, and Gonostomoides lacks both,
transverse and caudal cirri. Today, this is considered as significant at generic level (berger 2006,
2008, 2011). It is remarkable that we found four species in the neotropis while none in the other
large biogeographic regions, suggesting a restricted distribution.
Gonostomoides galapagensis nov. spec. (Fig. 210a–i, 211a–g; Table 77)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 75 × 25 µm; ellipsoid to slenderly obovate. On average 6 globular to
ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 2 globular to broadly ellipsoid micronuclei. Cortical granules
dispersed, refractive, colourless, about 1 × 0.5 µm. On average 3 frontal cirri, 6 frontoventral
cirri, 1 buccal cirrus far anteriorly of undulating membranes, 18 cirri in right marginal row and
12 in left. 3 dorsal kineties. Adoral zone extends an average of 43% of body length, composed of
about 20 membranelles. Buccal cavity narrow and flat. Paroral membrane composed of 4 kinetids
on average.
Type locality: Surface soil under a tree with many epiphytic orchids in the Sierra Negra Crater
near the volcano “Chico”, 1050 m above sea level, Isabela Island, Galápagos, 0°57‘S 90°57‘W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the archipelago where it was discovered, i. e., the Galápagos Islands.
Description: Size in vivo 60–90 × 20–30 µm, usually about 75 × 25 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 77 adding 20% length and 10%
width shrinkage due to insufficient fixation. Body in vivo slenderly obovate to slenderly ellipsoid,
usually widest in anterior quarter due to a more or less pronounced convexity along right margin
of cell (Fig. 210a–c, 211a, c); most prepared specimens ellipsoid to narrowly ellipsoid due to
insufficient fixation (Fig. 210g–i, 211b, d, e); dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1. Four to nine, on
average six macronuclear nodules, forming a conspicuous strand in body´s midline; individual
nodules globular to narrowly ellipsoid, usually ellipsoid, not connected; nucleoli inconspicuous.

On average two globular to broadly ellipsoid micronuclei attached to macronuclear strand at
various sites (Fig. 210a, d, h, i, 211a–e, g; Table 77). Contractile vacuole in mid-body posterior
to buccal vertex, with short, lacunar collecting canals. Cortex very flexible. Cortical granules
inconspicuous because colourless, rather dispersed, and only 0.7–1 × 0.4–0.6 µm in size;
moderately compact and bright (Fig. 210e, f). Cytoplasm turbid due to countless, minute organic
granules, colourless, posterior region usually studded with lipid droplets 1–2 µm across. Feeds
on bacteria and possibly also on humic material digested in vacuoles 4–6 µm across (Fig. 210a).
Glides rather rapidly on microscope slides and soil particles.
Cirral pattern gonostomoid (for a review, see berger 1999) but without transverse and caudal
cirri checked in 50 specimens (Fig. 210a, c, d, g, h, 211a–e; Table 77). Frontal cirri in convex
row, about 13 µm long in vivo, first frontal cirrus distinctly enlarged. Buccal cirrus far anterior of
undulating membranes, 14 µm long in vivo; frontoventral cirri of various size and arrangement,
restricted to anterior fifth of cell on average. Marginal cirri thick, about 12 µm long in vivo, rows
widely open posteriorly.
Dorsal bristles about 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in three kineties, i. e., a row each along body
margin and one in body midline; the latter frequently irregularly curved, possibly due to the
636

macronuclear strands and/or food vacuoles; number of bristles highly variable, e. g., coefficient
of variation 29% in row 1 (Fig. 210h, l, 211c; Table 77).
Adoral zone extends 43% of body length on average, with typical Gonostomum shape (for a
review, see berger 1999), composed of an average of 20 membranelles having ciliary row 3
distinctly shortened, largest membranellar base about 4 µm long in protargol preparations, cilia
up to 10 µm long in vivo (Fig. 210a–c, g, 211a, b, d, f, g; Table 77). Buccal cavity flat and narrow;
buccal lip broadly convex covering proximal third of adoral zone. Undulating membranes side by
side, straight, endoral composed of about 20 basal bodies with 5 µm long cilia; paroral composed
of an average of four kinetids, of which one or two may lack the cilium, cilia highly mobile and
about 10 µm long in vivo, distal half very fine and thus difficult to recognize (Fig. 210a–c, 211a,
b, d, g; Table 77). Pharyngeal fibres distinct both in vivo and in protargol preparations, extend
obliquely backwards (Fig. 210a–c, g, 211a).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, became rather abundant in the non-
flooded Petri dish culture two days after rewetting the sample, indicating a r-selected live strategy.
Remarks: Size and shape of Gonostomoides galapagensis highly resemble a small Gonostomum
affine, one of the most common soil ciliates (Foissner et al. 2002). However, it is easily
distinguished from Gonostomum spp., except of G. kuehnelti, by the moniliform macronucleus
(vs. two nodules). Gonostomum kuehnelti has four macronuclear nodules (vs. six) and four (vs.
absent) distinct transverse cirri. In the Galápagos preparations, G. galapagensis is easily confused
with a Gonostomum affine population having only one transverse cirrus, just as the Saudi Arabian
specimens studied by Foissner et al. (2001).
Another very similar species is Paragonostomum simplex, differing from G. galapagensis mainly
by the presence (vs. absence) of caudal cirri and the average number of cilia (eight vs. four)
comprising the paroral membrane (Foissner et al. 2005a).
Gonostomoides bimacronucleatus nov. spec. (Fig. 212a–d, 213a–g; Table 77)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 90 × 30 µm; slenderly ellipsoid to ellipsoid. 2 ovate to slenderly ovate
macronuclear nodules with narrowed ends opposed. On average 3 frontal cirri, 7 frontoventral
cirri, 1 buccal cirrus at level of anterior end of paroral membrane, 23 cirri in right marginal row
and 16 in left. 3 dorsal kineties. Adoral zone extends an average of 39% of body length, composed
of about 21 membranelles. Buccal cavity narrow and flat. Paroral membrane composed of 6
kinetids on average.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (57), i. e., moss on stones and soil from a small cave in the Golfete
de Cuare del Indio, 67°13’W 11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens
have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
637

Etymology: The species name is a composite of the numeral bi (two), the Greek adjective macros
(large), and the Latin adjective nucleatus (with a nucleus), referring to the two macronuclear
nodules (in contrast to G. galapagensis which has eight).
Description and Remarks: Gonostomoides bimacronucleatus is in vivo highly similar to several
Gonostomum and Paragonostomum species, especially to the very common G. affine, except, of
course, for the lack of transverse and caudal cirri. From → G. fraterculus, the sole congener with
two macronuclear nodules, G. bimacronucleatus differs by body size (90 × 30 µm vs. 70 × 25
µm), the arrangement of the macronuclear nodules (close together vs. clearly distant), the number
of frontoventral cirri (7 vs. 10 in specific pattern), the number of adoral membranelles (26 vs. 21),
and the number of paroral kinetids (6 vs. 11, almost non-overlapping). Obviously, G. fraterculum
and G. bimacronucleatus are rather similar. Very likely, the best separation is achieved by the
frontoventral cirral pattern and the number of paroral kinetids.

Thus, we do not provide an ordinary description, which would be a repetition of that of → G.
galapagensis, but refer the reader to the diagnosis, the detailed morphometric analysis, the figures,
and the figure explanations (Fig. 212a–d, 213a–g; Table 77). As concerns Gonostomum affine, a
highly variable species (berger 1999, Foissner et al. 2001), the numbers of adoral membranelles
(21 vs. ≥ 25) and paroral kinetids (6 vs. 11 on average) are lower in G. bimacronucleatus.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at the slightly saline (~ 10‰) type locality. In the
non-flooded Petri dish culture, G. bimacronucleatus became numerous six days after rewetting
the sample.
Gonostomoides caudatus nov. spec. (Fig. 214a–e, 215a–d; Table 78)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 85 × 20 µm; pisciform and slightly sigmoid. Usually 4 ellipsoid
macronuclear nodules and 2 micronuclei in anterior thirds of body. On average 3 frontal cirri,
1 buccal cirrus at level of anterior end of paroral membrane, 9 frontoventral cirri including 4
frontoterminal cirri, 30 cirri in right marginal row and 22 in left. 3 dorsal kineties. Adoral zone
extends an average of 27% of body length, composed of about 16 membranelles. Buccal cavity
very narrow and flat. Paroral membrane composed of 6 kinetids on average.
Type locality: Soil from the Isla Robinson Crusoe, Archipelago Juan Fernandez, Chile 33°S
78°W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin participle caudatus refers to the tail-like posterior body end, a main feature
of this species.
Description: This species is very fragile. Thus live observation was difficult and the tail usually
incompletely maintained in the protargol preparations.
Size in vivo 70–115 × 15–25 µm, on average about 85 × 20 µm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 78 adding 15% width and 25% length
shrinkage due to insufficient tail preservation and general preparation shrinkage. Body in vivo
pisciform and slightly sigmoid, laterally flattened up to 2:1, right margin more convex than left,
length and distinctness of tail highly variable (Fig. 214a–d, 215b); in protargol preparations often
elongate lenticular due to shrinkage or inflation of tail (Fig. 214d, 215a). Four to six, on average
four ellipsoid macronuclear nodules in anterior thirds of body and left of its midline; nucleoli of
ordinary number and size. One to four, on average two broadly ellipsoid micronuclei attached
to various sites of macronuclear nodules (Fig. 214a, e, 215a, b). Contractile vacuole not found,
possibly lacking. Cortex highly flexible, very likely without specific granules. Cytoplasm clear
and colourless, contains some lipid droplets and barrel-shaped crystals concentrated in base of tail,
both 2–4 µm in size; with some 2–3 µm long, deeply impregnating, lenticular inclusions (cortical
granules?). Feeds on deeply impregnating bacteria digested in about 7 µm-sized vacuoles. Glides

slowly on microscope slide and soil particles, showing much flexibility (Fig. 214a, 215a–c).
Cirri fine and about 8 µm long in vivo, except of thickened and 10 µm long frontal cirri, arranged
in gonostomoid pattern (berger 1999, 2011) but without transverse and caudal cirri (Fig. 214a,
d, e, 215a–c; Table 78). Frontal cirri in strongly convex pattern, first slightly enlarged, second
thinner than first and third. Buccal cirrus at level of anterior end and distinctly right of paroral
membrane. Four frontoterminal cirri in a row near right body margin, other frontoventral cirri
in one or two rough rows right of and in body midline. Marginal cirri comparatively numerous,
intracirral distances greatly increase in tail area (Fig. 214a, d, 215a–d; Table 78).
Three almost bipolar dorsal kineties with bristles 3–4 µm long in vivo and 2–3 µm in protargol
preparations; on average nine bristles in row 2 (Fig. 214e; Table 78).

642

Adoral zone extends 27% of body length on average, with typical Gonostomum shape (for a
review, see berger 1999), composed of an average of 20 membranelles with about 10 µm long
cilia (Fig. 214a, d, 215a, b; Table 78). Buccal cavity very flat and narrow both in vivo and in
protargol preparations; buccal lip inconspicuous, slightly convex, covers proximal region of
adoral zone. Endoral and paroral membrane short, the latter comprising only six cilia on average.
Pharyngeal fibres short, extend obliquely backwards (Fig. 214a, d, 215a, b; Table 78).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in soil of a very dry steppe
grown with wild barley near the airport of the Juan Fernandez archipelago; pH 6.5 in water.
Remarks: Gonostomoides caudatus is easily distinguished from the congeners by the pisciform
shape which, however, makes it similar to a variety of genera described inter alia by Foissner
(1982) and Foissner et al. (2002), such as Urosomoida, Erimophrya, Gonostomum and,
especially, Paragonostomum spp. which also lack transverse cirri but have caudal cirri. The most

Gonostomoides fraterculus nov. spec. (Fig. 216a–g; Table 78)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 70 × 25 µm; slenderly ellipsoid. 2 ellipsoid to ovate macronuclear
nodules and an average of 2 broadly ellipsoid micronuclei. On average 3 frontal cirri, 10
frontoventral cirri, 1 buccal cirrus slightly anterior of paroral membrane, 23 cirri in right marginal
row and 17 in left. 3 dorsal kineties. Adoral zone extends an average of 44% of body length,
composed of about 26 membranelles. Buccal cavity narrow and flat. Paroral membrane composed
of 11 kinetids on average.
Type locality: Soil under a Pandanus palm in the garden of the hotel San Fernando, Puerto
644

Ayora, Santa Cruz Island, Galápagos, 0°37’S 90°21’W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 5 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin species name is a composite of the noun frater (brother) and the diminutive
culus (similar, small), referring to → G. galapagensis, a congener from Galápagos, and to the
similarity with → G. bimacronucleatus.
Description: Size in vivo 60–80 × 20–35 µm, usually about 70 × 25 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 78 adding 20% length and
15% width shrinkage due to ethanol fixation. Body slenderly ellipsoid with anterior end usually
narrower than posterior (Fig. 216a, d, f, g); dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1. Nuclear apparatus
in Gonostomum pattern, i. e., macronuclear nodules slightly left of body`s midline and separated
by an about 12 µm wide distance. Individual nodules broadly to slenderly ellipsoid or ovate,
on average 11 × 6 µm in protargol preparations. Two to four, on average two broadly ellipsoid
micronuclei attached to various sites of macronuclear nodules (Fig. 216a, b, e, g; Table 78).
Contractile vacuole in mid-body posterior of buccal vertex, with short collecting canals. Cortex
very flexible, possibly with colourless, inconspicuous granules. Cytoplasm not studied in detail.
Feeds on bacteria, small heterotrophic flagellates, and fungal spores digested in vacuoles 4–7 µm
across (Fig. 216a). Glides rather rapidly on microscope slides and soil particles.
Cirri about 10 µm long in vivo, except of 15 µm long frontal cirri. Frontal cirrus 1 slightly
enlarged. Buccal cirrus at or slightly anterior of distal end of paroral membrane. Frontoventral
cirri in characteristic pattern: three frontoterminal cirri posterior of rightmost frontal cirrus; left
and slightly posterior of frontoterminal cirri three cirri; and an oblique row composed of three
to five, usually four cirri posterior of frontoventral row. Absence of transverse and caudal cirri
checked in over 30 specimens and in a late divider (Fig. 216a, c, d, e, f; Table 78).
Dorsal bristles about 3 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations, arranged in three rows, i.
e., a kinety each along body margin and one in midline of body (Fig. 216b, e).
Adoral zone extends 44% of body length on average, with typical Gonostomum shape in
specimens fixed with Stieve`s solution while ethanol fixed cells become rather inflated making
zone more or less convex. On average 26 adoral membranelles having row 3 distinctly shortened,
cilia of frontal membranelles about 15 µm long, those in ventral region 10 µm (Fig. 216a, d, f, g;
Table 78). Buccal cavity flat and moderately narrow; buccal lip slightly convex covering some
proximal membranelles. Undulating membranes side by side, slightly curved, endoral membrane
about 2.5 times longer than paroral composed of an average of 11 kinetids with about 8 µm long
cilia. Pharyngeal fibres distinct, extend obliquely to right body margin (Fig. 216a, d; Table 78).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality.
Remarks: For comparison with related species, see → G. bimacronucleatus. Easily confused
with Gonostomum affine (with transverse and caudal cirri)!

Gonostomum strenuum (engelMann, 1862) sterKi, 1878 (Fig. 217a–e, 218a–g;
Tables 79, 80)
Material: We investigated a population each from the Dominican Republic (grassland soil from
the airport area of Puerto Plata, pH 6.6) and Tanzania, Africa (dark brown to black soil and some
litter from the margin of the Ngarongora crater, 3°10’S 35°34’E; sample kindly provided by Mr.
Emmerich Petz). Two and four voucher slides from the Dominican and Tanzanian population,
respectively, have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz
(LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Remarks: Gonostomum strenuum has been reviewed and neotypified by berger (1999) and
Foissner et al. (2002). Thus, we restrict the description of the two new populations to some
figures, a detailed morphometry (Tables 79, 80), and the most important features. The Dominican
population has small body size and, like the Spanish specimens, one or two supernumerary
cirri between frontoventral cirral row V and the pretransverse/transverse cirri. The Tanzanian
specimens are almost as slender as the type specimen (Fig. 217a, c, 218f). They have more adoral
membranelles and micronuclei but less cirri in frontoventral row V, which thus does not extend
beyond the buccal vertex (Table 80).
The addition of two populations to the three known ones slightly increases the range of most
features (Table 80). This is not unexpected and hardly can be used to split G. strenuum into
subspecies. Now, molecular data are needed.
Notes on a Dominican population (Fig. 217e, 218a–e; Tables 79, 80): Size in vivo about 100
× 30 µm. Shape indistinguishable from that of G. affine. Two to four, usually three micronuclei.
Contractile vacuole slightly posterior of buccal vertex, with lacunar collecting canals. Cortical
granules in narrow rows forming a rather distinct fringe, colourless, in vivo about 1.5 × 1 µm in
size, stain red with methyl green-pyronin. Cytoplasm with 4–7 µm-sized food vacuoles containing
bacteria; posterior third crammed with barrel-shaped, about 3 µm long, bright inclusions
(crystals?).
Frontal cirri in vivo 15 µm long, transverse cirri about 20 µm, marginal cirri 15 µm long and likely
composed of three ciliary rows. On average 26 right marginal cirri and 19 left, 3 frontal cirri, 5
frontoterminal cirri, 13 frontoventral cirri, 1 buccal cirrus, and 4 pretransverse and transverse
cirri; frontoventral row V composed of an average of seven cirri, slightly to distinctly surpasses
buccal vertex; one or two supernumerary cirri between frontoventral row V and pretransverse/
transverse cirri in 67% of specimens (34% with one cirrus, 33% with two cirri), either side by side
or one after the other (Fig. 217e, 218a, b; Table 79). Dorsal bristles 4 µm long in vivo, arranged
in three rows.
Adoral zone extends 46% of body length, composed of 29 membranelles on average; 12 paroral
cilia on a convexity of buccal lip.
Notes on a Tanzanian population (Fig. 217a, b, d, 218f, g; Tables 79, 80): Size in vivo about
120 × 30 µm, i. e., elongate ellipsoid. Shape indistinguishable from that of G. affine. Five to eight,
on average six ellipsoid micronuclei. Contractile vacuole slightly posterior of buccal vertex and
647

slightly left of body’s midline, with two collecting canals. Cortical granules as in Dominican
specimens. Cytoplasm with 4–7 µm-sized food vacuoles containing bacteria; posterior third
studded with knotty, bright inclusions (crystals?).
Frontal cirri in vivo about 18 µm long, marginal cirri about 12 µm, transverse cirri about 20 µm;
caudal cirri beat vividly, about 20 µm long. On average 27 right marginal cirri and 19 left, 3
frontal cirri, 4 frontoterminal cirri, 11 frontoventral cirri, 1 buccal cirrus, and 4 pretransverse and
transverse cirri; frontoventral row V composed of an average of six cirri, does not surpass buccal
vertex. Dorsal bristles 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in three rows (Fig. 217a, d, e, 218a, b, d, e–g;

Adoral zone extends 48% of body length, composed of 34 membranelles on average; 16 paroral
cilia on a convexity of buccal lip (Fig. 217a, e, 218a, b, e–g; Tables 79, 80).
Gonostomum halophilum nov. spec. (Fig. 219a–e, 220a–e; Table 81)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 80 × 30 µm; ellipsoid to elongate rectangular. 2 macronuclear
nodules and 2 micronuclei. Cortical granules scattered, colourless, about 0.8 µm across. 3 frontal
cirri; 4–5 frontoterminal cirri; 1 buccal cirrus far anterior of paroral membrane; 2 transverse
cirri near posterior body end. 3 dorsal kineties and caudal cirri. Right marginal row composed
of an average of 28 cirri, left of 20. Adoral zone flat, extends about 40% of body length, consists
of an average of 26 membranelles. On average 2 paroral kinetids near anterior end of endoral
membrane.
Type locality: Highly saline soil from a mangrove swamp in the outskirts of the town of Cairns,
Australia, 145°E 17°S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: halophilum (loving saline habitats) is a Greek adjective and refers to the habitat the
species was discovered.
Description: Most features of G. halophilum have an ordinary variability (CV < 15%; Table 81);
of those important for the diagnosis of the species, only the number of kinetids comprising the
paroral membrane has a coefficient of variation of > 30%. However, the average is two and thus
far away from the congeners, except of G. algicola (see Remarks).

a From silver carbonate-impregnated specimens. Very likely, considerably inflated.
Size in vivo 67–93 × 23–37 µm, usually about 80 × 30 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 81 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
shape very similar to that of G. affine, i. e., ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid or elongate rectangular;
anterior body end obliquely rounded, posterior narrowly to broadly rounded (Fig. 219a, c, d,
220a–c; Table 81). Nuclear apparatus left of body´s midline, one ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid
macronuclear nodule in oral portion of cell, the second postoral in third quarter; with many
ordinarily-sized nucleoli. On average two broadly ellipsoid micronuclei attached to various sites
of macronuclear nodules (Fig. 219a, e, 220a–c; Table 81). Contractile vacuole not recognizable,
very likely due to the high salt concentration. Cortex very flexible, contains colourless, scattered
granules about 0.8 µm across in vivo (Fig. 219c); granules difficult to recognize due to the
opaque cytoplasm, do not impregnate with the protargol method used. Cytoplasm opaque because
studded with food vacuoles and countless granules. Feeds mainly on spore-forming bacteria,
rarely on small heterotrophic flagellates digested in vacuoles 4–10 µm across. Movement without
peculiarities; very flexible.
Cirri of ordinary length and thickness, arranged as in → G. strenuum, i. e., with comparatively
long frontoterminal row and long, slightly oblique anlage V, each composed of four to five cirri
(Fig. 219a, d, 220a–c, e; Table 81). Three frontal cirri about 15 µm long in vivo; between frontal
cirrus 2 and 3 a smaller, cirrus-like dot formed by three crossing fibres (Fig. 219d, 220b, e);
basis of frontal cirrus 1 slightly enlarged in some specimens; second cirrus of anlage III slightly
enlarged and at level of begin of right marginal row. Buccal cirrus far anterior of undulating
membranes, composed of six cilia. Invariably two transverse cirri one upon the other and about
15 µm long in vivo. Marginal cirri each composed of two minute rows with about 10 µm long
cilia; right marginal row commences subapically and ends subterminally, left row extends to
body`s midline posteriorly (Fig. 219a, d, 220a–c, e; Table 81).
Dorsal bristle pattern without peculiarities, bristles about 3 µm long in vivo and in protargol
preparations. Caudal cirri on posterior body end, difficult to recognize possibly because composed
of only two cilia (Fig. 219a, e, 220d; Table 81).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 2011), i. e., the adoral zone follows the anterior
and left body margin to bend abruptly into the cell at about 40% of body length (Fig. 219a, b, d,
220a–c, e; Table 81). Adoral zone flat, on average composed of 26 gonostomoid membranelles
with largest bases about 3 µm long in protargol preparations. Buccal cavity narrow, covered
by a convex lip bearing paroral membrane composed of an average of only two kinetids (Fig.
219a, b, 220c, e; Table 81). Endoral membrane commences at paroral membrane, almost straight.
Pharyngeal fibres extend slightly obliquely to right body margin.

specimen, length 80 µm. b, d, e: Ventral and dorsal view of holotype specimen, length 72 µm. Note the main feature of this new
species, viz., the paroral membrane which consists of an average of only two kinetids (b). The arrow marks a frontal cirrus-like

FT – frontoterminal cirri, FVC – frontoventral cirri, MI – micronuclei, PM – paroral membrane, TC – transverse cirri. Scale bars
30 µm.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in highly saline (> 30‰) and
slightly acidic (pH 6.4 in water) soil from a mangrove forest.
Remarks: Gonostomum halophilum has a clear identity because it has the lowest number (two)
of paroral kinetids in the family, followed by G. algicola which possesses an average of four and
has only one transverse cirrus (berger 2011, Foissner et al. 2002). Other rare features are the low
number of transverse cirri (two) and the location of the buccal cirrus far anterior of the undulating
membranes. The cirral pattern of G. halophilum is more similar to that of → G. strenuum than
to that of G. affine due to the frontoterminal cirral row and anlage V both composed of four to
five cirri (for a review, see berger 2011). For separation from → G. salinarum see that species.

Gonostomum salinarum nov. spec. (Fig. 221a–f, 222a–c; Table 81)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 80 × 30 µm; slightly elongate ovate or elongate rectangular. 2
macronuclear nodules and 2 micronuclei. Cortical granules in loose rows, colourless, about 1
× 0.5 µm in size. 3 frontal cirri, 4–5 frontoterminal cirri, 1 buccal cirrus right of anterior end of
paroral membrane, and 2 transverse cirri near rear end. 3 dorsal kineties and caudal cirri. Right
marginal row composed of an average of 21 cirri, left of 15. Adoral zone flat, extends about 52%
of body length, consists of an average of 28 membranelles. On average 10 paroral kinetids with
8–10 µm long cilia.
Type locality: Highly saline (> 30‰, pH 8) coastal soil from the Great Salt Lake in the
surroundings of the town of Brigham, Utah, USA, 112°5’W 44°N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Salinarum (living in saline environments) is a noun in plural genetive and thus does
not change the neuter when combined with a genus having another gender.
Description: Most features of G. salinarum have an ordinary variability (CV ≤ 15%), including
those important for the diagnosis of the species (Table 81).
Size in vivo 60–100 × 20–40 µm, usually about 80 × 30 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 81 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
shape very similar to that of G. affine, viz., usually slightly elongate ovate, rarely ellipsoid or
elongate rectangular; anterior body end narrower rounded than posterior (Fig. 221a, b, 222a,
b; Table 81). Nuclear apparatus left of body´s midline, consists of two, very rarely of three
macronuclear nodules and two micronuclei. Macronuclear nodules ellipsoid to elongate
ellipsoid, anterior nodule in second quarter of cell, posterior in third quarter, both with many
ordinary nucleoli. Micronuclei attached to various sites of macronucleus, globular to ellipsoid
(Fig. 221a, f, 222a–c; Table 81). Contractile vacuole slightly posterior to proximal end of adoral
zone of membranelles. Cortex flexible, contains loose rows of colourless, lenticular granules not
impregnating with the method used (Fig. 221c, d). Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to many
lipid droplets mainly in posterior quarter of cell and 1–4 µm across. Food vacuoles scattered
throughout body, about 7 µm across, contain bacteria. Movement without peculiarities.
Cirri of ordinary length and thickness, arranged as in → G. strenuum and → G. halophilum, i.
e., with comparatively long frontoterminal row and long row V, each composed of four to five
cirri (Fig. 221a, e, 222a, b; Table 81). Three slightly enlarged frontal cirri; buccal cirrus right of
anterior end of paroral membrane; one to three, on average two transverse cirri about 18 µm long
in vivo, project distinctly from body proper. Marginal cirri composed of two rows with three cilia
each, about 12 µm long; right row commences subapically and ends terminally, left row extends
to body´s midline posteriorly (Fig. 221a, e, 222a, b; Table 81).
Dorsal bristle pattern without peculiarities, bristles 3–4 µm long in vivo and in protargol
preparations. Caudal cirri in mid of posterior end (Fig. 221a, f; Table 81).

FVC – frontoventral cirri, G – cortical granules, MI – micronuclei, PM – paroral membrane, RM – right marginal cirral row,
TC – transverse cirri. Scale bars 30 µm.
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 2011), i. e., the adoral zone follows the anterior
and left body margin to bend abruptly into cell at about 52% of body length (Fig. 221a, e, 222a,
b; Table 81). Adoral zone flat, composed of an average of 28 gonostomoid membranelles with
largest bases 4–5 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations. Buccal cavity narrow, covered
by a convex lip bearing paroral membrane composed of an average of 10 kinetids with 8–10 µm
long cilia. Endoral membrane commences near mid and right of paroral, extends to proximal end
of adoral zone of membranelles. Pharyngeal fibres extend slightly obliquely to right body margin
(Fig. 221a, b, e, 222a, b; Table 81).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, viz., in soil mixed with halophyte
litter from a dry, flat pond on the coast of the Great Salt Lake in the surroundings of the town of
Brigham.
Remarks: Gonostomum salinarum is most similar to the Australian G. halophilum but differs
distinctly in the following, non-connected features (Table 81): length of adoral zone of
membranelles (52% vs. 40% of body length), number of marginal cirri (36 vs. 48), number of
659

paroral kinetids (10 vs. 2), length of endoral membrane (13 µm vs. 8 µm), and location of buccal
cirrus (right vs. far anterior of distal end of paroral membrane). The most important features are
the number of paroral kinetids and the location of the buccal cirrus.
Gonostomum caudatulum Foissner & heber nov. spec. (Fig. 223a–e, 224a–d;
Tables 82, 83)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 85 × 30 µm. Outline roughly pisciform, posterior end narrowed
to a short tail. 2 ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 2 globular micronuclei. 3 frontal cirri, 2
frontoterminal cirri, 1 buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane, on average 4
frontoventral cirri anterior of buccal vertex, and 5 subterminal transverse cirri. Right marginal
row on average composed of 13 cirri, left of 9. Dorsal bristles gradually elongated from 3 µm
660

anteriorly to 8 µm posteriorly. Caudal cirri thin, about 20 µm long in vivo. Adoral zone extends
about 58 % of body length, usually consists of 29 membranelles; paroral membrane about 1.2
times the length of endoral, on average consists of 12 wide-spaced (~ 1 cilium / µm) cilia.
Type locality: Sieved sand with much plant debris from the grass zone of a Resting area about
100 m off the sea, outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 22°54’S 43°12’W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Diminutive of the Latin participle caudatum (having a tail, tailed), referring to the
tail-like body end, an important feature of this species.

frontal cirri, LM – left marginal cirral row, MA – macronuclear nodules, MI – micronucleus, PM – paroral MeMbrane, RM – right
marginal cirral row, tC – transverse and pretransverse cirri. Scale bars 10 µm (b) and 25µm (a, c, d).
Description: Unfortunately, only 11 poorly fixed (see high CV of body width, Table 82) protargol-
impregnated specimens were available for the morphometric analysis. However, the main features,
i. e., the gradually elongated dorsal bristles and the tail-like posterior body end are well supported
by the life observations (Fig. 224a).
Size about 85 × 30 µm in vivo. Body flexible and colourless. Outline narrowly to ordinarily
pisciform with broadest region usually posterior to mid-body; left body margin in vivo less convex
than right; anterior body end distinctly narrowed, tail-like posterior end hardly recognizable in
the inflated, protargol-impregnated specimens (Fig. 223a, b, 224a). Nuclear apparatus slightly
662

left of main body axis within central quarters of cell, consists of two macronuclear nodules
and usually two (0–4) micronuclei (Fig. 223a, e, 224d; Table 82). Individual nodules rotund to
narrowly ellipsoid, on average 14 × 7 µm in protargol preparations; nucleoli up to 1.5 µm across.
Micronuclei globular to ellipsoid, about 2.8 × 2.6 µm after protargol impregnation. Cortical
granules not seen in vivo, but loose rows of minute (~ 0.5 µm) granules recognizable in 3 out
of 11 protargol-impregnated cells. Contractile vacuole in mid-body slightly left of cell centre
(Fig. 223a, 224a). Cytoplasm colourless, contains 1–4 µm-sized crystals. Food vacuoles scattered
throughout cytoplasm, about 5 µm across, contain bacteria and flagellates (Fig. 223a). Hurries to
and fro, frequently changing direction.
Cirral pattern as typical for Gonostomum (berger 2011) and shown in Figures 223a, d, and
224c. Invariably three frontal cirri in convex pattern following anterior body margin, thickened
and about 15 µm long in protargol preparations. Two frontoterminal cirri, anterior cirrus in gap
between right marginal row and adoral zone, posterior cirrus at level of uppermost right marginal
cirrus, in protargol preparations about 12 µm long. Usually four (three to five) frontoventral
cirri in coarse row not extending beyond buccal vertex, anteriormost cirrus usually thickened,
8–10 µm long. Buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral, thickened and about 12 µm long.
Five transverse/pretransverse cirri at base of tail and in gap between marginal rows, three cirri
thickened, two ordinary, about 12 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations. Marginal cirral
rows end subterminally, right row commences at level of posterior frontoterminal cirrus, on
average consists of 13 cirri, left of 9; cirri composed of two kineties with cilia 8–10 µm long in
vivo and after protargol impregnation (Fig. 223d, 224c; Table 82).
About 51 dorsal bristles in three rows; row 1 slightly shortened anteriorly. Bristles carefully
observed in vivo, stiff and obliquely directed backwards, gradually increase in length from 3 µm
anteriorly to 8 µm posteriorly and from 2.5 µm to 6 µm in protargol preparations, respectively.
Three caudal cirri, one at end of each bristle row, composed of only few basal bodies with cilia in
vivo up to 20 µm long, about 12 µm in protargol preparations (Fig. 223a–c, e, 224a, d; Table 82).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 2011), i. e., adoral zone follows body margin
and bends abruptly into cell at about 58 % of body length; on average composed of 29 ordinary
membranelles, bases of largest membranelles about 5 µm long in protargol preparations,
cilia about 15 µm long in vivo and 12 µm after protargol impregnation (Fig. 223a, d, 224c;
Table 82). Endoral membrane ordinary, proximal end near buccal vertex, about 11 µm long.
Paroral membrane commences at level of buccal cirrus, on average 12 µm long after protargol
impregnation, composed of comparatively widely spaced cilia (about 1 cilium / µm) with spacing
often gradually increasing anteriorly; cilia about 10 µm long in vivo. Buccal lip covers buccal
cavity, sometimes conspicuously enlarged and then projecting from body margin, hyaline, soon
becoming undetectable under slight coverslip pressure. Pharyngeal fibres directed to right body
margin, about 10 µm long in protargol preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at the sandy, slightly saline (10 ‰) and acidic (pH
5.2) type locality. The slender shape, the tail, and the long dorsal bristles and caudal cirri of G.
caudatulum could be adaptations to the sandy habitat.

Remarks: The combination of a tailed posterior body end and gradually elongated dorsal bristles

sedis in Gonostomum, berger 2011) but G. namibiense lacks long dorsal bristles and differs in
the cirral pattern while U. macrostoma stands out by its densely arranged paroral cilia, indicating
that it does not belong to the genus.

Gonostomum caudatulum is morphologically and morphometrically (Table 83) possibly most
closely related to G. affine because of the similar cirral pattern and the occurrence of G. affine
populations with long dorsal bristles or a tail (for a review, see berger 2011). gellèrt (1956)
reported long dorsal bristles for G. bryonicolum and G. spirotrichoides, and buitKaMP (1977b)
for Trachelostyla affine. However, these species are tailless and details about their dorsal bristles
are lacking. A tail-like posterior body end has been reported also for G. geleii by gellèrt (1957),
unfortunately without any information about the dorsal side. Nonetheless, synonymy with G.
caudatulum seems unlikely because, according to his illustration, G. geleii has a lower number of
665

frontal-ventral-transverse cirri (11 vs. 15) and adoral membranelles (17 vs. 29).
The gradually elongated dorsal bristles and the tailed body end of G. caudatulum are best observed
in vivo. A morphometric comparison of G. caudatulum with several G. affine populations (Table
83) reveals that only the spacing of the paroral cilia (0.9–1.1 cilia / µm vs. 1.1–1.8) and the
paroral:endoral length ratio (1.0–1.4 vs. 0.4–1.1) are possibly of value for separating these species
in protargol preparations.
Gonostomum singhii KaMra, KuMar & saPra, 2008 (Fig. 225a–h, 226a–g, 227a–
d, 228a–g; Table 84)
Improved diagnosis (for three populations, i. e., including the Indian type): Size in vivo about 70
× 26 µm or 100 × 32 µm; elongate ellipsoid. 2 ordinarily spaced macronuclear nodules. Cortical
granules in loose rows, about 2 × 1 µm in size. 3 frontal cirri, 2 frontoterminal cirri, 1 buccal
cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane, 2 frontoventral cirral pairs, 2 pretransverse cirri
in special pattern, and 4 transverse cirri. Right marginal row composed of an average of 17–19
cirri, left of 13. Dorsal bristles 3–4 µm long; 3 thin caudal cirri. Adoral zone slightly sigmoid,
extends about 53% of body length, consists of an average of 27 or of 34 membranelles; undulating
membranes long, paroral composed of 15–19 kinetids on average.
Type locality: Soil from the Valley of Flowers National Park, India, 30°41’ to 30°48’N and
79°33’ to 79°46’E.
Voucher slides: 4 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated Australian specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The main voucher
specimen and other relevant cells have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Furthermore, 6 voucher slides from the Venezuelan population have been deposited in the same
repository.
Etymology: The species name is derived from singhi, the local name of the common Indian food
fish Heteropneustus fossilis whose long barbles resemble the frontal membranelles of the ciliate.
Redescription: We studied two populations, one from Australia where many specimens occurred,
and another from Venezuelan site (24), where only seven cells were found in the protargol slides,
one strongly inflated and thus excluded from width measurement (Table 84). Both populations
are so similar that they are described together.
Size in vivo 80–115 × 30–45 µm, usually about 100 × 32 µm, as calculated from some live
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 84 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
shape inconspicuous, i. e., elongate ellipsoid with anterior region more narrowed than posterior;
laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 225a, d, f, 226a–d, 227a, 228b, g; Table 84). Two ellipsoid
to very elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules with many ordinary nucleoli. Micronuclei
highly variable in number, on average three and two in Australian and Venezuelan specimens,
respectively; globular to ellipsoid, on average broadly ellipsoid (Fig. 226a–d, 227a, d, 228a–c, g;
Table 84). Contractile vacuole posterior and right of buccal vertex, with long collecting canals

size (Fig. 225g, h, 227a, b), elongate to about 50 µm long filaments after extrusion. Cytoplasm
colourless, contains three types of inclusions: (i) a moderate number of crystals 2–10 µm in

in a second Australian population; (iii) a moderate number of lipid droplets 2–4 µm in size
(Fig. 225d, e, 227a, b); in two out of the seven Venezuelan specimens occur lenticular, deeply
impregnating structures, possibly bacteria (Fig. 228f). Food vacuoles 7–10 µm across, contain
coccal cyanobacteria, ordinary bacteria, flagellate cysts, and a heterotrophic euglenid (Peranema

by the transverse cirri. Marginal cirri about 12 µm long each composed of two rows of basal
bodies; right row shortened anteriorly and posteriorly, composed of an average of 19 cirri, left
marginal row composed of 13 cirri on average, extends to mid of posterior body end (Fig. 225a,

and following left body margin before bending abruptly inwards at about 55% of body length;
on average composed of 34 ordinary membranelles with largest bases 4–5 µm long in protargol
preparations (Fig. 225a, d, 226a–d, 227a, c, 228a–d, g; Table 84). Buccal cavity of ordinary size,
flat; buccal lip moderately convex, bears paroral membrane composed of an average of 15–19
narrowly spaced cilia 6 µm long in protargol preparations, with a minute gap in some specimens.
Endoral membrane anteriorly distinctly shorter than paroral while distinctly longer posteriorly
extending to buccal vertex; undulating membrane pattern depending on preparation and angle
viewed, i. e., the paroral may be right or left of the endoral. Pharyngeal fibres about 20 µm long,
extend obliquely to right body margin (Fig. 225a, d, 226a–d, 227a, c, 228a–d, f, g; Table 84).
Ontogenesis: This is highly similar to that of G. algivora, as described by Foissner et al. (2002),
and of G. affine and G. kuehnelti as described by eigner (1999). Thus, we show only some early
stages with typical primary primordia (Fig. 225b, c, 226f) and a late stage where the frontoventral
cirral pairs are organizing (Fig. 226g).
Occurrence and ecology: The Australian sample was composed of the upper 5 cm litter and soil
under Nothofagus trees; pH 4.1, about 200 m above sea level. In Venezuela, G. singhii occurred
at site (24), viz., in soil of a Tachypogon savannah. In India, it occurred also in soil treated with
the non-flooded Petri dish method (see type locality above). Possibly restricted to Gondwana.
Remarks: Many features of Gonostomum singhii are between → G. lajacola and the G. affine
complex (Table 84). It differs from → G. lajacola by the sparse (vs. dense) cortical granulation,
the length of the dorsal bristles (3–4 µm vs. up to 10 µm), the number of transverse cirri (4 vs.
5), and the number of frontoventral cirral pairs (2 vs. 3). From → G. affine, as described by
berger (1999, 2011) and Foissner et al. (2001), it differs mainly by the specific location of the
pretransverse cirri and the number of paroral cilia (~ 10 vs. 15–19). Additionally, G. affine rarely
makes as distinct frontoventral cirral pairs as G. singhii, the caudal cirri are thicker, and the adoral
zone of membranelles usually occupies 50% or less of body length.
When finishing the text for this “new species”, we recognized that it has been described by
KaMra et al. (2008). Unfortunately, their description is not very detailed and even partially
incorrect. This concerns the pretransverse cirri which are one upon the other the anterior cirrus
being slightly left of the posterior one while their photograph Figure 9d shows the opposite and
matches our data (Fig. 225a, 226a–e, 227c, 228a, b, g). Further, we disagree that the cirri of G.
singhii are hypertrophied. In our populations, cirral length is similar to the Indian specimens
and the marginal cirri consist of two rows of basal bodies, as usual. KaMra et al. (2008) do not
provide such data. Third, KaMra et al. (2008) place the caudal cirri in the centre of the posterior
body end. Again, their photograph 9e shows that they are in and slightly right of body`s midline
which matches our observations.
There is some indication that the Australian and the Venezuelan populations are sufficiently
different from the Indian G. singhii to be classified as a subspecies: the adoral zone is longer (on
average 55% vs. 49% of body length); the number of adoral membranelles is higher (on average
34 vs. 27), possibly due to the higher body length (100 × 32 µm vs. 70 × 26 µm in vivo); and
the number of dorsal bristles is markedly higher, especially in the Venezuelan specimens (33 vs.
18 in row 1). The sole feature that hinders us is the very stable pattern of the pretransverse and
transverse cirri in all populations.

Gonostomum lajacola nov. spec. (Fig. 229a–d, 230a–c; Table 84)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 35 µm; ellipsoid. 2 ordinarily spaced macronuclear nodules.
Cortical granules in rough rows, numerous, colourless, about 3 × 1 µm in size. 3 frontal cirri, 2
frontoterminal cirri, 1 buccal cirrus subapical of paroral membrane, 2 frontoventral cirral pairs,
and 5–7 pretransverse and transverse cirri. Right marginal row composed of an average of 18
cirri, left of 12. Dorsal bristles gradually elongating from 3 µm anteriorly to 10 µm posteriorly.
Three thin caudal cirri. Adoral zone extends 59% of body length, consists of an average of 32
membranelles; undulating membranes long, paroral composed of 23 cilia on average.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (32), i.e., soil under a carpet of Velosiacean plants in a lithotelma
(Laja) between the Agricultural Research Station and the airport of Puerto Ayacucho, 67°36’W
5°41’N.
Type slides: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and
other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of Laja (indigenous name for ephemeral puddles
on granitic outcroppings) and the Latin verb colere (to live in) referring to the habitat the species
was discovered.
Description: This species was very rare. One specimen was used for live observation and seven
cells, most rather strongly inflated, were found in the protargol slides. However, the species has
a clear identity by a combination of four features (see “Remarks”). Thus, we describe it but
emphasize the need for further live observation and a more detailed morphometry.
Size in vivo 85–115 × 30–40 µm, usually about 100 × 35 µm, as calculated from a live specimen and
the morphometric data in Table 84 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body shape inconspicuous,
i. e., elongate ellipsoid and up to 2:1 flattened laterally (Fig. 229a, 230a). Nuclear apparatus in
central quarters of body slightly left of midline (Fig. 229a, b, 230a–c; Table 84). Two ellipsoid to
elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules with a distance of about 15 µm in protargol preparations;
anterior nodule slightly larger than posterior; with many minute nucleoli. Usually two globular
to broadly ellipsoid micronuclei near or attached to macronuclear nodules and about 2 µm in
size. Contractile vacuole not observed. Cortex very flexible, conspicuous because studded with
granules, forming a 3–4 µm wide fringe; individual granules in rather dense rows, colourless,

three pairs of frontoventral cirri, arrows) but has a tailed (vs. broadly rounded) body, a short (vs. long) paroral membrane, five
(vs. four) transverse cirri, and shorter (up to 4 µm vs. up to 10 µm) dorsal bristles. f: Cortical granules, about 1 × 0.3 µm. AZM

about 3×1 µm in size, impregnate lightly with the protargol method used (Fig. 229a, c, 230a–c).
Cytoplasm colourless, contains some lipid droplets and up to 12 µm-sized food vacuoles with
bacteria and their indigestible spores (Fig. 229a, c).
Cirri arranged in typical Gonostomum pattern (berger 1999, 2011) shown in Figures 229a, b.

cirral row. Buccal cirrus subapical and right of paroral membrane. Usually three oblique pairs of
frontoventral cirri. Five to seven pretransverse and slightly thickened transverse cirri about 20
µm long in vivo and thus projecting from body proper. Marginal cirri about 17 µm long; right row
commences far subapically, composed of an average of 18 cirri, ends subterminally; left marginal
row composed of an average of 12 cirri, extends to mid of posterior body end.
Three rows of dorsal bristles, their length increasing from 3–4 µm anteriorly to about 10 µm
posteriorly (Fig. 229d). Three fine and about 20 µm long caudal cirri in and right of body`s
midline (Fig. 229a, b).
678

Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 1999), i. e., the slightly sigmoidal adoral zone
follows the body margin and bends abruptly into the cell at about 59% of body length, on average
composed of 32 ordinary membranelles with largest bases 4–5 µm width in protargol preparations;
cilia of frontal membranelles about 25 µm long, those of ventral membranelles up to 15 µm long in
protargol preparations (Fig. 229a, b, 230a–c; Table 84). Buccal cavity narrow and flat; buccal lip
slightly to moderately convex, bears paroral membrane composed of an average of 23 narrowly
spaced cilia 6 µm long in protargol preparations. Endoral membrane anteriorly distinctly shorter
than paroral while distinctly longer posteriorly extending to buccal vertex, cilia about 8 µm long
in protargol preparations (Fig. 229a, b, 230a–c; Table 84).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Grew poorly in the non-flooded
Petri dish culture, indicating that it could be a limnetic species.
Remarks: In vivo, the new species looks like the very common Gonostomum affine (Fig. 229a).
However, G. lajacola and G. affine differ by four distinct features (for data on the latter, see Table
84; berger 1999; and Foissner et al. 2001, who studied seven populations): length of the adoral
zone of membranelles (59% vs. 49% of body length); the cortical granulation (granules in dense
rows and ~ 3 µm long vs. lacking or dispersed and ~ 1 µm in size); the length of the dorsal bristles
(gradually increasing to ~ 10 µm vs. 3–4 µm throughout); and, especially, the number of paroral
cilia (on average 23 vs. 11). Gonostomum bryonicolum, G. spirotrichoides, and → G. caudatulum
have also long dorsal bristles but their bodies are distinctly narrowed posteriorly and the number
and arrangement of the FVT-cirri is different. As concerns G. namibiense, see explanation to Fig.
229e. For the separation from → G. singhii, see that species.
Gonostomum multinucleatum nov. spec. (Fig. 231a–i, 232a–m; Table 85)
Diagnosis (for two populations): Size in vivo about 80 × 20 µm; very slenderly ellipsoid and
usually slightly sigmoid. On average 13 globular to ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 3 broadly
ellipsoid micronuclei. Cortical granules in rough rows, slightly yellowish, 0.5–0.9 µm across. 3
frontal cirri, 2 frontoterminal cirri, 1 buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane, and 2
frontoventral cirral pairs. Right marginal row composed of an average of 16–23 cirri, left of 11–17.
Dorsal bristles 3 µm long; 2 to 3 thin caudal cirri. Adoral zone gonostomoid, posterior half covered
by the strongly convex buccal lip, extends about 38% of body length, consists of 20 membranelles
on average; Buccal cavity very narrow and flat; paroral membrane composed of about 7 kinetids.
Type locality: Soil from an abandoned cacao plantago near Punta Pirikiki, about 54 km south of
Limon, Caribbean Sea coast of Costa Rica, Central America, 82°40’W, 9°40’N.
Type slides: 1 holotype and 5 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and
other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. Furthermore, 4
voucher slides from the Brazilian population have been stored in the same repository.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the Latin quantifier mult- (many), the thematic
vowel •i-, and the Latin participle nucleatum (having a nucleus). It refers to the multiple
macronuclear nodules, a main feature of this species.

Description: We investigated a Costa Rican and a Brazilian population. The specimens
of the former are smaller than those of the latter by 12 µm (20%) on average. Very likely,
this is not a preparation artifact because they have also less marginal cirri and bristles
in dorsal kinety 2. However, the in vivo measurements of the Costa Rican specimens
match well the protargol data of the Brazilian specimens: 70–90 × 17 –20 µm vs. 69–113 ×
15–25 µm, x 87 × 18 when 15% preparation shrinkage is added. Thus, we calculated
an overall in vivo size of 80 × 20 µm for the “representative specimen” (Fig. 231a).
Size of protargol-impregnated Costa Rican specimens 53–87 × 14–25 µm, on average 72 × 20 µm
when 15% preparation shrinkage is added; Brazilian specimens 69–113 × 15–25 µm, on average
87 × 18 µm (see above and Table 85). Body very slenderly ellipsoid (length:width ratio ~ 4:1) and

nodules occasionally with a central, cube-shaped nucleolus surrounded by several granular
nucleoli (Fig. 232d–f). One to four, on average 2.6 broadly ellipsoid micronuclei near and attached
to macronuclear nodules. Contractile vacuole in or near mid-body posterior of buccal vertex (Fig.
231d). Cortex very flexible, contains loose rows of granules not impregnating with the protargol
method used; individual granules globular to broadly ellipsoid, slightly yellowish, only 0.9 × 0.6
µm in size and thus difficult to recognize in vivo (Fig. 231a, d). Cytoplasm colourless, contains
some lipid droplets about 2 µm across and 4–6 µm-sized food vacuoles with bacteria and their
spores; does not contain crystals; in posterior body half occasionally a seemingly empty vacuole
(Fig. 231a). Glides rapidly on microscope slides and soil particles, showing pronounced flexibility.
Cirri arranged in Gonostomum pattern shown in berger (1999, 2011) and in Figures 231a, b, f,
h, 232a, c–h. Invariably three slightly thickened frontal cirri in strongly convex row following
anterior body margin; base of frontal cirrus 1 about twice as long as that of cirri 2 and 3 (Fig. 231a,
b, f, 232a, c–f, m). Two frontoterminal cirri in gap between adoral zone and right marginal cirral
row. Buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane, composed of six cilia. Invariably
two oblique pairs of frontoventral cirri each composed of two rows each with four cilia; a single,
very rarely two or three frontoventral cirri posterior of second pair. One, very rarely two transverse
685

cirri in mid of posterior cell margin, composed of four 12–16 µm long cilia; occurrence of only
a single transverse cirrus confirmed by a late divider. Marginal cirri in vivo about 10 µm long,
composed of six cilia in anterior quarters of rows and of only two to four cilia in posterior
quarter; intracirral distance gradually and distinctly increasing from anterior to posterior.
Three rows of dorsal bristles, 3 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations; row 1
distinctly shortened anteriorly. Three, rarely only two caudal cirri each composed of
two to four cilia 12 µm long in vivo. Marginal, transverse, and caudal cirri produce a
rather distinct “brush” at posterior body end (Fig. 231c, g, i, 232a, c, f, i–l; Table 85).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 1999, 2011), i. e., adoral zone slightly sigmoid
and following body margin before bending abruptly into cell proximally at 38% of body
length; zone on average composed of 20 membranelles with cilia about 12 µm long in anterior
half; membranellar ciliary rows 3 and 4 very short and of same length in few to many ventral
membranelles providing them a hook-like appearance (Fig. 231a, f, 232a–g, m; Table 85).
Buccal cavity very narrow and flat; buccal lip distinctly convex covering proximal half of adoral
zone of membranelles (Fig. 231a, e), bears paroral membrane composed of about seven cilia
10 µm long in vivo. Endoral membrane right of paroral, anteriorly shorter then paroral while
much longer posteriorly extending to end of adoral zone of membranelles. Pharyngeal fibres
short, obliquely directed to right body margin (Fig. 231a, b, e, f, 232a, c, d, f, g, m; Table 85).
Occurrence and ecology: Gonostomum multinucleatum has been found in two soil samples
from Costa Rica, in a sample from Brazil, and in Venezuelan samples (54, 61), indicating
wide distribution in Central and South America. Costa Rican sample 2: Highly saline sand and
soil from the Carribean coast at Punta Cocles, pH 7.6 in water. Costa Rican sample 3 (type
locality): Soil and litter from an abandoned cacao plantago at Punta Cocles. Soil brown, pH
7.3 in water. Brazilian sample: Abandoned nest material of the termite Anoplotermes sp.
on the Ilha de Marchantaria, i. e., an island in the Amazon River (sample kindly provided
by Dr. Christopher Martius, Univ. Göttingen, Germany; for details, see Martius 1994).
Remarks: Among the congeners reviewed in berger (1999, 2011) only G. kuehnelti is
multinucleate. However, this species is easily distinguished from G. multinucleatum by the ellipsoid
body (vs. slenderly ellipsoid, length:width ratio 2.5:1 vs. 4:1) and the number of transverse cirri
(4 vs. 1). More difficult is the separation from Paragonostomum simplex Foissner et al. (2005a).
This species has a stouter posterior body end, lacks transverse cirri (vs. one cirrus present), has
four (vs. two) frontoterminal cirri and four (vs. one) cirri posterior of the two frontoventral cirral
pairs. These differences are difficult to recognize in vivo, suggesting that identifications should
be controled in protargol preparations.
Gonostomum bromelicola nov. spec. (Fig. 233a–l, 234a–m; Table 86)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 35 µm. Ellipsoid with distinctly narrowed oral region. 2
macronuclear nodules and 2 minute micronuclei about 1.5 µm in diameter. Cortical granules
scattered and in loose rows, colourless, 3–4 × 1 µm in size. Cirri comparatively thick and long,
except of three fine caudal cirri. 3 frontal cirri, first rarely slightly enlarged; 2 frontoterminal cirri;
1 buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane; 2 pretransverse cirri in specific pattern;
and 5 transverse cirri 16% distant from posterior body end. Right marginal row commences 20%

Type locality: Tanks of Achmea paniculigera in Jamaica, 77°41’W 18°17’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 5 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the genus group name Bromelia (the plant on
which the ciliate lives), the thematic vowel •i-, and the Latin verb colere (to live in), referring to
the habitat the species was discovered.
Description: Most features of ordinary variability, i. e., with coefficients of variability < 15%
(Table 86), except of width of buccal cavity (CV = 24.2%) and posterior body end to right and
left marginal cirral row (CV = 33.2% and 56.5%).
Size in vivo 85–110 × 30–45 µm, usually about 100 × 35 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 86 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body

Two, very rarely three macronuclear nodules elongate ellipsoid on average; anterior nodule
underneath of anterior half of paroral membrane, posterior close to proximal portion of adoral
zone; with many minute nucleoli. Two to five, on average two micronuclei attached to or near to
macronuclear nodules, small compared to size of cell, i. e., about 1.5 µm across (Fig. 233a, c, j, k,
234g, h, j, k–m; Table 86). Contractile vacuole underneath proximal portion of adoral zone (Fig.
233a). Cortex very flexible, studded with colourless granules forming a rather distinct fringe in
vivo and in protargol preparations; individual granules in vivo about 3–4 × 1µm in size, scattered
and in short rows (Fig. 233a, g, 234b, i). Cytoplasm colourless, usually packed with 5–10 µm-
sized food vacuoles containing bacteria and small heterotrophic flagellates (Polytomella sp.,
Anisonema sp.); some lipid droplets 0.5–1.5 µm across; and rather many stout crystals 2–3 × 1–2
694

µm in size (Fig. 233a, g). Glides rapidly on microscope slides and creeps between mud particles,
showing great flexibility (Fig. 233d).
Cirri comparatively thick and long, e. g., marginal cirri composed of three rows of cilia and
about 15 µm long in vivo (Fig. 233a, b, 234a, c, h); arranged in typical Gonostomum pattern
(berger 2011) shown in Figures 233a, b, i, 234a, c, g, h. Three frontal cirri in strongly convex
row following anterior body margin, thick and about 25 µm long in vivo, basis of first frontal
cirrus slightly enlarged in some specimens. Two frontoterminal cirri and two frontoventral cirral
pairs with cilia 20–25 µm long in vivo; posterior cirrus of anlage III slightly enlarged and at level
of posterior frontoterminal cirrus. Buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane. Two
pretransverse and five transverse cirri far (16% of body length) subterminal and thus only slightly
projecting from body proper although about 25 µm long in vivo; pretransverse cirri clearly
separate, form an oblique pair in cavity of transverse cirri. Two marginal cirral rows with cirral
distances gradually decreasing from anterior to posterior except of first two cirri of right marginal
row slightly narrower spaced than the following; right marginal row commencing far (20% of
body length) subapically and ends slightly subterminally; left marginal row extends to midline of
body posteriorly (Fig. 233a, b, i, 234a, b, g, h; Table 86).
Three dorsal kineties with a total of 94 kinetids on average, a high number compared to most
congeners; kineties 1 and 2 slightly shortened anteriorly. Cilia (bristles) 3–4 µm long in anterior
and posterior third of rows while 4–5 µm in middle third. Middle row invariably with one, very
rarely two breaks or irregularities posterior of mid-body, an outstanding feature resembling the
ontogenetic break of dorsal kinety 3 in the oxytrichids s. str.; development of break seen in two
late dividers (Fig. 233l). Three, very rarely only two fine caudal cirri each composed of four cilia
about 20 µm long in vivo (Fig. 233a, c, j–l, 234b, k–m; Table 86).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (berger 2011), i. e., the adoral zone follows the anterior
and left body margin and bends abruptly into the cell at about 56% of body length; bend associated
with a slightly projecting concavity that we call “preoral dish” (Fig. 233a, e, f, 234b). Adoral zone
flat to slightly sigmoid, on average composed of 37 gonostomoid membranelles with largest bases
about 4 µm width in protargol preparations (Fig. 233a, b, i, 234a, c, d, g, h, j; Table 86). Buccal
cavity flat and rather narrow, partially covered by a convex lip. Paroral membrane right of buccal
lip, composed of an average of 14 kinetids with cilia 15–20 µm (!) long in vivo and in SEM
micrographs (Fig. 233a, 234a, c, d), an outstanding length not reported from any other hypotrich.
Endoral membrane commencing slightly posterior of paroral and extending to proximal end of
adoral zone, cilia about 20 µm long and distinctly beating in the pharynx extending obliquely to
right body margin.
Resting cyst: Resting cysts colourless, globular to slightly ellipsoid, on average 37.6 × 36.5 µm in
size (Fig. 233h, 234e, f; Table 86). Wall smooth, without zonation, 1–1.5 µm thick. Macronuclear
nodules not fused. Cytoplasm studded with lipid droplets or autophagous vacuoles up to 4 µm
across and countless granules smaller than 1.5 µm.
Molecular phylogeny: The SS-rDNA of G. bromelicola has been sequenced by dunthorn et
al. (2012) where it has been named “Gonostomum (undescr. sp.?)”; the GenBank number is JQ
695

723970. Gonostomum bromelicola is in a well supported clade (ML99/BI/100) containing G.
strenuum and Cotterillia bromelicola Foissner & stoeCK, 2011 while G. namibiense belongs to
another clade that is poorly supported (–/62) but provides an indication that Gonostomum is not
monophyletic.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. A raw culture was obtained by
adding some wheat grains to the sample distributed in a Petri dish. However, it grew slowly and
only for a few days.
Obviously, G. bromelicola is a rare species but the common G. affine is also infrequent in tank
bromeliads. We could not find a reason for the break in dorsal kinety 2 but it provides the species
with a unique identity.
Remarks: There are three similar species all described in the present monograph: G. lajacola, G.
bromelicola, and G. fraterculus. Gonostomum fraterculus differs from G. bromelicola by (i) the
number of paroral kinetids (22 vs. 14), (ii) the length of the paroral cilia (~ 10 µm vs. 15–20 µm),
and (iii) dorsal kinety 2 (without vs. with distinct break).
Gonostomum lajacola differs from G. bromelicola by (i) the number of paroral kinetds (23 vs.
14), (ii) the length of the paroral cilia (~ 6 µm vs. 15–20 µm), (iii) the length of the dorsal bristles
(up to 10 µm vs. up to 5 µm), and (iv) dorsal kinety 2 (without vs. with distinct break).
Gonostomum fraterculus differs from G. lajacola by (i) the length of the paroral cilia (~ 6 µm
vs. ~ 10 µm), (ii) the location of the buccal cirrus (at level of begin of paroral membrane vs.
subapical of paroral membrane), (iii) the number of adoral membranelles (39 vs. 32), (iv) the
length of the dorsal bristles (4–5 µm vs. up to 10 µm), and (v) the number of dorsal bristles in
kinety 3 (29 vs. 18).
Gonostomum fraterculus nov. spec. (Fig. 235a–d, 236a–d; Table 86)
Diagnosis: As G. bromelicola but living in soil and without break in dorsal kinety 2.
Type locality: Surface litter and loamy soil up to 5cm depth on an island in the Amazon River,
Janauari region, outskirts of the town of Manaus, Brazil, 60°W 4°S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin species name is an apposite noun composed of frater (brother) and the
diminutive culum (small, similar), referring to → G. bromelicola which is very likely derived
from fraterculus.
Description and Remarks: Gonostomum fraterculus is very likely the ancestor of → G.
bromelicola, differing mainly in having an ordinary dorsal kinety 2 and living in soil (vs. in tanks

of bromeliads). However, the following features are also different, adding to the distinctness
of this species (Fig. 235a–d, 236a–d; Table 86): (i) fraterculus is on average more slender than
bromelicola (length:width ratio 3.2:1 vs. 2.6:1), (ii) the micronuclei are larger (on average 2.5
× 2.1 µm vs. 1.5 × 1.3 µm), (iii) the cirri are of ordinary thickness (marginal cirri composed of
2 vs. 3 ciliary rows) and length (e.g., transverse cirri 18 µm vs. 25 µm), (iv) the right marginal
cirral row commences more anteriorly (13% vs. 20% of body length), (v) the number of paroral
kinetids is higher by 7% relative to body length, and (vi) the cilia of the paroral kinetids are
shorter (~ 10 µm vs. 20 µm). The shape of the adoral zone of membranelles is very variable (Fig.
236a–d). For separation from → G. lajacola, see → G. bromelicola.
Although these are a lot of differences, the first impression of a close relationship with → G.
bromelicola is overwhelming because all differences are quantitative except of the lack of a break
in dorsal kinety 2 and the terrestrial habitat. The break of dorsal kinety 2 of → G. bromelicola has
heavy taxonomic weight because the dorsal ciliature is very stable in hypotrichs.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Considering the Amazon floods, a
wide distribution is very likely.

The sample was taken about 20 km east of the town of Manaus in the Janauari region where are
many small islands. The islands are covered with a primary (?) rain forest and are flooded by the
Rio Solimões during high water periods. The sample was a collection of litter, soil and roots from
0–5 cm: litter layer up to 2 cm thick, followed by a rather conspicuous root-carpet mixed with
brown, humic soil; mineral soil under root-carpet loamy, brownish; pH 5.1.
Families Oxytrichidae and Urosomoididae
The huge morphologic diversity of these families is confirmed by their genetic diversity, especially
the genus Oxytricha s. l. whose species are irregularly distributed over the molecular hypotrich
tree (sChMidt et al. 2007a, Paiva et al. 2009, Foissner et al. 2014a, singh & KaMra 2015). These
indicates polyphyly possibly based on fast radiation events (Foissner et al. 2011). What hypotrich
specialists formerly often considered as “high variation” is now frequently recognized as a new
species or genus.
A first split of the time-honoured genus Oxytricha was performed by berger (1999), using the
absence vs. presence of transverse and caudal cirri. We continue and split Oxytricha and some
relatives into eight new genera, using several distinct features, such as the structure of the resting
cyst, the nuclear pattern, and the genesis of the dorsal ciliature. This split is not very radical,
considering that there are very likely thousands of undescribed hypotrichs (we still have about
150 undescribed species in our notebook!).
Oxytricha lithofera nov. spec. (Fig. 237a–i, 238a–e; Table 87)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 70 × 25 µm; usually elongate ellipsoid. 2 abutting, ellipsoid
macronuclear nodules and 2 globular micronuclei. 2 conspicuous lithosomes, one subapical the
other subterminal. Cirri thick, right marginal row commences at level of buccal vertex. 6 rows
of dorsal bristles gradually increasing in length from about 3 µm anteriorly to 10 µm posteriorly;
distal bristle region with increased protargol affinity. Caudal cirri conspicuous because about
25 µm long. Adoral zone of membranelles extends about 36% of body length, composed of an
average of 20 membranelles. Buccal cavity very narrow and shallow. Undulating membranes
straight, optically side by side.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (57), i. e., moss on stones and soil from a small cave in the Golfete
de Cuare del Indio, 69°W 11°N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens
have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the Greek noun lithos (stone) and the Latin verb
fero (carrying). It refers to the conspicuous lithosomes.

specimen, length 70 µm. The arrow marks the begin of the right marginal cirral row. Note the lithosomes and the long caudal cirri.
c: Dorsal bristle, 10 × 0.4 µm. d: Oxytricha lithofera has two conspicuous lithosomes, each in a vacuole surrounded by rather
refractive granules (lithosome precursors?). e, f: Oxytricha siseris resembles O. lithofera in many features (e. g. begin of the right
marginal row at level of buccal vertex, arrowhead; nuclear apparatus) but lacks lithosomes and has another structure of the oral
apparatus. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, CC – caudal cirri, DB – dorsal bristles, LT – lithosomes, MI – micronuclei. Scale
bars 10 µm (d) and 30 µm (a, b, e, f).
Description: Size in vivo 60–85 × 23–32 µm, usually about 70 × 25 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 87 adding 15% preparation shrinkage.
Body shape simple, viz., ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid, on average 2.8:1; rarely elongate
quadrangular; up to 2:1 flattened laterally (Fig. 237a, b, g, 238d; Table 87). Nuclear apparatus
in mid-body slightly left of midline, remarkable because of abutting macronuclear nodules (Fig.
237a, h, 238a, d; Table 87). Anterior macronuclear nodule commences slightly anterior to buccal
vertex on average, outline rather irregular, broadly to elongate ellipsoid, rarely very elongate
ellipsoid, variation of nodule width thus high (20.4%), on average 15 × 7 µm in protargol
preparations; many nucleoli up to 2 µm across. One or two, usually two globular micronuclei
about 2 µm across and attached to various sites of macronuclear nodules, never in between.
Contractile vacuole in or near mid-body at left cell margin, with short collecting canals (Fig.
237a). Cortex colourless, very flexible, without specific granules. Cytoplasm colourless, usually
contains some food vacuoles and minute crystals, dominated by two highly refractive and thus
conspicuous lithosomes, one subapical the other subterminal (Fig. 237a, d, 238a, c). Individual
lithosomes hollow, 4–6 µm across, within a vacuole 6–8 µm in diameter and surrounded by many

rather refractive granules, very likely lithosome precursors; wall 1–1.5 µm thick, dissolves during
protargol preparation and does not stain with methyl green-pyronin, showing its inorganic nature.
Food vacuoles 5–15 µm across, contain heterotrophic euglenids and protist cysts. Swims rather
rapidly and creeps on mud accumulations, showing great flexibility.
Ventral cirral pattern as typical for Oxytricha s. str., i. e., with 18 comparatively thick and thus
conspicuous FVT-cirri (Fig. 237a, g, 238d; Table 87). Buccal cirrus at level of anterior end of
endoral membrane; transverse cirri thick, in bowl-like pattern, about 20 µm long and distinctly
projecting from body proper. Marginal cirri about 10 µm long, right marginal row commences at
level of buccal vertex and ends subterminally.
Six rows of dorsal bristles in typical Oxytricha pattern, i. e., three bipolar rows left of midline
of body, rows 1 and 2 each associated with a caudal cirrus, row 1 with a one-bristle-wide gap

posterior of mid-body; row 4 originates by a posterior split of row 3, short, produces third caudal
cirrus; rows 5 and 6 distinctly shortened, originate from right marginal row. Bristles of rows 1–3
anteriorly 3–5 µm long, gradually increase to 10 µm posteriorly; bristles of dorsomarginal rows
4–7 µm long (Fig. 237a, h, 238b); distal region of all bristles with increased protargol affinity,
possibly slightly thickened (Fig. 237h, 238e). Caudal cirri conspicuous because comparatively
thick and about 25 µm long in vivo (Fig. 237a, h, i, 238e; Table 87).
Oral apparatus extends 31–40%, on average 36% of body length in protargol preparations
(Fig. 237a, d, g, 238a, d; Table 87). Adoral zone of ordinary shape and structure, composed of
an average of 20 membranelles with cilia about 15 µm long in frontal membranelles; largest
membranellar bases about 6 µm wide in vivo and 4.2 µm in protargol preparations. Buccal cavity
very narrow and shallow, in three specimens about 2 µm wide in vivo, widens to 4.2 µm on
average in protargol preparations (Table 87); buccal lip narrow, bears paroral membrane with
cilia about 5 µm long in vivo (Fig. 237a). Undulating membranes straight, optically side by side
or one upon the other, paroral distinctly longer than endoral anteriorly. Pharyngeal fibres distinct
in vivo and in protargol preparations, extend posteriorly.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at the moderately saline and circumneutral type
locality. Oxytricha lithofera became numerous three weeks after rewetting the sample, indicating
a k-selected life strategy. Recently found also in Australia.
Remarks: This is a highly distinct species with a combination of features not present in any other
described Oxytricha s. l. (berger 1999, Foissner et al. 2002): Two large lithosomes (unique for
Oxytricha); abutting macronuclear nodules; right marginal cirral row commencing at level of
buccal vertex; dorsal bristles increase in length from about 4 µm anteriorly to 10 µm posteriorly,
their distal end with increased protargol affinity; a one-bristle-wide gap in dorsal kinety 1; and
straight undulating membranes. There are several Oxytricha species which have one or more of
these features, e. g., O. siseris (Fig. 237e, f) redescribed by Foissner (1982) but none has all the
characteristics typical for O. lithofera. The composition and function of the lithosomes is not
known.
Oxytricha pulvillus nov. spec. (Fig. 239a–k, 240a–r, 241a–o; Table 88)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 90 × 35 µm; ellipsoid. 2 almost abutting, broadly ellipsoid
macronuclear nodules and 2 globular micronuclei. Cortical granules in rather narrowly spaced
rows, colourless, about 0.5 µm across. Cirri of ordinary size and length, transverse cirri fringed
distally. 6 rows of dorsal bristles 3–4 µm long; 3 caudal cirri. Adoral zone of membranelles
extends about 38% of body length, composed of an average of 26 membranelles. Buccal cavity
narrow, anterior of cavity a cushion-like convexity seemingly pushing membranellar scutum
right to body`s midline; undulating membranes slightly curved, close together optically crossing
in mid of buccal cavity. Resting cyst with thin, smooth wall and a compact slime layer 3–4 µm
thick. Ontogenesis in typical Oxytricha pattern.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (65), i. e., highly saline (~ 50‰) soil from an abandoned field in
the surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, north coast of Venezuela, Morrocoy National
Park, 67°13’W 11°33’N.
704

Type material: 1 holotype and 5 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Pulvillus (a small cushion) is a Latin noun in apposition, referring to the pillow-like
preoral area.
Description: Most and especially the important features of O. pulvillus have an ordinary
variability (CV ≤ 15%). Of those having a higher coefficient of variation, the distance between

ratio of 2.2:1 in protargol and SEM preparations while of 2.8:1 in vivo (Table 88), showing
a considerable width inflation by the preparation procedures. Body outline elliptic to elongate
elliptic, laterally flattened up to 2:1, ventral side flat, dorsal more or less convex, depending of
nutrition state (Fig. 239a, g, 240a, b, d, e, i–k, m, o, r). Nuclear apparatus in mid-body slightly
left of midline, remarkable because macronuclear nodules only 4 µm apart on average (Fig.
239a, 240p–r, 241b; Table 88). Macronuclear nodules globular to ellipsoid, on average broadly
ellipsoid; many nucleoli up to 2 µm across. One to four globular to broadly ellipsoid micronuclei
attached to or rather distant from macronuclear nodules. Contractile vacuole not recognizable,
very likely due to the high salinity (50‰). Cortex colourless, moderately flexible (~ Sterkiella),
studded with rows of colourless granules only about 0.5 µm across and not staining with methyl
green-pyronin (Fig. 239c, d, f). Cytoplasm colourless or brownish when digesting many fungal
spores, studded with (i) countless weakly refractive granules about 0.7 µm in size; (ii) highly
refractive crystals 2–4 µm in size and with “doubled” ends (Fig. 239e); (iii) starch grains in raw
cultures; (iv) lipid droplets 2–3 µm across; (v) 5–15 µm-sized food vacuoles containing small
colonies of choanoflagellates, fungal spores, and globular inclusions likely from small ciliates
and flagellates (Fig. 239a). Swims and creeps rather slowly.
Ventral cirral pattern as typical for Oxytricha s. str. (berger 1999), i. e., with 18 fronto-ventral-
transverse cirri of ordinary size and length (Fig. 239a, 240a–e, k, l, p–r, 241a; Table 88). Buccal
cirrus subapical of paroral membrane; transverse cirri distinctly projecting from body proper,
fringed distally, 20–25 µm long in vivo. Marginal cirral rows extend to near posterior body end,
cirri composed of two to three rows of basal bodies, about 12 µm long in vivo.

4–5 µm long in vivo and in SEM preparations (Fig. 239i, 240m–o, 241b; Table 88).
Oral apparatus extends to 32–43% of body length, on average 38% in protargol preparations
(Fig. 239a, b, 240a–e, k, l, p–r, 241a; Table 88). Adoral zone of ordinary shape and structure,
composed of an average of 20 membranelles with frontal cilia about 15 µm long and largest bases
about 7 µm wide in vivo. Buccal cavity flat, narrow to very narrow, anterior of cavity a cushion-
like convexity including left half of membranellar scutum, right half hyaline, as usual (Fig. 239a,
b, 240a–c, k). Buccal lip very narrow, bears paroral membrane having 5 µm long cilia in vivo.
Undulating membranes slightly curved, close together optically crossing in or near mid of buccal

Fig. 240p–r. Oxytricha pulvillus, ventral views after fixation with ethanol and protargol impregnation. The rather poor fixation

Resting cyst: Globular with an average diameter of 38 µm (Table 88); smooth and colourless.
Wall composed of two distinct layers, viz., a very hyaline but compact slime (?) envelope 3–4
µm thick and an about 1 µm thick, moderately refractive wall possibly composed of two layers.
Cortex of cell very thin, underlaid by a 2–3 µm thick, finely granular layer followed by a mass
of rather hyaline globules 1–4 µm in size. Macronuclear nodules not fused (Fig. 239h, 240f–h;
Table 88).
Ontogenesis: This is virtually as in Oxytricha granulifera, type of the genus (Foissner & adaM
1983b, berger 1999) except for small differences in the temporal sequence of the processes, e.
g., the production of adoral membranelles occurs slightly later while the postoral cirri develop to
anlagen slightly earlier. Ontogenesis confirms two dorsomarginal kineties and a posterior split of
dorsal kinety 3 to produce kinety 4. Further details, see figure explanations (Fig. 239j, k, 241c–o).

Occurrence and ecology: Oxytricha pulvillus was discovered at Venezuelan site (65), i. e., in a
highly saline (50‰) sample from the north coast. It occurred also at Venezuelan site (47), i. e., in
a slightly saline sample (10‰) from the north coast of the Henri Pittier National Park. This shows
that O. pulvillus is a euryhaline species from which we got raw cultures with artificial sea water
and some squashed wheat grains.

macronuclear nodules fused to a central globular mass. Cirri are formed in the fronto-ventral-transverse anlagen and anlagen
developed in dorsal kineties 1–3. Most of the parental cirri, shown by contour, that did not form anlagen, are still present. i, j:
Late divider with rod-shaped macronuclear mass and divided micronuclei. The fronto-ventral-transverse cirri have been formed
and migrate to their specific sites. The dorsomarginal kineties have been formed (arrows), and the newly generated dorsal kinety

transverse cirri moved to their specific sites and most of the parental ciliature has been resorbed. Dorsal kinety 3 splits into a long
anterior and a short posterior portion (arrowheads). A young post-divider is shown in Figure 239j, k. CC – caudal cirri, FC1 –
frontal cirrus 1, MA – macronuclear mass, MI – micronuclei, OP – oral primordium. Scale bars 30 µm.
713

Remarks: Oxytricha spp. are difficult to identify because many of the old and also some of the
more recent descriptions are very incomplete. We do not use the inconspicuous cortical granules
and the preoral cushion as discriminating features because they are too sophisticated for the old
descriptions. Then, O. pulvillus has seven features not combined in any previous description: (i)
size about 90 × 35 µm; (ii) macronuclear nodules rather close together, each with a micronucleus;
(iii) transverse cirri rather thick and fringed distally; (iv) caudal cirri well recognizable; (v) buccal
cavity narrow; (vi) dorsal bristles not longer than 5 µm; (vii) saline habitat. Using these features,
Oxytricha oxymarina berger, 1999 (formerly O. marina Kahl, 1932) is probably the most
similar species, viz., it is 100–120 µm long, has rather close macronuclear nodules, a narrow
buccal cavity, a saline habitat, and more than three frontal adoral membranelles, a distinct feature
present also in O. pulvillus. There are, however, also some differences that suggest O. pulvillus
as a different species: transverse cirri thin (vs. rather thick and fringed distally), caudal cirri,
although conspicuous, not mentioned by Kahl, and the length:width ratio of the body in vivo
(~3.8:1 vs. 2.8:1). A second similar species is Oxytricha procera Kahl, 1932. However, this
species is much more slender than O. pulvillus (5–6:1 vs. 2.8:1 in vivo) and its transverse cirri are
thin and not fringed (vs. rather thick and fringed).
The following species differ more distinctly from O. pulvillus than O. oxymarina and O. procera
(see berger 1999 for authors and dates): O. kahlovata, O. longa, O. minor, O. similis, O.
parahalophila, and O. tenella.
Notohymena antarctica Foissner, 1996a (Fig. 242a–k, 243a–h; Tables 89, 90)
Material: Over the years, we collected data from six soil populations belonging to four major
biogeographic regions: Antarctica (type locality; holo- and paratype slide deposited in Linz (LI),
reg. no.1997/48, 49); Brazil (material from a termite nest); Australian population 1 (Dinaro dam
in the outskirts of the town of Cairns), two voucher slides deposited in Linz (LI), reg. no. 2000/91,
92; Australian population 2 (dry basin of the Fogg Dam near to the town of Darwin); Austrian
population 1 (Johannser Kogel in the outskirts of the town of Vienna; for detailed site description,
see Foissner et al. 2005), four voucher slides deposited in Linz (LI), reg. no. 2007/634–637;
Austrian population 2 (junction area of the Enns River and the Danube River near to the town
of Linz, Upper Austria; for details, see Foissner 2004), two voucher slides deposited in Linz
(LI), reg. no. 2007/599, 600. Thus, it is possible to evaluate three important features: the cortical
granules, major morphometrics, and the distribution.
Cortical granules (Fig. 242f, h, 243b–d; Table 90): The arrangement, size, and colour of the
cortical granules, likely a kind of extrusomes, are important features in the α-taxonomy of
hypotrichs (Kahl 1932, Foissner 1982, berger 1999). The arrangement and size of the cortical
granules of N. antarctica are little variable while their colour varies from colourless over yellow
to orange (Table 90).
The morphometric and morphological data indicate that the colour differences are not due to
different species. Thus, we conclude that the colour of the cortical granules is a poor feature
in this species, especially when not supported by another “strong” character, for instance, the

number of adoral membranelles.
Morphometric analyses (Table 89): The four populations are highly similar in most morphological
and morphometric features, suggesting conspecificity. The average variability coefficients (CV)
are ≤ 10% for the following important features: body length 76–94 µm, CV 6.7–8.6%; length
of the adoral zone of membranelles 28–34 µm, CV 3.4–11.7%; number of adoral membranelles
28–30, CV 2.6–6.4%; and the number of cirri in the right (17–19, CV 3.4–9%) and left (18–20,
CV 3.7–8%) marginal row. Further, the median is invariable for many features: two macronuclear
nodules, two micronuclei, three frontal cirri, four frontoventral cirri, one buccal cirrus, three
postoral cirri, two pretransverse cirri, five transverse cirri, three caudal cirri, and six dorsal
kineties. However, the Upper Austrian population is rather variable: one to two micronuclei, two
to four frontoventral cirri, four to five transverse cirri, three to five caudal cirri, and 6–7 dorsal
kineties.

Basically, these data confirm those of Foissner (1982) that many morphological and morphometric
characters of the hypotrichs are valuable or very valuable for defining species, especially those
which are countable, such as the number of adoral membranelles, FVT-cirri, caudal cirri, dorsal
kineties, and macronuclear nodules.
Distribution: Except of Africa, N. antarctica has now been recorded from all main biogeographic
regions (Foissner 1996a, 2004; this study). The absence from Africa is surprising because we
made several detailed studies on soil ciliates (Foissner 1999b, Foissner et al. 2002, 2008).
Improved diagnosis (based on four populations, Table 89): Size in vivo about 90–110 × 35–40
µm. 2 ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 2 micronuclei. Cortical granules mainly around bases
of cirri and dorsal bristles; 0.5–1.5 µm in diameter; colourless, yellow or orange. On average
18 FVT-cirri, 17–19 cirri in right marginal row and 18–20 in left row. Usually 6 dorsal kineties
and 3 caudal cirri. Adoral zone extends 33–38% of body length on average, composed of 28–30
membranelles.
Description of Austrian population 1 (Fig. 242a–g, i, 243a, b, f–h; Tables 89, 90): Size in vivo
95–120 × 35–45 µm, usually about 110 × 45 µm, as calculated from some in vivo measurements
and the morphometric data in Table 89 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Length:width ratio
2.4–3.2:1, on average 2.7:1 in vivo and in protargol preparations, body shape thus slenderly
ellipsoid, posterior end occasionally bluntly pointed, ventral margin usually slightly convex,
dorsal margin straight to slightly concave, laterally flattened about 2:1 (Fig. 242a–e, 243a, e–g;
Table 89). Nuclear apparatus in middle third of cell slightly left of body’s midline, composed
of two macronuclear nodules and one to three micronuclei (Fig. 242a, e, 243a, f, g; Table 89).
Macronuclear nodules rather close together, ellipsoid (~ 2:1), contain many small nucleoli.
Micronuclei in deep concavities of or near to macronuclear nodules, especially conspicuous in

Source Description
Antarctica (FOISSNER Arranged in groups around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles; yellow to yellow-green,
1996) give cells yellowish colour at low magnification (≤ ×100); do not impregnate with
protargol.
Brazil (FOISSNER, Arranged in groups around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles, rare on ventral surface; 1–
unpubl.) 1.5 µm in diameter; usually yellowish, rarely almost or entirely colourless.
Australia, population 1 Arranged in groups around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles, on ventral side in loose
(FOISSNER, unpubl.) rows; about 1 µm in diameter; colourless to slightly yellowish (Fig. 242j, k, 243b–e);
do not impregnate with protargol.
Australia, population 2 Occur mainly around the bases of cirri and dorsal bristles; about 1 µm in diameter;
(FOISSNER, unpubl.) citrine, rarely with orange shimmer, give cells a yellowish shimmer; in a further
population orange!
Austria, population 1 Arranged in groups around bases of dorsal bristles plus a loose row between two
(FOISSNER, unpubl.) bristle rows each, loosely arranged on ventral side, not grouped around cirri; 0.4–0.6
µm in diameter; colourless to yellow; stain red and burst with methyl green-pyronin
(Fig. 242a–g, 243a, f–h).
Austria, population 2 Similar to Antarctic population; impregnate with protargol (Fig. 242h).
(FOISSNER, unpubl.)
vivo because about 5 × 3.5 µm in size and strongly refractive (Fig. 243e), as in the Antarctic
type population. Contractile vacuole in or slightly anterior of mid-body, without distinct canals.
Cortex very flexible, colourless to yellowish due to the cortical granules (Table 90). Cytoplasm
colourless, contains food vacuoles and, usually, many crystals (Fig. 242a, b, g, 243a). Food
vacuoles 5–12 µm across in vivo, contain the flagellate Polytoma, naked amoebae, fungal hyphae,
and up to 20 µm long spores of Fusarium. Crystals of usual shape and size, frequently accumulate
in posterior half, forming dark spots under bright field illumination at low magnification (≤ ×100;
Fig. 242b). Glides slowly to rather rapidly on microscope slide, never rests.
Somatic and oral ciliature perfectly oxytrichid and as described in type population (Fig. 242a, d,
e, 243f–h; Table 89). Cirri rather thick, except of last marginal cirri; transverse cirri about 25 µm
long in vivo and thus distinctly projecting from body proper; caudal cirri thin and right of body’s
midline, indistinctly separate from left marginal cirri. Buccal horn and undulating membranes as
conspicuous as in type specimens. Buccal lip broader than in type, thus covering most of buccal
cavity, difficult to recognize because very hyaline (Fig. 242a, b).
Notes on Australian population 1 (Fig. 242j, k, 243c–e; Tables 89, 90). Size in vivo about 100 ×
40 µm; ellipsoid to slenderly ellipsoid, frequently slenderly obovate; about 2:1 flattened laterally.
Micronuclei in vivo conspicuous because about 5 × 4 µm in size and strongly refractive (Fig.
243e). Contractile vacuole in mid-body, with short collecting canals. Cortical granules described
in Table 90. Cytoplasm with crystals and many lipid droplets up to 3 µm across in posterior body
region. Feeds on Polytoma digested in food vacuoles 7–10 µm in diameter and, occasionally, on
small cyanobacteria. Creeps and swims rather rapidly.
Somatic and oral ciliature very similar to that of type population (Table 89). Frontal cirri in vivo ~
15 µm long, marginal cirri ~ 13 µm, transverse cirri ~ 23 µm, caudal cirri ~ 17 µm, dorsal bristles
721

~ 3 µm, bases of largest adoral membranelles ~ 8 µm wide, paroral cilia ~ 10 µm long.
A late divider shows the origin of the thickened anterior end of the paroral membrane from a
minute fork composed of the dikinetal paroral and a short monokinetal row (Fig. 242j, k). This is
possibly different from Notohymena rubescens in which only some dikinetids are added laterally
to the anterior region of the paroral (voss 1991).
Notes on Austrian population 2 (Fig. 242h, 243a, b; Tables 89, 90). The Upper Austrian
specimens have a rather variable 18 FVT-cirral pattern, for instance, three to five caudal cirri
sometimes difficult to distinguish from left marginal cirri (Table 89). Here, we illustrate the
cortical granulation of the ventral side, showing that it is irregular but we cannot exclude that
some granules did not impregnate (Fig. 242h). Granules in protargol preparations much smaller
than in vivo (≤ 0.5 µm vs. ~ 1 µm). Feeds on a medium-sized Peranema and fungal conidia.
Stomatogenesis commences at uppermost transverse cirrus.
Synonymy: The observations from six populations globally show a high variability in an
important species feature, viz., the colour of the cortical granules that varies from colourless to
orange (Table 90). Thus, Notohymena pampasica KüPPers et al., 2007, whose main feature are
the colourless cortical granules, is very likely synonymous with N. antarctica. The synonymy is
emphasized by the highly similar morphometrics.
Notohymena quadrinucleata nov. spec. (Fig. 244a–g, 245a–f; Table 91)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 35 µm; ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid. 4 macronuclear nodules
and 2 micronuclei in line left of body`s midline. Cortical granules yellowish to citrine, 0.7–1
µm across. 18 ordinary fronto-ventral-transverse cirri; right marginal cirral row commences far
subapically. 6 dorsal kineties with 3 µm long bristles, 3 caudal cirri. Adoral zone of membranelles
occupies about 36% of body length, composed of an average of 28 membranelles. Buccal cavity
narrow and deep; buccal horn conspicuous.
Type locality: Site (71), i. e., soil under a Pandanus palm in Santa Cruz Island, Galápagos,
0°37’S 90°21’W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the Latin quantifier quadr (four), the thematic
vowel •i-, and the Latin participle nucleata (having a nucleus). It refers to the four macronuclear
nodules, a main feature of the species.
Description: Notohymena quadrinucleata has a surprisingly low variability, most variation
coefficients being lower than 10% (Table 91).
Size in vivo 80–110 × 30–45 µm, usually about 100 × 35 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
722

measurements and the morphometric data in Table 91 adding 20% and 15% for length and
width shrinkage, respectively, due to ethanol fixation; Columbian specimens in vivo up to 130
µm long and more slender than those from Galápagos (Fig. 245a, b). Body shape inconspicuous,
i. e., ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid or slightly ovate, laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 244a,
b). Nuclear apparatus in central quarters left of cell`s midline (Fig. 244a, g, 245d–f; Table 91).
Invariably four macronuclear nodules in line, rarely in two indistinct pairs, anterior nodule
underneath proximal end of adoral zone of membranelles; studded with ordinary nucleoli.
Usually two globular micronuclei attached to various sites of macronuclear nodules. Contractile
vacuole slightly anterior of mid-body, with two long collecting canals (Fig. 244a). Cortex very
flexible, contains loose rows of yellowish to citrine granules 0.7–1 µm across (Fig. 244c, d).
Cytoplasm with a moderate number of lipid droplets up to 5 µm across and many colourless
crystals scattered throughout postoral body portion, usually forming some aggregates in rear

small ciliates digested in food vacuoles 5–20 µm across. Moves ordinarily, showing pronounced
flexibility when creeping between soil particles.
Ventral cirral pattern as typical for Oxytricha s. str., i. e., with 18 ordinarily-sized fronto-ventral-
transverse cirri (Fig. 244a, f, 245a, b, d, e; Table 91). Frontal cirri about 20 µm long in vivo;
buccal cirrus at level of summit of paroral membrane, i. e., far distant from its anterior end; upper
postoral cirri close together; transverse cirri about 20 µm long in vivo, project distinctly from
body proper because posteriormost cirrus only 4 µm anterior of rear body end. Marginal cirri
about 13 µm long in vivo, right row commences 17 µm distant from anterior body end, distance
between first and second cirrus slightly enlarged; left marginal row extends to body`s midline
posteriorly.

Six dorsal kineties in typical Oxytricha pattern, bristles 3 µm long in vivo (Fig. 244g, 245e; Table
91). Caudal cirri of ordinary thickness, about 20 µm long in vivo, insert in and left of body`s
midline.
Oral apparatus extends 32–46%, on average 36% of body length in protargol preparations (Fig.
244a, f, 245a, b, d, e; Table 91). Adoral zone of ordinary shape and structure, composed of
an average of 28 membranelles with longest bases about 8 µm wide in vivo and 6 µm after
protargol impregnation. Buccal cavity narrow but deep, especially in anterior half; buccal horn
conspicuous, covers part of adoral zone and proceeds as membranellar scutum; buccal lip narrow,
bears paroral membrane with cilia about 8 µm long in vivo, those of endoral 20 µm long and
extending into pharynx. Undulating membranes as typical for genus, paroral and endoral of
similar length, optically intersect at level of mid buccal cavity. Pharynx distinct in vivo and in
protargol preparations due to the long endoral cilia (Fig. 244a, f, 245a, b, d, e; Table 91).

Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in Galápagos (type), Columbia (San Andres Island;
sandy soil covered with grass, palm litter, and banana litter; pH 7.5; not saline; sample kindly
collected by Dr. W. PetZ), and Japan (soil from a rice field in the surroundings of the Lake Biwa
museum). This shows wide, probably cosmopolitan distribution and, possibly, a preference for
immature soil environments.
Remarks: There is only one congener with four macronuclear nodules: Notohymena saprai KaMra
& KuMar, 2010. This species has dark green cortical granules while those of N. quadrinucleata
are yellowish to citrine. Further, N. saprai is twice as long as N. quadrinucleata (149 × 49 µm
vs. 78 × 33 µm in protargol preparations). See berger (1999) and lv et al. (2013) for overviews
of the species described.

Fragmospina nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Semirigid Oxytrichidae ehrenberg, 1838 with 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri in
Oxytricha pattern. Third postoral cirrus not involved in anlagen formation. 1 right and 1 left
row of marginal cirri. 6 dorsal kineties, kinety 4 originates by a split of kinety 3. Buccal cavity
moderately wide and deep, Cyrtohymena-like in vivo. Undulating membranes distinctly curved,
but not recurved, i. e., in Australocirrus pattern. Resting cyst with conspicuous spines.
Type species: Steinia candens depressa gellért, 1942.
Etymology: Fragmospina is composed of the Latin nouns fragmentum (piece broken off) and
spina (thorn), referring to the fragmentation of dorsal kinety 3 and the spinous resting cyst.
Feminine gender.
Remarks: See berger (1999) for all species and authors mentioned. gellért (1942) stated that
his population is a variety of Steinia candens and provided a precise diagnosis and description.
Foissner (1989) transferred it to Cyrtohymena: C. candens var. depressa (gellért, 1942)
Foissner, 1989. berger (1999), in contrast, supported synonymy with C. inquieta because C.
depressa is less than 150 µm long and “it is impossible to separate it reliably from C. inquieta
or C. candens”. However, on page 317, berger (1999) states: “Synonymy with C. inquieta is
uncertain because the full set (3) of postoral ventral cirri is present”.
727

We know C. depressa since years and from soils globally. It is not a very rare species because it is
present in seven out of the 71 neotropis samples (see species list). Our reinvestigation shows that
C. depressa is not only a “good” species but also the representative of a new genus: Fragmospina.
Fragmospina is characterized by a combination of four features (Fig. 246a–d, g, 247a–f): 18 FVT-
cirri, dorsal kinety 4 originates by a split of kinety 3, undulating membranes in Australocirrus
pattern, and a spinous resting cyst. 18 FVT-cirri and a split of dorsal kinety 3 characterize
Oxytricha s. str. while Australocirrus spp. have multiple fragmentation of kinety 3 (berger 1999,
Foissner et al. 2005a, KuMar & Foissner 2015). The shape and arrangement of the undulating
membranes match Australocirrus while the paroral membrane of Cyrtohymena recurves distally
(KuMar & Foissner 2015), and that of Oxytricha never touches the adoral zone of membranelles
(berger 1999, KuMar & Foissner 2015). The spinous resting cyst is of particular importance.
Spinous cysts are rather common in stylonychine oxytrichids while those of Australocirrus spp.
lack spines but have special crystals between ectocyst and mesocyst (berger 1999, Foissner et
al. 2005a, KuMar & Foissner 2015).
Fragmospina depressa (gellért, 1942) nov. comb., nov. stat. (Fig. 246a–h, 247a–
f; Table 92)
Improved diagnosis (based on three populations): Size in vivo about 100 × 40 µm; ellipsoid to
broadly ellipsoid. 2 macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. About 19 and 17 cirri in right
and left marginal row, respectively. Dorsal kinety 4 extends to mid-body; 3 caudal cirri. Adoral
zone extends about 27–30% of body length, composed of approximately 30 membranelles.
Type locality: Algal film on tree bark in the surroundings of the town of Kolozsvár (Klausenburg),
Hungary (now Rumania), 23°E 47°N.
Material investigated and deposited: 4 and 2 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated
specimens from Rwanda and Venezuelan site (56), respectively, have been deposited in the
Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in the original description. Possibly, the epithet refers to the deepened
buccal cavity.
Redescription: The morphometric data on the Rwandan and the Venezuelan population match
almost perfectly, in spite of the large spatial distance, showing not only conspecificity but also the
value of such analyses (Table 92).
Length 100–120 µm, according to gellért (1942); specimens from Rwanda and Venezuela in vivo
80–115 × 30–50 µm, usually about 100 × 40 µm, as calculated from some in vivo measurements
and the morphometric data in Table 92 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body shape highly
similar in the three populations, i. e., ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid (2–3:1), rarely quadrangular
with rounded ends or elongate obovate; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 246a, b, d–f, h,
247d, e). Nuclear apparatus in central quarters slightly left of body´s midline (Fig. 246a, c, h,

247a, d–f; Table 92). Macronuclear nodules slenderly to broadly ellipsoid, on average ellipsoid,
about 20 × 10 µm in vivo; nucleoli numerous, up to 2 µm across. Usually one micronucleus near
or attached to each macronuclear nodule, rarely three or four micronuclei; individual micronuclei
globular to broadly ellipsoid, on average 2 µm in protargol preparations, in vivo about 4 × 3 µm.
Contractile vacuole in or slightly anterior of mid-body at left margin of cell, with short collecting
canals (Fig. 246a). Cortex semirigid, becomes flexible under slightest coverslip pressure; specific
cortical granules absent. Cytoplasm colourless, studded with various inclusions, such as lipid
droplets up to 10 µm across, ordinary crystals 2–5 µm in size, and many food vacuoles containing
pieces of filamentous cyanobacteria, ordinary bacteria, green algae about 15 × 9 µm in size,
heterotrophic flagellates, and middle-sized ciliates (Protocyclidium terricola, Colpoda maupasi)
digested in food vacuoles up to 30 µm across (Fig. 246a). Swims and glides rather rapidly.
18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri in Oxytricha pattern (for a review, see berger 1999; Fig. 246a,
b, h, 247a, b, d, e; Table 92). Marginal cirri about 15 µm long, left marginal row posteriorly
slightly longer than right (Table 92). Transverse cirri inconspicuously thickened, about 20 µm
long in vivo and thus distinctly projecting from body proper. Caudal cirri right of body´s midline,
fine, beat lively, about 20 µm long in vivo. Dorsal bristles 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in six rows
(Fig. 246c, 247f; Table 92): rows 1–3 almost bipolar; row 4 short, does not extend beyond mid-
body; rows 5 and 6 dorsomarginal, row 5 slightly shortened posteriorly, row 6 very short, does
not extend beyond first third of cell.

Adoral zone of oxytrichid shape and structure, extends approximately 1/3 of body length,
composed of 29 membranelles on average (Fig. 246a, b, h, 247a, b, d, e; Table 92). Largest
membranellar bases about 9 µm wide in vivo and 7 µm in protargol preparations. Buccal cavity of
ordinary width but rather deep, anterior margin in vivo semicircularly curved, forming a distinct
buccal horn (Fig. 246a). Buccal lip about 4 µm wide, covers proximal portion of adoral zone (Fig.
246a, d, f, h). Paroral membrane composed of zigzagging basal bodies, cilia about 10 µm long
in vivo, in protargol preparations distinctly curved but never recurved, extends to left anterior
corner of cell almost touching adoral zone. Endoral membrane curved, optically intersects paroral
in mid-buccal cavity. Pharyngeal fibres inconspicuous, extend obliquely backwards (Fig. 246a, b,
d, f, h, 247a, b, d, e; Table 92).
Resting cyst: The resting cysts of F. depressa are colourless and approximately 50 µm in diameter
(Fig. 246g, 247c). The cyst wall is about 5 µm thick, yellowish, and studded with conical spines
3–5 µm long. The cyst contents is bipartite: the peripheral third is finely granular, the central area
contains many lipid droplets up to 5 µm across and the very likely fused macronuclear nodules.
Ontogenesis: Some dividers showed that an anarchic field of basal bodies originates from the
transverse and postoral cirri. The last postoral cirrus is not involved in anlagen formation.
Occurrence and ecology: Fragmospina depressa has been recorded from all main biogeographic
regions (usually as Cyrtohymena candens depressa), except of Antarctica (Foissner 1998). It is
rather frequent inhabiting a great variety of habitats (see species list). In Rwanda, we found it in
a mixture of surface soil and moss from large stones on the coast of the Kibuye Lake, 29°40’E
2°26’S. The type locality is in Rumania, where gellért (1942) discovered F. depressa in the
algal film of tree bark.
Remarks: In protargol preparations, F. depressa is fairly easily recognizable by the special pattern
of the paroral membrane described in the diagnosis of the genus, the distinctly shortened dorsal
kinety 4, and the moderate body size (~ 100 × 40 µm). In vivo, the identification is difficult,
although we usually recognize the species as a “Cyrtohymena candens with narrow buccal
cavity” (Table 92). Beginners should check the identification in protargol preparations because
F. depressa is easily confused with Notohymena spp., Cyrtohymena spp., Oxytricha spp., and
certain populations of Sterkiella histriomuscorum.
Paroxytricha nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Flexible oxytrichids with 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri. Dorsal kinety 3 produces
kinety 4 during ontogenesis. 2 or more macronuclear nodules and micronuclei. Resting cyst with
separate macronuclear nodules and onion tower-shaped lepidosomes (scales) on surface.
Type species: Paroxytricha quadrinucleata nov. spec.
Etymology: Paroxytricha is a composite of the Latin prefix para (like, equal) and the Greek
generic name Oxytricha (with sharp hairs = cirri), referring to the similarity with Oxytricha.
Feminine gender.

Species assignable: According to our unpublished observations two further species fit the diagnosis:
Paroxytricha ottowi (Foissner, 1997) nov. comb. (basionym: Oxytricha ottowi Foissner, 1997)
and Paroxytricha longigranulosa (berger & Foissner, 1989) nov. comb. (basionym: Oxytricha
longigranulosa berger & Foissner, 1989).
Remarks: When we discovered the species mentioned above, we supposed that they were close
relatives of Oxytricha granulifera Foissner & AdaM, 1983b because they differ morphologically
only by the number of macronuclear nodules (four and eight vs. two) and the shape of the cortical
granules (rod-like vs. globular). It was thus a surprise when the small subunit (SSU) rRNA placed
O. longigranulosa in a distinct clade different from O. granulifera (sChMidt et al. 2007). This
motivated us to look at the resting cysts. Oxytricha granulifera, type of the genus, has globular
lepidosomes on the cyst surface (Foissner et al. 2007) while that of the three Paroxytricha species
are onion tower-shaped (Fig. 248k, l, 249o–s). The fine structure, in contrast, is rather similar
(Foissner et al. 2007 and unpubl.). A further difference concerns the macronuclear nodules:
they fuse in the cyst of Oxytricha granulifera (berger 1999) but remain separate in the three
Paroxytricha species (Fig. 248k; Foissner unpubl.). Taking into account the differences in cyst
morphology and molecular sequences, a distinct genus appears appropriate.
Paroxytricha quadrinucleata nov. spec. (Fig. 248a–n, 249a–s; Table 93)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 40 µm; ellipsoid. 4 broadly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules.
Cortical granules in dense rows, colourless, rod-shaped, in vivo about 2 × 0.3 µm in size. Somatic
and oral infraciliature in typical Oxytricha pattern. Resting cyst globular, lepidosomes 2–4 µm
high.
Type locality: In tanks of Tillandsia heterophylla (Bromeliaceae) from a cloud mountain forest
(1460 m above sea level) in Mexico, Veracruz province, surroundings of the town of Jalapa
(Xalapa), 19°32’51’’N 96°57’36’’W.
Type material: The description and the type material are from pure cultures with tap water and
some cracked wheat kernels for bacterial growth. The protargol slides have been deposited in
the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Unfortunately, the holotype and
the paratype slide bleached almost completely for unknown reasons. Thus, we added 3 paratype
slides with unbleached specimens from the same preparation series.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Latin numeral quadr- (four) and the Latin adjective
nucleatus (with a nucleus), referring to the main feature of the species.
Description: Ordinarily variable, i. e., most and all important features with a CV ≤ 15% (Table
93).
Size highly variable, likely mainly depending on culture conditions; average in vivo sizes between
80 × 30 µm and 110 × 40 µm observed in various culture dishes. Adding 15% preparation
shrinkage, an in vivo size of 70–90 µm × 30–43 µm (mean: 80 × 35 µm) results for the culture

a Anterior body end to proximal end of zone.
b Distance between centre of paroral membrane and right margin of adoral zone.
globular to ellipsoid, on average broadly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules with distinct nucleoli;
anterior nodule usually underneath proximal region of adoral zone of membranelles; nodules
frequently in two rather distinct pairs. One to seven, usually three to four globular micronuclei
near or attached to macronuclear nodules. Contractile vacuole slightly anterior of mid-body,
without collecting canals (Fig. 248a, 249a). Cortex and cell very flexible. Cortical granules in
more or less dense rows, absent along marginal cirral rows, colourless, in vivo about 2 × 0.3 µm
forming a rather distinct fringe; with bright central canal and minute concavity on anterior end;
extruded when methyl green-pyronin is added, becoming up to 5 µm long rods or funnels (Fig.
248a, c–e, 249b, d, h–k); in the SEM ellipsoid or oblong with conical anterior region (Fig. 248j,
249g, l). Cytoplasm colourless, in cultures opaque because studded with countless minute lipid
droplets and food vacuoles with bacteria, flagellate cysts, and corroded starch grains (Fig. 248a,
249a, b, d–f, i). Movement without peculiarities.
Somatic and oral infraciliature as in typical oxytrichids, e. g., as in Oxytricha granulifera, type
of the genus (berger 1999). Thus, the Figures, the detailed morphometry, and some notes
should suffice (Fig. 248a, f, g, 249b, c, m, n; Table 93). Marginal cirri in vivo about 12 µm long,
transverse cirri 20–25 µm and thus distinctly projecting from body proper. Buccal cavity in vivo
4–5 µm wide and flat; paroral cilia about 5 µm long in vivo. Dorsal kinety 3 produces kinety 4
by a subterminal split (Fig. 248n).
Resting cyst (Fig. 248k, l, 249o–s; Table 93): Globular to slightly ellipsoid, in vivo 30 × 27
µm on average. Cyst wall compact but only about 1 µm thick, covered by a 2–3 µm slime
layer containing bacteria and many lepidosomes 2–4 µm high and staining pink with methyl
green-pyronin; lepidosomes not recognizable in the scanning electron microscope because
embedded in slime. Cyst studded with minute lipid (?) droplets, autophagous vacuoles, and the
four macronuclear nodules.
Occurrence and ecology: Common in Central and South America because found in Mexico,
Jamaica, Venezuela, Brazil, and Chile. Likely prefers semiterrestrial habitats, such as tank
bromeliads and floodplain soils.
Remarks: Paroxytricha quadrinucleata is highly similar to only one species, viz., Oxytricha
islandica which has similar shape and size and four macronuclear nodules but lacks cortical
granules and has only four dorsal kineties (berger 1999).
741

Paroxytricha longigranulosa (BerGer & Foissner, 1989) nov. comb. (Fig. 252c,
d; Table 95)
Improved diagnosis: Size in vivo about 90 × 35 µm, 170 × 55 µm or 80 × 25 µm. Ellipsoid to
elongate ellipsoid. 2 narrowly or widely spaced, ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 2 broadly
ellipsoid micronuclei. Cortical granules arranged in loose rows, elongate ellipsoid or ellipsoid,
colourless. Cirral pattern oxytrichid; buccal cirrus right or slightly anterior of distal end of paroral
membrane; 4 or 5 transverse cirri on average 7%, 10% or 4% distant from posterior body end;
right marginal row composed of 24, 37 or 17 cirri on average. Dorsal kinety pattern very likely
as in typical Oxytricha species; 3 caudal cirri. Buccal cavity narrow and shallow. Adoral zone
extends about 33% or 37% of body length, composed of an average of 24, 40 or 21 membranelles
with largest bases 5–7 µm width. Undulating membranes side by side, paroral about 8% or 15%
distant from anterior body end.
Remarks: See berger (1999), berger & Foissner (1989), and blatterer & Foissner (1988)
for descriptions of this species. We split P. longigranulosa into three subspecies based on the
investigation of new populations from China and Venezuela.

Improved diagnosis: Size in vivo about 95 × 35 µm; ellipsoid. Macronuclear nodules widely
spaced. Cortical granules elongate ellipsoid. 5 transverse cirri about 7% distant from posterior
body end; right marginal row composed of 24 cirri on average. Adoral zone extends about 33%
of body length, composed of an average of 24 membranelles with largest bases about 6 µm width.
Paroral membrane about 8% distant from anterior body end.
Paroxytricha longigranulosa sinensis nov. sspec. (Fig. 250a–i, 251a, b; Tables 94,

Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 170 × 55 µm; elongate ellipsoid or slightly obovate. Macronuclear
nodules widely spaced. 5 transverse cirri about 10% distant from posterior body end; right marginal
row composed of 37 cirri on average. Adoral zone extends about 33% of body length, composed
of an average of 40 membranelles with largest bases about 7 µm wide. Paroral membrane about
15% distant from anterior body end.
Type locality: Litter and mud/soil from a dry river drain in the surroundings of the Wei Ming
hotel, outskirts of the town of Beijing, China, 116°E 39°N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective sinensis (belonging to China) refers to the country the species
was discovered.

important feature. The cytoplasm contains pieces of fungal hyphae and fungal spores (FU). LM – left marginal cirral row, MA –
macronuclear nodules, MI – micronucleus, RM – right marginal cirral row, TC – transverse cirri. Scale bars 10 µm.
Description: The protargol preparations are rather poor because the species is fragile and the
cortical granules impregnate deeply, making the analysis of the dorsal ciliature almost impossible.
There is indication that most of the largest specimens even disintegrated. Later and in another
species of this constitution, we recognized that ethanol (~ 70%) stabilizes the cells properly and
provides clear impregnations.
The insufficient fixation is very likely partially responsible for the high coefficients of variation
(> 15%, Table 94), for instance, the width of the buccal cavity (36%), the distance of the posterior
body end to the transverse cirri (20%), and the distance of the posterior body end to the right
marginal cirral row (45%).
Size in vivo 145–185 × 35–75 µm, usually about 170 × 55 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 94 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
shape inconspicuous, usually elongate ellipsoid, rarely ellipsoid or slightly elongate obovate;
laterally flattened up to 2:1, ventral side flat, dorsal convex (Fig. 250a–d, g). Nuclear apparatus
in middle third and left of midline of cell (Fig. 250a, f). Macronuclear nodules widely separate,
anterior nodule in proximal region of adoral zone of membranelles, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid,

on average 20 × 10 µm in protargol preparations; studded with small nucleoli. Usually, two
globular to broadly ellipsoid micronuclei one each attached to macronuclear nodules. Contractile
vacuole slightly anterior to mid-body, with two long collecting canals (Fig. 250a). Cortex very
flexible and thin, underlain by a dense layer of mitochondria 2–3 µm long; loose rows of cortical
granules between pellicle and mitochondrial layer (Fig. 250h, i, 251a, b); individual granules about
1.5 × 0.8 µm in size, colourless or with a yellowish shimmer, stain reddish with methylgreen-
pyronin and deeply with protargol; difficult to recognize in vivo. Cytoplasm colourless, specimens
however brownish under low magnification (≤ × 100) because crammed with (i) up to 20 brown
pieces and spores of fungi, (ii) many food vacuoles only 3–5 µm across and containing bacteria,
(iii) some up to 10 µm-sized globular and irregular lipid droplets, and (iv) rather many crystals
1–3 µm in size (Fig. 250a). Feeds mainly on bacteria, but fungi, flagellates, and ciliates (Halteria
grandinella) occur also in the food vacuoles (Fig. 250a). Swims and creeps rather slowly.

Ventral cirral pattern as in Oxytricha, specifically, cirrus III/2 slightly anterior of cirrus IV/3 (Fig.
250c, e). Buccal cirrus on average 2 µm anterior of paroral membrane, rarely right of anterior
end or some µm posterior of paroral. Frontal and transverse cirri slightly enlarged, the latter on
average 10% (15 µm) distant from posterior body end and thus only slightly projecting from body
proper. Marginal cirri about 17 µm long in vivo, their size gradually and distinctly decreasing
near posterior end of rows (Fig. 250a–e; Table 95).
Dorsal bristles 3–4 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations. Very likely arranged in
Oxytricha pattern (Fig. 250f). Two dividers show two dorsomarginal kineties and one divider
suggest split of kinety 3. Three thin caudal cirri slightly right of body´s midline, about 20 µm long
and thus in vivo difficult to distinguish from marginal cirri.
Adoral zone of membranelles indistinctly gonostomoid and with membranellar bases only 6–7
µm width (13% of body width), i. e., small compared to body size producing a narrow stripe,
especially in large specimens and compared to P. longigranulosa longigranulosa (cp. Fig. 250b–d
with Fig. 252c); extends to 34% of body length and is composed of 39 membranelles on average

(Fig. 250a–d; Table 94). Buccal cavity rather narrow and flat. Paroral and endoral membrane
slightly staggered and side by side (± Stylonychia pattern), unusually short (12%) compared to
body length because commencing 21 µm (= 58% of length of adoral zone) subapically. Paroral
membrane usually slightly convex, endoral indistinctly concave (Fig. 250b–e; Table 94).
Remarks: In this sample occurred both, Paroxytricha longigranulosa longigranulosa and
Paroxytricha longigranulosa sinensis. Thus, we selected for specimens longer than 120 µm,
based on the Japanese type population which reaches around 100 µm in protargol preparations
748

and up to 135 µm in vivo (Table 95). We realize that this is a dangerous method because there
is no gap between the size-classes and no indication of macrostomy. On the other hand, mixing
all specimens would result in extreme variability, for instance, 65–161 µm body length and,
especially, 20–45 adoral membranelles (Table 95) while the width of the membranellar bases (7
µm) is similar to that of P. longigranulosa longigranulosa. These data are in favour of classifying
the large specimens as a distinct species; however, subspecies rank is possibly more appropriate
considering the artificial size separation. The small specimens agree well with P. longigranulosa
longigranulosa.
Paroxytricha longigranulosa sinensis is easily confused with Urosoma gigantea (for a review,
see berger 1999). Indeed, these species are almost inseparable in vivo, differing by the shape of
the cortical granules (ellipsoid vs. globular) and the less subterminally arranged transverse cirri.
In protargol preparations, they can be separated by the cirral pattern (oxytrichid vs. urosomoid)
and the dorsal infraciliature (six vs. four kineties).
Paroxytricha longigranulosa imperfecta nov. sspec. (Fig. 252a, b, 253a–g; Tables
94, 95)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 80 × 25 µm, ellipsoid. Macronuclear nodules narrowly spaced. 4
transverse cirri about 4% distant from posterior body end; right marginal row composed of 17
cirri on average. Adoral zone extends about 37% of body length, composed of an average of 21
membranelles with largest bases about 5 µm width. Paroral membrane about 8% distant from
anterior body end.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (14), i. e., highly fertile field (Mahadja) soil from the outskirts of
Pto. Ayacucho, 67°36’W 5°41’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 1 paratype slide with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and
other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective imperfecta (incomplete) refers to the missing fifth transverse
cirrus.
Description and Remarks: Paroxytricha longigranulosa imperfecta is most similar to the
nominal subspecies differing mainly by the number (4 vs. 5) and location (3.6% vs. 7–8% distant
from rear body end) of the transverse cirri (Tables 94, 95), an important feature in oxytrichid
hypotrichs (berger 1999). A feature not used in the diagnosis, but presumably important, is the
V-like spread of the anterior half of the undulating membranes (Fig. 252b).
This small ciliate is difficult to identify the most important feature being the ellipsoid cortical
granules guiding to Paroxytricha longigranulosa and the four transverse cirri characterizing the
subspecies imperfecta. Very similar species are Oxytricha lanceolata, which lacks cortical granules
and has five transverse cirri, and O. granulifera quadricirrata which has, like P. longigranulosa
imperfecta four transverse cirri but globular cortical granules (for a review, see berger 1999).

750

Both, Paroxytricha longigranulosa imperfecta and Oxytricha granulifera quadricirrata possibly
belong to the Urosomoidae because they have only four transverse cirri. Possibly, sequence data
can clear the matter.
Monomicrocaryon nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Flexible Oxytrichidae with 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri and two macronuclear
nodules with a micronucleus in between. Usually 5 dorsal kineties and 3 caudal cirri; kinety 4
originates by a split of kinety 3.
Type species: Monomicrocaryon granulatum nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek numeral mono (one), the adjective mikros (small), and
the noun karyon (nucleus), referring to the single micronucleus characteristic for this type of
oxytrichids. Neuter gender.
Remarks: berger (1999) recognized 54 Oxytricha species. Some have been described recently,
increasing the number to 57 (Foissner 1999b, Foissner et al. 2008a). Of these, 15 have the
specific nuclear pattern described in the diagnosis of the genus while the others have at least two
micronuclei and 2, 4 or 8 macronuclear nodules (berger 1999). We assume that the specific nuclear
pattern of Monomicrocaryon is usually based on a common ancestor (but see → Quadristicha),
and thus we separate these species at genus level. The nuclear pattern has been used in several
groups of ciliates as a generic or subgeneric character, for instance, in Blepharisma (hirshField
et al. 1973) and dileptids (VďaČný & Foissner 2012).

Monomicrocaryon granulatum nov. spec. (Fig. 254a–e, 255a–g; Table 96)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 70 × 25 µm; ellipsoid to slenderly ellipsoid. Cortical granules in
loose rows, colourless, 0.5–1 µm across. Transverse cirri thick and protruding from body proper;
buccal cirrus near anterior end of paroral. 6 dorsal bristle rows, rows 1, 2, and 4 bipolar; bristles
about 7 µm long, last bristle of rows 1, 2, and 4 elongated to 10–15 µm. Three caudal cirri left
of body´s midline, 20–25 µm long. Adoral zone extends about 33% of body length, composed
of an average of 21 ordinary membranelles. Buccal cavity flat and narrow. Paroral and endoral
membrane one upon the other.
Type locality: Upper soil layer of the rainforest in the Henri Pittier National Park, north coast of
Venezuela, 67°37’W 10°30’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

Etymology: The Latin adjective granulatus refers to the cortical granules, a main feature of this
species.
Description: Size in vivo 60–90 × 20–30 µm, usually about 70 × 25 µm, as calculated from some
live measurements and the data in Table 96 adding 15% preparation shrinkage; not contractile but
very flexible. Shape inconspicuous, i. e., ellipsoid to slenderly ellipsoid, thus easily confused with
a variety of middle-sized oxytrichids, such as Urosomoida spp. and Oxytricha spp. (Fig. 254a,
b, e, 255a–d; Table 96). Nuclear apparatus on average in mid-body and left of body´s midline,
consists of two macronuclear nodules and a micronucleus in between (Fig. 254a, d, 255a–d;
Table 96). Macronuclear nodules ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid, on average 12 × 6 µm in protargol
preparations and in vivo; nucleoli 0.5–2 µm across. Micronucleus about 3 µm across in vivo, in
one specimen attached to mid of anterior macronuclear nodule. Contractile vacuole on average
in mid of left body margin (Fig. 254a, d; Table 96). Cortical granules in loose rows, colourless,
0.5–1 µm across, do not stain with methyl green-pyronin and protargol (Fig. 254c). Cytoplasm
colourless, rear portion frequently dark at low magnification (≤ × 100) because studded with
lipid droplets and crystals 2–4 µm in size. Food vacuoles 5–8 µm across, 20 × 12 µm and with
various inclusions in a protargol-impregnated specimen. Feeds on various, up to 30 µm long
fungal spores (Fig. 254a, 255c), flagellates (Anisonema, Polytoma), and naked amoebae (Fig.
254a). Glides rapidly on microscope slide jumping when changing direction.
Cirral pattern oxytrichid, i. e., usually 18 cirri (berger 1999): three frontal cirri, four frontoventral
cirri, one buccal cirrus, three postoral cirri, two pretransverse cirri, and five thick transverse cirri
about 20 µm long. Right marginal cirral row commences far posteriorly of anterior body end, viz.,
at level of mid-buccal cavity, cirri composed of three kineties with about 13 µm long cilia. Left
marginal row extends to body´s midline posteriorly, cirral bases slightly longer than those of right
row but composed of only two kineties (Fig. 254a, b, 255a–c, e, g; Table 96). Transverse cirri, last
marginal cirri, and caudal cirri produce conspicuous tuft around posterior end of cell (Fig. 254a).
Six dorsal bristle rows in oxytrichid pattern (Fig. 254a, d, e, 255d; Table 96). Rows 1 and 2
bipolar; row 3 slightly shortened posteriorly and with or without some scattered kinetids guiding
to row 4 composed of only a few dikinetids; row 5 extends beyond mid-body; row 6 composed
of an average of four dikinetids. Bristles conspicuous because 7–8 µm long, last bristle of rows
1, 2, and 4 close to caudal cirri and up to 15 µm long. Caudal cirri right of body´s midline filling
gap between ends of marginal cirral rows, conspicuous because up to 30 µm long, usually about
22 µm (Fig. 254a, d, e, 255c, d, g; Table 96).
Oral apparatus extends 33% of body length (Fig. 254a, b, 255a–c, e, f; Table 96). Adoral zone of
ordinary shape, composed of an average of 21 membranelles of usual structure and cilia up to 15
µm long; largest membranellar bases about 5 µm width. Buccal cavity flat and narrow, in vivo
about 4 µm width, anterior and right margin thickened (Fig. 254a). Paroral and endoral membrane
one upon the other when viewed frontally, paroral composed of oblique dikinetids, anteriorly
about 3 µm longer than endoral composed of monokinetids, both usually ending slightly anterior
of buccal vertex; paroral with a short, fibrillar process anteriorly. Pharyngeal fibres ordinary (Fig.
254b, 255b, f).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., a litter and soil sample from
along the nature trail of Rancho Grande. The abundance was moderate in the non-flooded Petri
dish culture.

Remarks: As mentioned above, the genus Monomicrocaryon contains 16 species, of which seven
have long dorsal bristles, as has M. granulatum. Of these, → M. euglenivorum (Kahl, 1932) is
highly similar to M. granulatum, except for the absence of cortical granules. All other species
with long dorsal bristles differ from M. granulatum not only by the absence of cortical granules
but also in other important features. Monomicrocaryon balladyna and M. opisthomuscorum have,
inter alia, dorsal bristle row 4 distinctly shortened anteriorly. Interestingly, row 4 has a short break
in M. granulatum in that area the row ends in M. balladyna and M. opisthomuscorum, indicating
that the shortened state is apomorphic. Monomicrocaryon crassistilatum is considerably larger
than M. granulatum (90–150 µm vs. 60–90 µm). Monomicrocaryon kahlovatum differs from
M. granulatum by body shape (ovate vs. ellipsoidal) and the location of the transverse cirri (far
subterminal so that they do not protrude from body proper vs. subterminal and protruding).
Quadristicha setigera differs from M. granulatum by the location of the buccal cirrus (near
posterior vs. anterior end of paroral membrane). Monomicrocaryon sphagni differs from M.
granulatum by body shape (length:width ratio ~5:1 vs. 2.7:1) and the 15 µm long dorsal bristles
(vs. 8 µm, except of three 15 µm long bristles at end of rows 1, 2 and 4).
Monomicrocaryon euglenivorum (Kahl, 1932) nov. comb.
Improved diagnosis: Size in vivo about 80–90 µm x 30–45 µm or 50–70 x 20–30 µm. Shape
lenticular to ovoid or ellipsoid to slenderly ellipsoid. Buccal cirrus near anterior end of paroral
membrane; transverse cirri acicular or rod-shaped with fringed distal end; right marginal row
commences anterior or at level of buccal vertex; caudal cirri in mid of posterior end or left of
body’s midline. 5 dorsal kineties, bristles 7–10 µm long, posteriorly up to 15 µm; 3 caudal cirri.
Adoral zone about one third of body length, composed of about 18 membranelles.
Remarks: The diagnosis is based on Kahl (1932) and the present investigations. We split M.
euglenivorum into two subspecies because of distinct differences in some morphometrics and the
fringed (vs. acicular) transverse cirri, a feature already used by Xin-bai & aMMerMann (2004)
to distinguish Stylonychia ammermanni from S. harbinensis. borror (1972) synonymized M.
euglenivorum with M. crassistilatum and M. opisthomuscorum; however, we agree with berger
(1999), who follows Kahl (1932), considering them as valid species.
Monomicrocaryon euglenivorum euglenivorum (Kahl, 1932) nov. stat. (Fig.
256d)
Improved diagnosis: Size in vivo about 80–90 µm x 30–45 µm. Shape lenticular, ovoid when
well-fed. Transverse cirri acicular; right marginal row commences anterior to buccal vertex;
caudal cirri in body’s midline.
Type locality: Not given in original description, very likely in Germany near to the town of
Hamburg.
Descriptions: Kahl (1932) and berger (1999).

Monomicrocaryon euglenivorum fimbricirratum Foissner & liebetreu nov.
sspec. (Fig. 256a–c, e–i, 257a–g; Table 97)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo 50–70 x 20–30 µm. Shape ellipsoid to slenderly ellipsoid. Transverse
cirri rod-shaped with fringed distal end; right marginal row commences at level of buccal vertex;
caudal cirri right of body’s midline. 5 dorsal bristle rows; row 1 with a one-kinetid-wide gap
posterior to mid-body; row 4 distinctly shortened anteriorly; row 5 dorsomarginal, extends to
mid-body.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (1), i. e., upper soil layer from the Orinoco floodplain at the village
of Cabruta, Venezuela, 7°38’N 66°14’W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have

been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun fimbria (fringe) and the Latin adjective cirratum (cirri
bearing), referring to the fringed ends of the transverse cirri.
Description: The species was rather rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture but grew well in a
semi-pure culture fed with some squashed wheat grains. The description is based on this material.
Size in vivo 50–70 x 20–30 µm, usually about 60 x 25 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 97 adding 15% preparation shrinkage.
Very flexible, slightly contractile in oral portion. Body length:width ratio in vivo 2.2–3:1,
after protargol impregnation stouter, viz., 1.7–2.4, very likely due to some inflation during the
preparation procedures (Fig. 256a, b, 257a, d, f; Table 97). Shape inconspicuous, i. e., ellipsoid
to slenderly ellipsoid (Fig. 256a, f, 257a), thus easily confused with a variety of moderately
small oxytrichids, such as Monomicrocaryon spp., Oxytricha spp., and Urosomoida spp. Hardly
flattened laterally (Fig. 256e). Nuclear apparatus on average in mid-body and left of body’s
midline, anterior macronuclear nodule commences near level of buccal vertex (Fig. 256a, c,
257b, d, f; Table 97). Macronuclear nodules globular to broadly ellipsoid, on average 8 x 7 µm
in protargol preparations; nucleoli 0.5–1 µm across. One out of 28 specimens with cordiform
anterior macronuclear nodule; six out of 28 cells with a single, large, ellipsoid to reniform or
dumbbell-shaped macronucleus about 15 x 7 µm in size. Micronucleus between macronuclear
nodules, about 2 µm across after protargol impregnation; in one specimen attached to anterior half
of anterior macronuclear nodule, in another to posterior half of posterior nodule; two specimens
with two micronuclei: in one cell attached to anterior and posterior end of macronuclear nodules,
respectively; in the other both left of the abutting macronuclear nodules. Contractile vacuole
in or near mid-body at left cell margin, with inconspicuous collecting canals (Fig. 256a, 257b).
No cortical granules. Cytoplasm colourless, studded with refractive (lipid?) granules 1–1.5 µm
across; with or without cubic crystals 2–3 µm in size, make rear portion dark (refractive) at
low magnification when numerous. Food vacuoles in vivo 6–12 µm across, contain flagellates
(Polytoma), bacterial spores, indeterminable pale matter, and wheat starch grains when cultivated
(Fig. 256a, f, g, 257b). Glides very rapidly on microscope slide, jumps after short resting periods
and when changing direction.
Cirral pattern oxytrichid, i. e., usually 18 cirri (berger 1999) most about 15 µm long (Fig. 256a,
b, 257d, f; Table 97): three frontal cirri, four frontoventral cirri, one buccal cirrus near anterior
end of paroral, three postoral cirri, two pretransverse cirri, and five transverse cirri. Transverse
cirri conspicuous because rather thick, about 20 µm long and protruding from body proper,
distally not tapered but fringed on left side (Fig. 256a, h, 257a). Frontal cirri and transverse cirri
each composed of three kineties; other cirri of two. Right marginal row commences at level of
buccal vertex, posteriorly slightly shortened, composed of an average of only nine cirri. Left
marginal row extends to body’s midline posteriorly, composed of 10 cirri on average. Transverse
cirri, last marginal cirri, and caudal cirri form conspicuous tuft around posterior end of cell (Fig.
256a, 257a, b, d).
Five dorsal bristle rows in oxytrichid pattern (Fig. 256a, c, i, 257b, c, e; Table 97). Row 1 shortened

anteriorly, with a one-kinetid-wide break posterior to mid-body; row 2 bipolar and distinctly
curved; row 3 shortened posteriorly, often indistinctly separated from row 4; row 4 strongly
shortened anteriorly, consists of an average of only 4 kinetids; dorsomarginal row 5 terminates
about mid-body. Most bristles in vivo 7–10 µm long, last bristles of rows 1, 2 and 4 gradually
elongated to about 15 µm (Fig. 257c). Caudal cirri right of body’s midline, fill gap between ends
of marginal rows, associated with kineties 1, 2 and 4, very motile, 20–25 µm long in vivo.
Oral apparatus extends 36% of body length on average (Fig. 256a, b, 257a, d–f; Table 97). Adoral
zone of ordinary shape, composed of an average of 18 membranelles of usual structure and with
cilia up to 15 µm long in protargol preparations, proximal portion covered by buccal lip (Fig.
257a); largest membranellar bases on average 6 µm width. Buccal cavity in vivo moderately deep
and about 4 µm wide. Membranellar scutum about 3 µm high. Paroral and endoral membrane
slightly curved and almost one upon the other, both end far anteriorly of buccal vertex. Paroral
composed of oblique dikinetids with about 4 µm long cilia, endoral of monokinetids. Pharyngeal
fibres extend vertically to mid-body.
Notes on ontogenesis (Fig. 256i, 257g): The dorsal ciliature develops in Oxytricha s.str. pattern,
i. e., kinety 5 is formed dorsomarginally and kinety 3 divides into two pieces: the longer anterior
piece becomes kinety 3, the short posterior fragment kinety 4. However, the separation of kineties
3 and 4 is often incomplete, similar to Oxytricha opisthomuscorum (PetZ & Foissner 1997).
The fragmentation of kinety 3 occurs comparatively late, i. e., when the division furrow is
already distinct (Fig. 256i, 257g). In other Oxytrichinae, e. g., Oxytricha granulifera Foissner &
adaM, 1983b, Allotricha antarctica (PetZ & Foissner 1996), and Cyrtohymena muscorum (voss
1991), the separation of kineties 3 and 4 begins earlier, i. e., when the division furrow is hardly
recognizable.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality where it appeared two weeks after
rewetting the sample. Grew well in a semi-pure culture fed with some squashed wheat grains.
Remarks (for literature, see berger 1999): Monomicrocaryon euglenivorum fimbricirratum and
M. euglenivorum euglenivorum differ by the features given in their diagnoses, especially by the
transverse cirri (fringed distally vs. acicular; Fig. 256a, d).
The genus → Monomicrocaryon contains 17 species, those well-known lack a one-kinetid-wide
gap in the first dorsal bristle row, as to be found in M. euglenivorum fimbricirratum. Another
conspicuous difference are the elongated posterior dorsal bristles, a feature as yet only found in
M. euglenivorum euglenivorum and in → M. granulatum. However, → M. granulatum can be
clearly distinguished by the cortical granule rows and the acicular transverse cirri.
The only other Monomicrocaryon species with fringed transverse cirri, so typical for M.
euglenivorum fimbricirratum, is → M. crassistilatum. However, M. crassistilatum differs in body
size (90–150 µm vs. 50–70 µm) and lacks elongated dorsal bristles posteriorly. Monomicrocaryon
balladyna and M. opisthomuscorum also resemble M. euglenivorum fimbricirratum but have the
last dorsal bristles not elongated and have acicular, distally not fringed transverse cirri.
761

Monomicrocaryon crassicirratum nov. spec. (Fig. 258a–g, 259a–j; Table 98)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 125 × 50 µm; more or less ovate. Cirri thick and long; buccal
cirrus subapical of paroral membrane, transverse cirri projecting from body proper and fringed
distally. 6 dorsal kineties with 5–10 µm long bristles. 3 thick, up to 30 µm long caudal cirri in
and slightly left of body`s midline. Adoral zone extends about 42% of body length, composed
of an average of 25 comparatively widely spaced, large membranelles with bases up to 16 µm
width. Buccal cavity narrow and almost completely covered by buccal lip. Paroral and endoral
membrane slightly curved and side by side.
Type locality: Soil from the rainforest in the outskirts of the village of Quillabamba, Peru,
72°41’W 12°51’S.
Type material: 1 holotype and 6 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum smuseum in Linz (LI).
Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. Further, we deposited
5 voucher slides from a Brazilian population.
Etymology: Crassicirratum is a composite of the Latin adjectives crassus (thick) and cirratus
(tendrilled) and the thematic vowel •i-, referring to the long, thick cirri.
Description: We studied a population each from Peru (type) and Brazil (Table 98). They
match well, except of body and adoral zone length which are larger by 12% and 25% in the
Peruvian specimens, respectively; furthermore, the dorsal bristles are only 3–5 µm long in the
Brazilian cells which grew poorly in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. We cannot exclude that
the Brazilian population presents a distinct subspecies. Thus, the diagnosis and the following
description contain only Peruvian specimens.
Size in vivo 100–150 × 32–60 µm, usually about 125 × 50 µm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 98 adding 15% preparation shrinkage.
Body more or less ovate, rarely ellipsoid or rectangular; laterally only slightly flattened; anterior
end more or less conical because the adoral zone curves ventrally at distal end where two
membranelles insert ventrolaterally (Fig. 258a, b, d, e, 259a–c, g; Table 98). Nuclear apparatus on
average in central third of body slightly left of midline, consists of two macronuclear nodules and
a micronucleus in between; nuclear figure usually slightly oblique, i. e., anterior macronuclear
nodule under proximal end of buccal cavity, posterior nodule approaching left margin of cell.
Individual macronuclear nodules globular to ellipsoid, on average broadly ellipsoid, contain
many minute nucleoli. Micronucleus about 6 µm across in vivo (8 µm in Brazilian specimens), in
one specimen attached to mid of anterior macronuclear nodule (Fig. 258a, c, d, 259a–c, e; Table
98). Contractile vacuole in or near mid of left body margin (Fig. 258a). Cortex flexible, without
specific granules. Cytoplasm colourless but cells may look dark when studded with highly
refractive crystals 3–10 µm in size, lipid droplets in 4 µm-sized vacuoles, and up to 15µm-sized
food vacuoles containing small ciliates (Vorticellides astyliformis, Protocyclidium terricola)
and flagellates (Polytomella sp., in Brazil an euglenid resembling Peranema and packed with
paramylon grains). Glides rapidly on microscope slide, performing short, fast strokes to and fro.

Ventral view of a representative specimen, length 125 µm. Note the long, thick cirri and, especially, the massive adoral zone
of membranelles. b: Ventral view of holotype specimen, length 95 µm. The arrow marks the distal end of the adoral zone two
membranelles of which curve onto the ventral side. Note the up to 14 µm long and widely spaced adoral membranelles. c: Dorsal
view of a paratype specimen with elongated bristles in the dorsomarginal kineties. Note the massive bases of the caudal cirri and
the obliquely arranged nuclear apparatus. AM – adoral membranelles, AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, CC – caudal cirri,
DB – dorsal bristles, DK1–6 – dorsal kineties, MA – macronuclear nodules, PTC – upper pretransverse cirrus. Scale bars 40 µm.
Cirral pattern oxytrichid, i. e., usually 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri (berger 1999) all
conspicuously long and thick, especially the frontal, transverse and, surprisingly, also the caudal
cirri; last marginal cirri, transverse cirri, and caudal cirri form a rather distinct corona around
posterior body end (Fig. 258a–c, f, 259a–c, g, i, j; Table 98). Invariably three about 25 µm long
frontal cirri in strongly oblique row commencing in body´s midline and ending with frontal
cirrus 3 posterior to last adoral membranelle. Cirrus III/2 close to second frontoterminal cirrus
and posterior to buccal cirrus at level of begin of endoral membrane, i. e., distinctly subapical
of paroral membrane. Left pretransverse cirrus far anterior at or near to level of last postoral
cirrus. Transverse cirri in typical Oxytricha pattern, distal end fringed, about 30 µm long and
thus distinctly projecting from body proper, rearmost cirrus about 12 µm anterior of body end.
Marginal cirri in vivo about 15 µm long, composed of four ciliary rows, arranged in a right and a
left row each comprising about 17 cirri, both rows end close to posterior body margin; right row
commences far subapically (Fig. 258a, b, 259a, b, g, j; Table 98).

cirri, MA – macronuclear nodules, MI – micronucleus, SC – scutum. Scale bars 15 µm (f), 50 µm (g), and 80 µm (d, e).
Dorsal bristles in six rows, row 1 begins subapically, rows 2 and 3 bipolar, row 4 short and
originating from row 3, row 5 ends near mid-body and is generated dorsomarginally, row 6 ends
distinctly anterior of mid-body and is also generated dorsomarginally. Length of bristles highly
variable between populations but also within a single cell: 5–10 µm in Peruvian specimens, 3–5
µm in Brazilian cells. Three caudal cirri in and slightly right of body`s midline, insert very near
to posterior body end, as thick or even slightly thicker than frontal cirri (Fig. 258a, c, 259a, c, d,
i; Table 98).
Oral apparatus full of specific features (Fig. 258a, b, f, 259a, b, f–h, j; Table 98): (i) adoral zone
of membranelles extends 42% of body length on average, as typical for stylonychids; (ii) its distal
end curved ventrally; (iii) cilia of frontal membranelles about 25 µm long; (iv) membranellar
distances wider than usual (~ 1.7 µm between membranelles 12 and 13), resembling Australocirrus
blatterer & Foissner, 1988; (v) membranellar bases as long as in large hypotrichs, viz. about 14
µm as, e. g., in Afrokeronopsis Foissner et al., 2010b; (vi) middle ventral membranelles very likely

composed of five ciliary rows; (vii) buccal cavity narrow in live cells (Fig. 259h; width doubled
in protargol preparations) and almost covered by buccal lip about 6 µm wide in vivo. Adoral
zone composed of an average of 26 membranelles, its massiveness resembling Australocirrus,
as mentioned above. Undulating membranes slightly curved, side by side diverging posteriorly;
paroral membrane longer than endoral anteriorly, extends near left margin of buccal lip, cilia only
7 µm long in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres ordinary.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in Peru, Brazil, and at Venezuelan site (23), i. e., in fertile
Mahadja soil. The Peruvian sample is from a rainforest and consisted of the upper 5 cm litter and
soil layer. The site is occasionally flooded by a stream, and thus the soil is sandy and studded
with fine grass roots; on the surface is some moss; pH 5.8 in water. The Brazilian sample, kindly
collected by Mag. Birgit weissenbaCher, is from the floodplain of the Rio Claro in the northern
Pantanal, 56°73’58’’W 16°62’10’’S. The soil was dusty, lightbrown, and contained few litter and
roots.

Remarks: Monomicrocaryon crassicirratum has a unique combination of features, suggesting
that it is a new species or even a new genus: (i) moderate size, (ii) cirri long and thick, especially
the caudal cirri, (iii) transverse cirri fringed, (iv) adoral zone of membranelles occupies more
than 40% of body length, as in stylonychids (berger 1999), (v) distances between adoral
membranelles wider than usual, resembling Australocirrus, (vi) bases of adoral membranelles
comparatively width, viz., about 14 µm, (vii) dorsal bristles 5–10 µm long, (viii) buccal cavity
narrow and covered by buccal lip. Two species have some similarity (berger 1999): Oxytricha
hymenostomata (similar size and shape, adoral zone occupies > 40% of body length) and
Oxytricha africana Foissner, 1999b (similar size, shape, and oral apparatus, long dorsal bristles).
768

Quadristicha nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Flexible Oxytrichidae with 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri and two macronuclear
nodules with a micronucleus in between. Dorsal kineties do not fragment during ontogenesis; 3
caudal cirri.
Type species: Oxytricha setigera stoKes, 1891.
Etymology: Quadristicha is a composite of the Latin numeral quadri (four) and the Latinized
Greek noun sticha (row), referring to the four non-fragmenting dorsal bristle rows. Feminine
gender.
Species assignable: As yet monotypic: Quadristicha setigera stoKes (1891) nov. comb.
(basionym: Oxytricha setigera stoKes, 1891). Very likely, some of the insufficiently known
Oxytricha species can be affiliated with the new genus as soon as they have been redescribed
with modern methods.
Remarks: Quadristicha differs from → Monomicrocaryon by the genesis of the dorsal ciliature:
intrakinetal and dorsomarginal vs. a fragmenting kinety 3 producing kinety 4. The type species of
Quadristicha is well known (for a review, see berger 1999).
Hemioxytricha nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Flexible Oxytrichidae with 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri and more than 3 caudal
cirri associated with dorsal kineties 1–3; kinety fragmentation absent.
Type species: Hemioxytricha isabelae nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix hemi (half) and the generic name Oxytricha, referring
to the similarity with the genus Oxytricha. Feminine gender.
Remarks: The ventral ciliature of Hemioxytricha is as in typical Oxytricha species (18 FVT-cirri)
while the four non-fragmenting dorsal kineties resemble the new family → Urosomoidae. Thus,
the classification of Hemioxytricha remains obscure. Except of the caudal cirri, Hemioxytricha
matches the genus Heterourosomoida singh & KaMra, 2015.
Most “typical” oxytrichids have two or three caudal cirri (berger 1999) while Hemioxytricha
isabelae has six because kineties 1–3 each produces usually two caudal cirri. An increased
number of caudal cirri is found also in Notohymena australis, Gastrostyla dorsicirrata, and
Allotricha mollis, all being “typical” oxytrichids producing dorsal kinety 4 by a split of kinety
3, in contrast to Hemioxytricha. This indicates that more than three caudal cirri evolved several
times independently. Thus, we raise these species to genus rank.
Aponotohymena nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Flexible Oxytrichidae with 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri and more than 3 caudal
cirri associated with dorsal kineties 1, 2, 4; kinety 3 produces kinety 4.
769

Type species: Aponotohymena australis (Foissner & o´donoghue, 1990) nov. comb. (basionym:
Oxytricha australis Foissner & o´donoghue, 1990). Monotypic!
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the genus-group
name Notohymena. Feminine gender.
Gastrostylides nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Flexible or semirigid oxytrichids with more than 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri
and more than three caudal cirri associated with dorsal kineties 1, 2, 4; kinety 3 produces kinety 4.
Type species: Gastrostylides dorsicirratus (Foissner, 1982) nov. comb. (basionym: Gastrostyla
dorsicirrata Foissner, 1982). Monotypic!
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Greek suffix -ides (similar to; related; deviating) and
the genus-group name Gastrostyla. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Possibly, Gastrostyla (Spetastyla) mystacea minima heMberger, 1985 also belongs to
Gastrostylides because one third of the specimens have four caudal cirri (Foissner et al. 2002).
Allotrichides nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Flexible oxytrichids with 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri, multiple marginal cirral
rows, and 3 caudal cirri produced by dorsal kineties 1, 2, 4; kinety 3 produces kinety 4.
Type species: Allotrichides antarcticus (berger, 1999) nov. comb. (basionym: Onychodromopsis
flexilis PetZ & Foissner, 1996). Monotypic!
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Greek suffix -ides (similar to; related; deviating) and
the genus-group name Allotricha. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Allotricha mollis, type of the genus, has more than three caudal cirri. Thus, a new
genus has to be established for A. antarctica which has usually only three caudal cirri. See berger
(1999) for details of classification.
Hemioxytricha isabelae Foissner & liebetreu nov. spec. (Fig. 260a–h, 261a–g;
Table 99)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 25 µm; narrowly ellipsoid. Four macronuclear nodules and
two large micronuclei. Cortical granules in closely spaced, discontinuous rows, colourless, 0.7–1
µm across in vivo. Transverse cirri protruding from body proper; buccal cirrus near anterior end
of paroral. 4 dorsal kineties and an average six caudal cirri. Adoral zone extends 26% of body
length on average, composed of about 20 membranelles.

Type locality: Galápagos site (68), i. e., highly saline (~ 30‰) soil and bark from a mangrove forest
near the village of Puerto Villamil, Galápagos, south coast of Isabela Island, 0°57’S 90°57’W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens
have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the island it was discovered, i. e., Isabela Island of the Galápagos
archipelago.
Description: This species is rather fragile. Thus, Stieve’s fixative was enriched with some drops
of osmiumtetroxide (2%). Size in vivo 80–120 × 20–35 µm, usually about 100 × 25 µm, as
calculated from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 99 adding 15%

preparation shrinkage. Body length:width ratio in vivo 3–4.2:1, after protargol impregnation 2.8–
4.6:1, on average 3.8:1. Narrowly ellipsoid and indistinctly sigmoid, left margin slightly convex,
right straight; ventral side flat, dorsal slightly convex; right of kinety 4 flattened, producing a
distinct ridge (Fig. 260a, e, f, h). Nuclear apparatus on average in middle quarters of cell, slightly
left of midline, consists of four macronuclear nodules and two micronuclei. Macronuclear nodules
arranged almost serially, anterior nodule commences near level of buccal vertex (Fig. 260a, c,
261e–g; Table 99); slenderly ellipsoid to almost globular, sometimes dumbbell-shaped, on average
10 × 4 µm in protargol preparations; nucleoli 0.5–1 µm across. One micronucleus close to left
anterior half of anterior macronuclear nodule, the second in posterior half of posterior nodule or
in vertex of third and fourth nodule (10 and 11 out of 21 specimens, respectively), conspicuously
large, i. e., about 6 × 4 µm in vivo and 4 × 2 µm on average after protargol impregnation; three
micronuclei in two out of 30 specimens investigated (Fig. 260a, c, 261e–g; Table 99). Contractile
vacuole in or near mid-body at left cell margin (Fig. 260a, e); no activity observed, probably due
to the highly saline environment. Cortex very flexible; cortical granulation conspicuous because
in dense, slightly discontinuous rows and granules rather strongly refractive; individual granules
colourless and 0.7–1 µm across (Fig. 260f, g, 261c, d). Cytoplasm colourless, with some scattered
crystals 2–3 µm in size and many food vacuoles 4–8 µm across in vivo and containing bacteria
(Fig. 260a, 261a). Glides rapidly.
Most cirri 12 µm long in vivo, cirral pattern ordinarily oxytrichid, i. e., usually 18 cirri (berger
1999): three slightly enlarged frontal cirri, four frontoventral cirri, one buccal cirrus right of
anterior end of paroral membrane, three postoral cirri, two pretransverse cirri, and five transverse
cirri (Fig. 260a, b, d, 261e–g; Table 99); pretransverse and transverse cirri 15 µm long in
vivo and thus distinctly projecting from body proper. Right marginal row commences at level
of anterior frontoventral cirrus (= cirrus VI/4), composed of 28 cirri on average; left marginal
row extends almost to body’s midline posteriorly, composed of 27 cirri on average. Ontogenesis
commences with an anlage close to the third postoral cirrus.
Dorsal bristles about 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in four rows (Fig. 260c, 261b; Table 99). Row
1 slightly shortened anteriorly, composed of 10 bristles on average; row 2 shortened anteriorly,
slightly sigmoid, extends to right posterior end of cell, composed of 11 bristles on average; row
3 slightly shortened anteriorly, extends obliquely from anterior midline to right posterior end of
cell, composed of 13 bristles on average; row 4 dorsomarginal, terminates distinctly anterior to
mid-body, composed of 7 bristles on average. Four to seven, on average six caudal cirri associated
with kineties 1, 2 and 3; about 12 µm long after protargol impregnation; in 4 out of 30 specimens
an additional dikinetid posterior to caudal cirri (Fig. 260c; Table 99).
Adoral zone extends 20–32%, on average 26% of body length after protargol impregnation, of
ordinary shape, composed of an average of 20 membranelles of usual structure and with cilia up to
774

12 µm long; largest membranellar bases about 5 µm width in vivo and in protargol preparations
(Fig. 260a, b, d, 261e–g; Table 99). Buccal cavity narrow and shallow, buccal lip angularly
projecting, bears paroral membrane in distinct cleft (Fig. 260a). Undulating membranes slightly
curved and optically intersecting in anterior third or close together (Fig. 260b, d, 261e, f). Endoral
and paroral 11 and 8 µm long on average, respectively; paroral cilia about 5 µm long in vivo.
Pharyngeal fibres extend to mid-body.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at the highly saline (~ 30‰) type locality 10 days
after rewetting the sample.
Remarks: Hemioxytricha isabelae can easily be distinguished from most Oxytricha species by
the four macronuclear nodules, a feature only shared with Oxytricha islandica, which, however,
lacks cortical granules and has only three caudal cirri. → Lepidothrix dorsiincisura is fairly similar
to H. isabelae due to its dorsal furrow, the four dorsal bristle rows, and the four macronuclear
nodules, but it can be distinguished by the larger oral region, the arrangement of its cortical
granules (reticulate vs. densely spaced discontinuous rows), and the number of transverse and
pretransverse cirri (three vs. five and two).
Urosomoididae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Flexible Oxytrichinae, as defined by berger (1999), with less than 18 fronto-ventral-
transverse cirri and 4 or 5 dorsal kineties of which kineties 4 and 5 originate dorsomarginally.
Oral apparatus usually inconspicuous.
Type genus: Urosomoida heMberger in Foissner, 1982.
Genera assignable: Urosomoida heMberger 1985 in Foissner, 1982, with eight species: U.
agilis (engelMann, 1862) heMberger in Foissner, 1982 (type species); U. agiliformis Foissner,
1982; U. minima heMberger, 1985; U. granulifera Foissner, 1996a; U. deserticola Foissner et
al., 2002; U. namibiensis Foissner et al., 2002; → U. halophila nov. spec., → U. galapagensis
nov. spec. → Lepidothrix nov. gen. with L. dorsiincisura as type (basionym: Urosomoida
dorsiincisura Foissner, 1982). → Oxytrichella nov. gen. (with four species mentioned below; type
→ O. mahadjacola nov. spec.); Hemiurosomoida singh & KaMra, 2015 (type: Oxytricha longa
gelei & sZabados, 1950); Paraurosomoida singh & KaMra, 2013 (monotypic with P. indiensis
as type), and Erimophrya Foissner et al., 2002 with E. glatzeli as type and three further species:
E. arenicola Foissner et al., 2002; E. sylvatica Foissner et al., 2005a; and E. quadrinucleata
Foissner et al., 2005a. See berger (1999) and shao et al. (2015) for morphological descriptions.
See also → Hemioxytricha and → Quadristicha.
Remarks: There are several Urosomoida-like genera with or without 18 FVT-cirri and only two
or three dorsal kineties: Apourosomoida Foissner et al., 2002; Vermioxytricha Foissner et al.,
2002; and Heterourosomoida singh & KaMra, 2015.
The main differences between the Oxytrichidae and Urosomoididae are the number of FVT-cirri
(18 vs. less) and dorsal kinety 3 (fragmenting vs. not fragmenting).
775

Unfortunately, molecular sequences are available only for a few genera and species classified
into the new family. The most recent “Urosomoida tree” is flawed by low bootstrap values hardly
providing reliable support for all flexible oxytrichids included (singh & KaMra 2015). But this is
common in hypotrichs (sChMidt et al. 2007, Paiva et al. 2009, Foissner et al. 2014a). Obviously,
more genes must be studied because the hypotrichs are full of plesiomorphies (Foissner et al.
2004, Foissner & stoeCK 2011).
Oxytrichella nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Urosomoidae with a single micronucleus between two macronuclear nodules.
Type species: Oxytrichella mahadjacola nov. spec.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the generic name Oxytricha and the Latin diminutive
ellus, meaning a small Oxytricha. Feminine gender.
Species assignable: Oxytrichella buitkampi (dragesCo & dragesCo-Kerneis, 1986) nov.
comb (basionym: Oxytricha setigera buitKaMP, 1977a), Oxytrichella perthensis (Foissner &
o`donoghue, 1990) nov. comb. (basionym: Urosomoida perthensis Foissner & o`donoghue,
1990); Oxytrichella monostyla (Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002) nov. comb. (basionym:
Urosomoida monostyla Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002) nov. comb., and → Oxytrichella
mahadjacola nov. spec. (type; see below).
Remarks: For reasoning of the new genus, see → Monomicrocaryon. The biogeographic
distribution of the four species is remarkable (for data, see Berger 1999). Oxytrichella perthensis
occurs in Australia and in South Africa, O. monostyla and O. buitkampi occur in Africa, and → O.
mahadjacola was discovered in Venezuela, South America. All species are infrequent, i. e., have
been found only at their type locality. Of course, further research might increase their range but
not greatly because we did not find them in about 1000 other soil samples investigated.
Oxytrichella mahadjacola nov. spec. (Fig. 262a–c, 263a–f; Table 100)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 50 × 17 µm; elongate ellipsoid. 2 macronuclear nodules and
1 micronucleus in between. Buccal cirrus right of posterior end of undulating membranes; 4
frontoventral cirri, 3 posterior of buccal vertex; 3 postoral cirri in mid-body; 4 transverse and 2
pretransverse cirri. Right marginal cirral row commences in mid-body, composed of an average
of 4 cirri. 4 dorsal kineties with up to 8 µm long bristles; kinety 1 with a one-bristle-wide gap
posterior to mid-body; 3 caudal cirri. Adoral zone extends about 31% of body length, composed
of an average of 15 membranelles.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (23), i. e., Mahadja soil from the surroundings of the village of El
Sapo, about 50 km north of Pt. Ayacucho, 67°36’W 5°41’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype

and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The name is a composite of Mahadja (a special agricultural practice mixing
excrements with soil) and the Latin verb colere (to live in), referring to the habitat the species
was discovered.
Description: Size in vivo 40–65 × 14–20 µm, usually about 50 × 17 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 100 adding 15% preparation shrinkage;
up to 2:1 flattened, ventral side flat, dorsal more or less convex. Body elongate ellipsoid, rarely
elongate quadrangular with rounded ends (Fig. 263c); right of dorsal kinety 4 a sudden elevation
of dorsal body in anterior half of cell, producing a minute indentation in outline of body and
an oblique line when viewed ventrally or dorsally (Fig. 262a, 263a, b). Nuclear apparatus in
central third of body left of midline (Fig. 262a, b, 263a–d; Table 100). Macronuclear nodules
almost abutting, globular to ellipsoid, on average broadly ellipsoid in protargol preparations;

nucleoli scattered throughout macronuclear nodules, globular and of ordinary size. Micronucleus
in between or in vertex of macronuclear nodules, globular to broadly ellipsoid, rather refractive
and thus easily recognizable in vivo. Contractile vacuole in left body margin in or near mid-body.
Cortex very flexible, colourless, without specific granules. Cytoplasm without peculiarities, food
vacuoles up to 7 µm across and likely containing bacteria.
Cirral pattern urosomoid, i. e., only 17 FVT-cirri because one transverse cirrus is lacking (Fig.
262a, b, 263a–d; Table 100). Frontal cirri each composed of six, rarely of eight basal bodies,
about 15 µm long in vivo, third cirrus comparatively distant from anterior body end, i. e., at level
of mid buccal cavity; buccal cirrus right of posterior end of undulating membranes, composed of
four basal bodies; four frontoventral cirri each composed of four basal bodies, the last three cirri
posterior of buccal vertex, postoral cirri thus in mid-body each composed of four basal bodies;
two pretransverse and four transverse cirri, the latter about 15 µm long in vivo and slightly
projecting from body proper, composed of approximately nine basal bodies. Right marginal
cirral row commences in or near mid-body, composed of an average of only four cirri each made
of six basal bodies; left marginal row in ordinary pattern, composed of an average of six cirri
each made of six basal bodies except of last cirrus composed of only four basal bodies (Fig. 262a,
b, 263a–d; Table 100).
Four dorsal kineties with bristles up to 8 µm long in vivo (Fig. 262a, c, 263b, c, e, f; Table 100).
Kinety 1 distinctly shortened anteriorly, with a one-kinetid-wide gap in posterior half, composed
of an average of eight dikinetids; kineties 2 and 3 extend slightly obliquely, each composed of
an average of nine dikinetids; kinety 4 originates dorsomarginally (Fig. 263e, f), extends to near
mid-body, composed of an average of six dikinetids. Caudal cirri associated with dorsal kineties
1, 2, and 3, each likely composed of four basal bodies.
Adoral zone extends 31% of body length, composed of an average of 15 membranelles of usual
structure, largest bases about 4 µm width (Fig. 262a, b, 263a–d; Table 100). Buccal cavity of
ordinary width but short and deep. Undulating membranes oblique and moderately curved, of
similar length, optically extend side by side or one upon the other crossing near anterior end.
Pharyngeal fibres distinct, extend to mid-body.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in a mixture of soil and
excrements of domestic animals. Very rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Remarks: The four species assigned to the new genus Oxytrichella are rather difficult to
separate in vivo. See dragesCo & dragesCo-Kerneis (1986) and berger (1999) for the species
mentioned in this paragraph. Oxytrichella buitkampi differs from → O. mahadjacola mainly
by the right marginal cirral row (commencing far subapically vs. in mid-body), frontal cirrus 3
(distinctly vs. slightly posterior to first adoral membranelle), the buccal cirrus (distinctly anterior
to buccal vertex vs. at level of buccal vertex), and the site (Africa vs. Venezuela). Oxytrichella
perthensis differs from → O. mahadjacola by the arrangement of the frontoventral and postoral
cirri (ordinary Oxytricha pattern vs. mahadjacola pattern), the number of marginal cirri (up to 19
vs. up to 7 per row), and the length of the dorsal bristles (10–15 µm vs. up to 8 µm). Oxytrichella
monostyla Foissner et al. (2002) differs from O. mahadjacola by the buccal cirrus (near anterior

In vivo, Oxytrichella mahadjacola is easily mixed with → Quadristicha setigera because the
differences are inconspicuous: 4 vs. 5 transverse cirri; dorsal kinety 1 with vs. without a break
posterior to mid-body; dorsal bristles up to 8 µm long vs. 10–15µm.
Lepidothrix nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Flexible Oxytrichidae ehrenberg, 1838 with less than 18 fronto-ventral-transverse
cirri in Oxytricha pattern. 1 right and 1 left row of marginal cirri. 4 dorsal kineties of which kinety
4 is dorsomarginal. Buccal cavity moderately wide and deep; undulating membranes distinctly
curved but not recurved, intersect optically, almost touch adoral zone of membranelles in left
anterior corner of cell. Resting cyst with 2 size-types of colourless to indistinctly yellowish,
globular lepidosomes.
Type species: Urosomoida dorsiincisura Foissner, 1982.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Greek adjective lepido (covered with small scales)
and the Greek noun thrix (hair ~ ciliate), referring to the lepidosomes of the resting cyst and the
hair-like cirri. Feminine gender.
Species assignable: Lepidothrix dorsiincisura (Foissner, 1982) nov. comb. (basionym:
Urosomoida dorsiincisura Foissner, 1982) and Lepidothrix reticulata (Foissner, agatha &
berger 2002) nov. comb. (basionym: Urosomoida reticulata Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002).
The two species match in most features but differ in the number of macronuclear nodules (4 vs.
2).
Remarks: Hypotrichs as diagnosed above are usually classified in Urosomoida (for reviews,
see berger 1999 and Foissner et al. 2002). However, the resting cysts of U. agilis, type of
the genus, and of U. agiliformis Foissner, 1982 lack lepidosomes (Foissner, unpubl.), which
I consider as a generic and thus most important character of Lepidothrix. Unfortunately, the
resting cyst of L. reticulata has not been described. A second important feature concerns the oral
apparatus, which is large compared with other Urosomoida species. Actually, it is quite similar to
that of → Fragmospina, which has spinous cysts. A further feature common to L. dorsiincisura
and L. reticulata is the crystalline, subcortical reticulum. Possibly, it can serve as a third genus
character when further such species are discovered. However, this feature occurs also in some
other hypotrichs, e. g. in Erimophrya Foissner et al., 2005a.

Asterisks mark parental ciliature which will be resorbed in late and very late dividers. u: A mid-divider with fused macronuclear
nodules and fully developed opisthe adoral zone of membranelles. Likely, the proter has seven anlagen streaks whose cirri are

late divider with distinct division furrow. The new cirri are migrating to their specific sites. The new adoral zone of membranelles
curved to the right anteriorly. The macronuclear mass divided. The arrowhead marks a supernumerary frontal cirrus. w: A late
divider with cirral migration almost finished. Some parental cirri have been resorbed. The proter has seven postoral cirri, the
opisthe has five (instead of the usual three). Although some of the supernumerary cirri will be possibly resorbed, the highly
variable number of postoral and buccal cirri is maintained in the morphostatic specimens (Table 101). The macronuclear nodules
divided a second time. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, BY – buccal cavity, FT – frontoterminal cirri, MA – macronuclear

f, g, j, k, 266a; Table 101). Four macronuclear nodules arranged in a slightly oblique series
commencing near cell’s midline and extending slightly obliquely posteriorly; individual nodules
ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid, studded with nucleoli 1–2 µm across. Two to three micronuclei
attached to and/or between macronuclear nodules. Cortex very flexible, underlain by a curious
reticulum (Fig. 264i, 265b, c) made of organic granules 0.2–0.5 µm across and 1–4 µm long

sized food vacuoles containing naked amoebae, fungal conidia, humus particles, and compact
material, possibly flagellates and/or small ciliates (Fig. 264a). Movement without peculiarities.
Most cirri thick but only about 15 µm long in vivo, arranged in typical Urosomoida pattern
(Fig. 264a, b, 265f–j, o–r, 266a; Table 101; for a review, see berger 1999). Number of FVT-
cirri highly variable (13–23), especially the postoral cirri (3–7). One, rarely two buccal
cirri at second quarter of paroral; three to four pretransverse and transverse cirri in body’s
midline and very near to its end, about 20 µm long in vivo and thus widely projecting
from body proper. Marginal cirral rows frequently almost confluent, i. e., only one cirrus
would be needed to close the gap (Fig. 264b, 265f–h, j, o–r, 266a); right row commences
far away from anterior body end, i. e., near level of last frontoventral cirrus (Table 101).
Dorsal bristles in vivo about 3 µm long, arranged in four rows (Fig. 264c, 265i, k, s, 266b; Table
101): rows 1–3 almost bipolar, row 3 does not split during ontogenesis; row 4 dorsomarginal
ending slightly posterior to mid-body. Two, rarely three caudal cirri in or left of body’s
midline, as thick as marginal cirri, about 20 µm long (Fig. 264a, c, 265i, k, s, 266b; Table 101).
Oral apparatus similar to that of → Fragmospina depressa. Adoral zone of oxytrichid shape

with largest bases about 8 µm wide in protargol preparations (Fig. 264a, b, h, 265a, f, g, j,
s–r, 266a; Table 101). Buccal cavity moderately wide and deep in ordinary specimens (Fig.
1a, 2f) while narrow and deep in slender cells (Fig. 264b, 265g, j), right wall in vivo straight
and thick (Fig. 264a, 265a), anterior margin semicircularly curved, forming a distinct buccal
horn (Fig. 264a, h). Buccal lip conspicuous because up to 10 µm wide, covers posterior
half of buccal cavity and proximal region of adoral zone (Fig. 264a, h). Paroral membrane
composed of zigzagging basal bodies, cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, in protargol preparations
distinctly curved but never recurved, extends to left anterior corner of cell almost touching
adoral zone. Endoral membrane as long as paroral, distinctly curved, optically intersects
paroral in anterior third, cilia 30–40 µm long (!) and thus extending deep into the pharynx.

ellipsoid with an average size of 49.6 × 46.2 µm (n = 10). The cyst wall is 1–1.5 µm thick and
consists of two moderately refractive layers (Fig. 264j, 265m). It is covered by a 3–5 µm thick
slime layer containing two types of lepidosomes, i. e., organic “scales” appearing structureless
in the light microscope. The type I lepidosomes, which are colourless to very slightly yellowish,
have a diameter of 2.5–3 µm and are scattered through the slime layer. Most type II lepidosomes,
793

which are colourless and have a diameter of ≤ 0.5 µm, lie on the cyst wall. The macronuclear
nodules fused, forming a globular mass in cyst centre. The cytoplasm is packed with lipid droplets
2–4 µm across (Fig. 264k, 265m).
Ontogenesis (Fig. 266a–z): The ontogenesis of Lepidothrix dorsiincisura is identical with that
of Urosomoida agiliformis which has been misinterpreted in an important detail by Foissner &
adaM (1983a). Specifically, these authors stated that cirral anlage V originates de novo. However,
their Figure 13 is quite similar to Fig. 266k, l of Lepidothrix, suggesting that cirral anlagen streaks
IV and V are generated by cirrus IV/3; only anlage VI originates de novo. The other anlagen are
generated as usual: anlage I originates from the undulating membranes, anlage II from buccal
cirrus II/2, and anlage III from cirrus III/2. We could not clarify anlagen development in the
opisthe due to the highly variable number of cirri. Likewise we could not determine the number
of cirri produced by the individual anlagen. In both, Lepidothrix dorsiincisura and Urosomoida
agiliformis the ontogenesis begins with three small anarchic fields of basal bodies (Fig. 266c)
and all anlagen develop separately in proter and opisthe. For further details, see explanations to
Fig. 266c–z.
The genesis of the dorsal ciliature is also identical in U. agiliformis and L. dorsiincisura. Kineties
1, 2, 3 develop anlagen but caudal cirri are generated only by kineties 1 and 2. Kinety 4 originates
dorsomarginally.
Occurrence and ecology: Lepidothrix dorsiincisura has been recorded from many habitats but
is possibly absent from Africa and Antarctica (Foissner 1998, Foissner et al. 2002, 2008a). In
the Neotropis, it occurred at several quite different sites, indicating a wide ecological range (see
species list).
Remarks: At first glance, the Galápagos population of L. dorsiincisura appears rather different
from the Austrian one described by Foissner (1982). Specifically, the length:width ratio of the
body is rather different (2.7 vs. 3.4), many specimens are narrowed posteriorly (vs. usually
ellipsoid), the posterior distance of the marginal cirral rows appears narrower in the Galápagos
than in the Austrian specimens, the in vivo structure of the oral apparatus, and the variability in
the number of cirri, e. g., 3–5, on average 4 frontal cirri. Thus, we reinvestigated the protargol-
impregnated Austrian specimens for some of these features. This showed both, specimens
distinctly narrowed posteriorly and with a small distance between the marginal rows (x = 4.1
µm vs. 5.7 µm; Table 101). The finer resolution of the oral structures results from our increased
knowledge of live observation. The high variability of most FVT-cirri could result from the rather
high soil salinity (20‰, see site description). There are also rather pronounced differences in
some morphometrics, especially in the number of frontal and marginal cirri. The high variability
of the Galápagos specimens makes their classification difficult because it covers the pronounced
overall similarity, suggesting that the Galápagos and Austrian populations are conspecific.
Material deposited: Nine voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens from Galápagos
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Some
relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

Description: Urosomoida halophila has an ordinary variability with most variation
coefficients being < 15%, especially those of the important diagnostic features.
798

Size in vivo 55–84 × 15–25 µm, usually about 70 × 20 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 102 adding 25% length and 15% width shrinkage,
respectively (ethanol fixation plus about 10% contractility). Body usually slightly elongate obovate
or elongate ellipsoid, rarely slightly obovate or ellipsoid; slightly flattened laterally; very flexible
and up to 10% contractile (Fig. 267a–d, g, i, 268a–c, d, f; Table 102). Nuclear apparatus in central
quarters of cell, composed of two macronuclear nodules and two micronuclei. Macronuclear
nodules ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid, on average about 11 × 4.5 µm in protargol preparations.
Micronuclei usually attached to macronuclear nodules, globular to bluntly ellipsoid, in vivo about
2 µm in size (Fig. 267b, h, j, 268a–c; Table 102). Contractile vacuole in mid-body at left cell margin
(Fig. 267b). Cortex very flexible, without specific granules. Cytoplasm colourless, studded with
some ordinary crystals, food vacuoles and innumerable pale granules about 1 µm across (Fig.
267b). Feeds on sporulating bacteria, in raw cultures also on small starch grains. Glides slowly
on microscope slide and bottom of Petri dish. Very flexible burrowing in mud and soil aggregates.
Cirral pattern slightly unstable, i. e., extra marginal cirri occur rather frequently isolated or in
short rows; otherwise as typical for genus but frontoventral cirri more close together due to
the short oral area (Fig. 267b, g, i, 268a, c, f–h; Table 102). Three slightly thickened frontal
cirri, one buccal cirrus subapical of paroral membrane, four frontoventral cirri, three narrowly
spaced postoral cirri, two unciliated pretransverse cirri (thus not visible in the SEM, Fig. 268f,
h) rather distant from three to five (x = 4) transverse cirri about 15 µm long in vivo and thus
distinctly projecting from body proper. Marginal cirral rows end subterminally, intracirral
distances gradually increase from anterior to posterior, both rows composed of about 20
cirri 10 µm long in vivo and usually composed of 2 × 3 basal bodies, rarely of mainly 2 × 2.
Dorsal bristles 2.5–3 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations, arranged in four rows (Fig.
267h, j, 268b; Table 102). Rows 1–3 almost bipolar, bristles widely spaced in posterior half;
row 4 dorsomarginal, extends to second quarter of cell, composed of only three to five bristles.
Caudal cirri about 20 µm long in vivo and comparatively thick each likely comprising nine cilia.
Oral apparatus small, adoral zone extends only 20% of body length, composed of an average
of 16 membranelles with largest bases about 4 µm width in vivo (Fig. 267b, g, i, 268a, c, f, g;
Table 102). Buccal cavity flat and narrow, buccal lip covers proximal membranelles. Undulating
membranes straight to slightly curved, staggered, i. e., posterior half of paroral side by side
with anterior half of endoral; paroral cilia in vivo 3 µm long. Pharyngeal fibres inconspicuous.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality where it became rather numerous
in the non-flooded Petri dish culture two weeks after rewetting the sample; a raw culture could
be established with artificial sea water and some squashed wheat grains. With its small, slender
body, the species is well adapted to soil life.
Remarks: Urosomoida halophila is most similar to U. agiliformis Foissner, 1982, a frequent
cosmopolite (Fig. 267e, f). A comparison of the main features (Table 103) shows that these species
differ significantly by the length of the adoral zone of membranelles (slightly overlapping),
the number of adoral membranelles (non-overlapping), and the number of pretransverse and
transverse cirri (non-overlapping). There might be further valuable features but the data from
U. agiliformis are too incomplete. The two non-overlapping features are strong indicators for
considering the hypersaline Venezuelan population as a distinct species.

Urosomoida galapagensis Foissner & liebetreu nov. spec. (Fig. 269a–i, 270a–i;
Table 104)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 90 x 30 µm; narrowly ellipsoid, rarely ellipsoid. 2 macronuclear
nodules with a micronucleus each. Cortical granules in loose rows, colourless to yellowish, about
0.5 µm across. 3 postoral cirri, 4–6 pretransverse and transverse cirri, 4 dorsal kineties and 3 caudal
cirri. Adoral zone extends 28% of body length, composed of an average of 22 membranelles.
Type locality: Galápagos site (68), i. e., saline (~ 30 ‰) soil and tree bark from a mangrove forest
near to the village of Puerto Villamil, south coast of Isabela Island, 0°57’S 90°57’ W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the archipelago where it was discovered, i. e., the Galápagos Islands.
Description: Size in vivo 80–110 × 25–45 µm, usually about 90 × 30 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 104 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage. Body length:width ratio in vivo 2.6–3.7:1, after protargol impregnation slightly
stouter, viz., 1.9–3.3, very likely due to some inflation during preparation (Table 104). Usually
narrowly ellipsoid, rarely ellipsoid with right margin typically less convex than left (Fig. 269a,
b, e, f, 270d–f). Dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1, ventral side flat, dorsal vaulted in mid-body.
Nuclear apparatus on average in middle body third left of body’s midline, anterior macronuclear
nodule commences near level of buccal vertex, distance between macronuclear nodules highly
variable (Fig. 269a, d, 270a, d-f; Table 104). Macronuclear nodules ellipsoid to slenderly ellipsoid,
rarely irregulary reniform, pyriform or dumbbell-shaped, on average 15 × 6 µm in protargol
preparations, occasionally connected by a fine strand; nucleoli irregularly ellipsoid to globular,
up to 2 µm across. Usually one micronucleus attached to each macronuclear nodule, about 2 µm
across after protargol impregnation; out of 30 specimens investigated three had no micronucleus
attached to the posterior macronuclear nodule, one specimen was amicronucleate, and another
had three micronuclei. Contractile vacuole in or near mid-body at left cell margin (Fig. 269a).
800

Cortex very flexible. Cortical granules in loose rows, about 0.5 µm across, slightly yellowish
to colourless; conspicuous, even under brightfield illumination, because strongly refractive, in
cultivated cells even more distinct; impregnate sometimes with protargol, appearing as sand-
like grains (Fig. 269e, h, 270b, c). Cytoplasm colourless, with lipid droplets 1–3 µm across and
some 3–5 µm large crystals of various shapes (Fig. 269a, g, 270a, c). Usually packed with food
vacuoles 4–15 µm across in vivo, contain fungal spores (Fusarium) and rod-shaped bacteria;
young food vacuoles with bacterial rods first ellipsoid and 4–7 µm long, later becoming globular
and 10–15 µm in size (Fig. 269a, 270a). Glides moderately fast.
Cirral pattern constant, number of cirri rather variable (Fig. 269a, b, 270d–f; Table 104): three
slightly enlarged frontal cirri; four frontoventral cirri, left cirrus (= cirrus III/2) usually in mid of
frontoterminal cirri; one buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane; three postoral
cirri in usual pattern, 8 out of 32 specimens with two additional postoral cirri posterior to the

ordinary ones (Fig. 270f); one to three pretransverse cirri; three to four transverse cirri in vivo
15 µm long and thus distinctly projecting from body proper. Bases of pretransverse cirri usually
distinctly smaller than those of all other cirri, nevertheless sometimes difficult to distinguish from
transverse cirri. Marginal cirri about 10 µm long in vivo, distance between cirri increases slightly
from anterior to posterior end in both rows; right marginal row commences at level of anterior
frontoventral cirrus (= cirrus VI/4), distance to posterior end of cell very variable (4–13 µm),
composed of 24 cirri on average; left marginal row extends almost to body’s midline posteriorly,
composed of 23 cirri on average.
Dorsal bristles about 3 µm long in vivo, arranged in four rows (Fig. 269d; Table 104). Row
1 distinctly shortened anteriorly, composed of 9 bristles on average; row 2 slightly shortened
anteriorly, composed of 10 bristles on average, in 15 out of 32 specimens straight in posterior part
(Fig. 269i), in eight specimens with distinct (Fig. 269d) and in seven with a slight posterior bend,
respectively, in two specimens with some scattered dikinetids close to posterior end of kinety;
row 3 bipolar, extends obliquely from anterior midline to right posterior end of cell, composed of
11 bristles on average; row 4 dorsomarginal, terminates about mid-body, composed of 6 bristles
on average. Three caudal cirri associated with kineties 1, 2 and 3, about 15 µm long in vivo (Fig.
269a, d, i, 270f; Table 104).
Oral apparatus extends 25–33%, on average 28% of body length after protargol impregnation
(Fig. 269a, b, 270d–f; Table 104). Adoral zone of ordinary shape, composed of an average of 22
membranelles of usual structure and with cilia up to 13 µm long in vivo; largest membranellar
bases about 6 µm and 5 µm width, respectively, in vivo and in protargol preparations. Buccal
cavity very narrow but rather deep, lip 2–3 µm width. Undulating membranes slightly curved
and optically intersecting in anterior third (Fig. 269c, 270d–f). Paroral composed of oblique
dikinetids with about 3 µm long cilia in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres distinct in protargol preparations,
extend obliquely to mid-body.
805

Notes on Ontogenesis: A few dividers show that the dorsal ciliature develops in Urosomoida
pattern, i. e., dorsal kinety 3 does not fragment and only one dorsomarginal kinety develops.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at the highly saline (~ 30 ‰) type locality one day
after rewetting the sample.
Remarks: The genus Urosomoida contains 11 species, five of which have cortical granules
(berger 1999, Foissner et al. 2002), as U. galapagensis. However, only U. namibiensis has a
similar granule pattern (loose rows) but can easily be distinguished by the number of macronuclear
nodules (four vs. two in U. galapagensis). In U. agilis and U. granulifera, the granules are mainly
around the cirral and bristle bases or form irregular patches, respectively. Urosomoida granulifera
has only two caudal cirri compared to three in U. galapagensis. Urosomoida agilis has three
transverse and pretransverse cirri while there are four to six in U. galapagensis.
Heterourosomoida salinarum nov. spec. (Fig. 271a–h, 272a–c; Table 105)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 35 µm; ellipsoid. 2 ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and 2
micronuclei. Cortical granules scattered, colourless, about 0.5 µm across. Cirri of ordinary size
and length, transverse cirri fringed distally. 5 rows of dorsal bristles 5–6 µm long in vivo; 2
caudal cirri. Adoral zone of membranelles extends 36% of body length, composed of an average
of 23 membranelles. Buccal cavity ordinary; paroral and endoral membrane moderately curved
and optically one upon the other, paroral cilia 8 µm long in vivo.
Type locality: Highly saline (~ 100‰) soil from a dry, flat, small lagoon on the coast of the Santa
Rosa National Park, Costa Rica, 85°38’ W 10°50’ N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked with black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name is a noun in plural genitive and thus does not change the gender
when combined with, e. g., a masculine genus; it refers to the environment, i. e., living and
growing in highly saline habitats.
Description: Ordinarily variable, i. e., most and all important features with a CV ≤ 15% (Table
105).
In vivo measurements suggest about 100% preparation shrinkage! Thus, in vivo values for data
in Table 105 increase to 85–140 × 35–50 µm with averages of about 115 × 40 µm. Body outline
elliptic, laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 271a, f, 272b). Nuclear apparatus in central third and
slightly left of midline of body (Fig. 271a, d, g, 272a, b; Table 105). Macronuclear nodules
close together in most specimens, globular to elongate ellipsoid, on average ellipsoid, with many
minute nucleoli. Two broadly ellipsoid micronuclei attached to various sites of macronuclear
nodules, in vivo about 4 × 3 µm in size. Contractile vacuole near or in mid-body at left margin
of cell (Fig. 271a). Cortical granules mainly within cirral and dorsal bristle rows, colourless,
rather refractive and thus well recognizable although only 0.5 µm across (Fig. 271e). Cytoplasm

18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri, i. e., the typical Oxytricha pattern. The dorsal bristles, which are 5–6 µm long in vivo, shrunk
to 3 µm. AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, CC – caudal cirri, FC3 – frontal cirrus 3, SC – scutum, TC – transverse cirri, 1–5

colourless, packed with few to many lipid droplets and food vacuoles up to 15 µm across. Likely
feeds on bacteria and small protists. Swims and creeps rather rapidly, showing distinct flexibility.
Ventral cirral pattern as typical for Oxytricha s. str. (berger 1999), i. e., with 18 fronto-ventral-
transverse cirri of ordinary size, marginal cirri probably composed of three rows of cilia because
appearing “thick” in vivo. Frontal and frontoventral cirri about 20 µm long in vivo; buccal
cirrus distinctly subapical of paroral membrane; transverse cirri in vivo 25 µm long and thus
conspicuously projecting from body proper, fringed distally. Marginal cirral rows extend to near
posterior body end (Fig. 271a, c, f, 272a, b; Table 105).
Dorsal bristles 5–6 µm long in vivo, arranged in five rows the two rightmost originating
dorsomarginally. Row 3 does not split subterminally as shown by a late divider; row 5 usually
composed of only two kinetids; rows 1 and 2 each produces a caudal cirrus (Fig. 271d, g, h, 272c;
Table 105).
Oral apparatus extends 30–44% of body length, on average 36% in protargol preparations (Fig.
271a, c, f, 272a, b; Table 105). Adoral zone of ordinary shape and structure, composed of an

average of 23 membranelles with largest bases about 10 µm long in vivo. Buccal cavity ordinary;
buccal lip narrow, bears paroral membrane with cilia about 8 µm long in vivo. Paroral and endoral
membrane slightly curved, optically one upon the other. Pharyngeal fibres ordinary.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in a soil and litter sample from
a flat, highly saline (~ 100‰) coastal lagoon.
Remarks: Heterourosomoida salinarum differs from H. lanceolata, type of the genus (singh &
KaMra, 2015), by the presence vs. absence of cortical granules, the location of the buccal cirrus
(far subapical vs. near anterior end of paroral), the arrangement of the undulating membranes
(optically one upon the other vs. side by side), and the number of dorsal kineties (5 vs. 4).
Of course, several Oxytricha species resemble H. salinarum. Oxytricha nauplia lacks (vs.
possesses) cortical granules, has three (vs. 2) caudal cilia, and dorsal kinety 5 has more kinetids.
Oxytricha halophila and O. parahalophila have very likely a single micronucleus between two

macronuclear nodules. Oxytricha similis, for which a modern redescription is not available, differs
by rather vague features, such as the length:width ratio of the body (~3:1 vs. 4:1), the transverse
cirri (fringed distally vs. acute), the cortical granules (present vs. absent), and the habitat (mud
and soil from a highly saline coastal lagoon vs. freshwater). See berger (1999) for a review of
the species mentioned.
Sterkiella ecuadoriana Foissner & heber nov. spec. (Fig. 273a–f, 274a–c; Tables
106, 107)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 145 × 75 µm; ellipsoid to ovate. Nuclear apparatus on average
composed of two ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and three micronuclei. On average 19 frontal-
ventral-transverse cirri, buccal cirrus between first and second third of paroral membrane. Left
marginal row on average composed of 25 cirri, right of 26; rows slightly staggered and almost
confluent at posterior end. Six dorsal kineties, kinety 2 with 32 bristles on average. Usually
three narrowly spaced caudal cirri. Adoral zone extends about 48% of body length, on average
composed of 43 membranelles.

Type locality: Litter and surface soil near the entrance to the El Pahuma Orchid Reserve 35 km
northwest of Quito, Ecuador, 1800 m above sea level, 00°01’N 78°38’W.
Type material: 1 holotype slide and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The species name refers to the Republic of Ecuador, where Sterkiella ecuadoriana
was discovered.
Description: Size in vivo 110–180 × 60–100 µm, usually about 145 × 75 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 106 adding 15 % preparation
shrinkage. Body semirigid, light brown at low magnification, ellipsoid to broadly ovate, both
ends broadly rounded, rarely bluntly pointed posteriorly, dorsoventrally flattened about 2:1 (Fig.
273a–d, 274a, b; Table 106). Nuclear apparatus within central quarters of cell slightly left of
body´s midline, on average composed of two macronuclear nodules and 3–4 micronuclei (Fig.
273a, e, 274b; Table 106). Macronuclear nodules broadly to narrowly ellipsoid, rarely dumbbell-
shaped, on average 25 × 13 µm in protargol preparations; nucleoli 1–4 µm across. Micronuclei
usually attached to macronuclear nodules, globular to ellipsoid, on average 3.2 × 2.5 µm in
protargol preparations. Contractile vacuole in mid-body at left cell margin, collecting canals
extend about one quarter of body length anteriorly and posteriorly (Fig. 273a). Cortical granules
absent (checked with methyl green-pyronin). Food vacuoles scattered throughout body, in vivo
up to 30 µm across, contain bacteria, small ciliates (Protocyclidium terricola), cysts, flagellates
(Polytomella), unicellular green algae, and filamentous cyanobacteria. Usually creeps vividly on
and between soil particles, showing considerable flexibility, rarely swimming appearing rigid
like a board.
Cirral pattern oxytrichid (berger 1999), number of fronto-ventral-transverse cirri, however,
unusually variable (Table 106), causing an average of 19 cirri instead of 18 as typical (Fig. 273a,
c, f, 274a, b). Usually three slightly thickened, in vivo about 22 µm long frontal cirri, right cirrus
posterior of distal-most adoral membranelle, middle cirrus anterior of buccal cirrus, left cirrus
anterior of distal end of undulating membranes; four frontal cirri in one out of 25 specimens.
Invariably one slightly thickened buccal cirrus, in protargol preparations about 15 µm long, on
average 6 µm posterior of distal end of endoral membrane; anterior of distal end of endoral in
one out of 25 specimens investigated. On average five hook-like arranged frontoventral cirri,
about 20 µm long in vivo, anterior-most cirrus usually at level of buccal cirrus. On average three
postoral cirri in inverted L-shaped pattern slightly posterior to body centre, distance between
cirrus V/4 and V/3 on average 13 µm in protargol preparations. Usually two obliquely arranged
pretransverse cirri, about 15 µm long in protargol preparations. On average five hook-like
arranged transverse cirri, slightly thickened and distally fringed, about 30 µm long in vivo and
about 20 µm in protargol preparations, distal half projects from body proper. Marginal cirral rows
posteriorly staggered and almost confluent in body´s midline, leaving an average space of 5.6
µm. Left marginal row difficult to separate from caudal cirri, composed of an average of 25 cirri,
right of 26; cirri about 20 µm long in vivo, 15–16 µm in protargol preparations, composed of two
to three ciliary rows, rarely of one or four, cirral size gradually decreasing posteriorly (Fig. 273a,
c, f, 274a, b; Table 106).

Six dorsal kineties composed of a total of 137 bristles on average (Table 106). Kineties 1–3 bipolar,
kinety 4 slightly shortened anteriorly, kineties 5 and 6 do not extend beyond mid-body (Fig. 273e,
274c). Dorsal bristles 3–4 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations, some parental bristles
occasionally preserved. Caudal cirri in or slightly right of body´s midline at end of bristle rows
1, 2, and 4, about 20 µm long in protargol preparations, conspicuously thin and very narrowly
spaced (distance between first and third cirrus 3.5 µm, Table 106); easily confused with last cirri
of marginal rows; only two caudal cirri in 10 out of 25 specimens investigated (Fig. 273e, 274a;
Table 106).
Adoral zone extends about 48% of body length, on average composed of 43 ordinary membranelles
with about 17 µm long cilia, bases of largest membranelles about 11 µm width in protargol
preparations (Fig. 273a, c, 274a, b; Table 106). Buccal cavity rather flat and narrow, right wall
straight and thickened. Buccal lip about 6 µm wide in vivo, covers proximal membranelles.

intersect optically near or slightly posterior to buccal cirrus. Paroral on average 34 µm long,
commences 12 µm posterior of anterior body end, cilia about 12 µm long in vivo. Endoral
commences 4 µm posterior of paroral and extends to buccal vertex, cilia in vivo likely more than
20 µm long, forming a dense pharyngeal bundle (Fig. 273c, 274a; Table 106).
Notes on ontogenesis: Very similar to that of S. nova (Foissner & berger 1999), i. e., formation
of dorsal kineties in Oxytricha pattern, adoral zone not reorganized, and separate cirral anlagen
for proter and opisthe. Proter’s cirral anlagen formed by undulating membranes and cirri II/2,
III/2, VI/3; opisthe’s anlagen generated by oral primordium and cirri IV/2, V/4. One out of eight
dividers with seven proter cirral anlagen.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. The clumsy body shape suggests
that S. ecuadoriana is a litter species.
Remarks: Four species of the S. histriomuscorum complex have two macronuclear nodules: S.
ecuadoriana, S. histriomuscorum, S. nova, and S. tricirrata. The first three species are easily
distinguished from S. tricirrata by the increased number of transverse cirri (> 3 vs. 3) and dorsal
kineties (6 vs. 5). The comparison in Table 107 reveals that S. ecuadoriana can be separated from
the congeners by body size (124 × 72 µm vs. 74–99 × 39–47 µm), the fringed transverse cirri (vs.
tapered), and the staggered, almost confluent marginal cirral rows (vs. not staggered and more
separate); however, the two last mentioned features have high coefficients of variability (CV =
54.5 and 38.3) and must thus used with care. Furthermore, S. ecuadoriana differs from S. nova

and S. histriomuscorum by the number of adoral membranelles (43 vs. 34 and 30) and by the
number of bristles in dorsal kinety 2 (32 vs. 20 and 18). Interestingly, a Sterkiella population from
activated sludge has some characters similar to S. ecuadoriana (augustin & Foissner 1992).
However, in other features, such as body size, the distance between the caudal cirri, and the
distance between the marginal rows, the sludge population differs clearly from S. ecuadoriana
(Table 107); very likely, it is another distinct species of the S. histriomuscorum complex and
possibly the one most closely related to S. ecuadoriana.
Totothrix nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Oxytrichids with frontoterminal, transverse, and caudal cirri. Two or more rows each
of right and left (marginal?) cirri; one or more curved cirral rows in body´s midline. 5 or 6 fronto-
ventral-transverse cirral anlagen originating in Oxytricha pattern. Dorsal kineties generated by
within anlagen, split of kinety 3, and dorsomarginally. Buccal cavity wide and deep. Adoral zone
of membranelles formed like a question mark. Undulating membranes long, curved, and optically
intersecting.

Type species: Totothrix panamensis nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective totus (complete) and the Greek noun thrix (hair ~
ciliature), meaning a “ciliate with complete cirral pattern”. Feminine gender.
Remarks: The morphostatic and the dividing cirral pattern of T. panamensis indicate that it
has frontoterminal cirri, five or six fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen, and a split of dorsal
kinety 3. Thus, it is very likely an oxytrichid (for a review, see berger 1999). Table 108 compares
Totothrix with similar genera. Each of the features chosen is a genus character. Totothrix differs
from the other genera in having all features while, e. g., Anatoliocirrus lacks fragmentation of
dorsal kinety 3 (Foissner et al. 2002). Of course, there are also other important characteristics
which, however, were excluded because they are not yet known in Totothrix.
Totothrix panamensis nov. spec. (Fig. 275a–g; Tables 108, 109)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 120 × 45 µm; ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid. On average 7 globular
macronuclear nodules and several globular micronuclei in a row left of body´s midline. 2 right
(marginal?) cirral rows, 2–3 left rows, and 1 row in body´s midline composed of 12 cirri on
average and extending about 60% of body length. 4 frontal cirri, 5 frontoterminal cirri, 1 buccal
cirrus, 3 transverse cirri, 2 caudal cirri, and 5 dorsal kineties. Adoral zone of membranelles
occupies about 36% of body length, composed of 41 membranelles on average. Paroral and
endoral membrane intersect in or near mid of buccal cavity.
Type locality: Brownish surface soil (pH 8) from the foot of the Cerro Pirre mountain in the
Darien Forest, Panama, 8°10’N 77°30’W.
Type material: 1 holotype and 4 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Named after the country it was discovered, i. e., Panama, Central America.
Description: This species was very rare and thus only 10 useable specimens were found in the
protargol preparations. Rather variable, i. e., coefficients of variation (CV) often near or above
15%.

Size in vivo 80–140 × 40–55 µm, usually about 120 × 45 µm, as calculated from some live
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 109 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
ellipsoid (~ 2:1) to elongate ellipsoid (~ 3:1) with both ends broadly rounded; flattened laterally
about 2:1 and 3:1 right of dorsomarginal kinety, producing a rather sharp, oblique line when
focused from ventral to dorsal (Fig. 275a, d; Table 109). Nuclear apparatus in left half of cell,
composed of an average of seven macronuclear nodules and three micronuclei, forming a row
between buccal vertex and body end (Fig. 275a, c; Table 109). Macronuclear nodules globular
to broadly ellipsoid, with many ordinarily-sized nucleoli. Micronuclei globular to broadly
ellipsoid, attached to macronuclear row at various positions. Contractile vacuole not studied.
Cortex flexible, countless subcortical crystals in roughly longitudinal rows, individual crystals
granular, oblong, dumbbell-shaped, or drumstick-shaped, up to 3 µm long (Fig. 275e). Cytoplasm
colourless, contains lipid droplets and food vacuoles about 15 µm across (Fig. 275a). Feeds on
bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates, cysts of naked amoebae, and likely also on small and middle-

from right to left; middle cirral row commences anterior to buccal vertex and ends posterior of
mid-body, distinctly convex, number of cirri rather stable (CV 12%); frontoterminal cirri slightly

low number (3) and location between ends of lateral cirral rows.
Dorsal bristles about 3 µm long in protargol preparations, arranged in oxytrichid pattern, i. e.,
with fragmenting row 3 producing row 4: rows 1–3 almost bipolar; row 4 extends near right body
margin, begins about mid-body with widely spaced bristles and ends near caudal cirri; row 5
dorsomarginal, ends about mid-body. Invariably two inconspicuous caudal cirri (Fig. 275c; Table
109).
Oral apparatus conspicuous because of wide and deep buccal cavity and a distinct buccal horn,
similar as in the oxytrichid Cyrtohymena (Fig. 275a, b, d; Table 109). Adoral zone occupies 36%
820

of body length on average, of usual shape and structure, consists of an average of 41 very narrowly
spaced membranelles. Paroral membrane distinctly convex, commences near anterior body end;
endoral membrane slightly convex, crosses paroral near mid of buccal cavity. Pharyngeal fibres
distinct in vivo and in protargol preparations.
Notes on ontogenesis: A very early divider (Fig. 275f) and an early mid-divider with fusing
macronuclear nodules (Fig. 275g) were found in the preparations. They show the following
processes: (i) the ontogenesis begins in the posterior half of the middle cirral row, where minute
anlagen (anarchic fields of basal bodies) are generated left of the cirri (Fig. 275f); (ii) the posterior
two thirds of the middle cirral row are incorporated into a large anarchic field that generates the
anlagen for proter and opisthe, much later in the former than in the latter, which shows five anlagen
streaks (Fig. 275g); (iii) the anterior portion of the middle cirral row does not form anlagen,
suggesting that it consists of frontoterminal cirri; (iv) an anlage is recognizable in the external
cirral row 2 of the right field. Thus, this is very likely a marginal row (Fig. 275g). Considering
that the middle cirral row produces only anlagen for the proter and opisthe frontoventral cirri and
the opisthe oral apparatus, the external row 2 of the right cirral field and row 1 of the left cirral
field possibly produce several marginal rows, as, for instance, in Allotricha, Parakahliella, and
Fragmocirrus (berger 1999, 2011, Foissner 2000b).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Appeared four weeks after rewetting
the sample, indicating a k-selected life strategy.
Remarks: We did not find a species in the literature that could be identical with T. panamensis.
However, there are many species that are similar in size and cirral pattern; they belong
to the genera compared in Table 108 and have been reviewed by berger (1999, 2011). The
following combination of features might be helpful for identifying T. panamensis in live: length
approximately 120 µm; about 7 macronuclear nodules in a row left of body´s midline; countless
subcortical crystals; transverse and caudal cirri inconspicuous; buccal cavity conspicuous, i. e.,
wide and deep as in Cyrtohymena; about 40 adoral membranelles.
Uroleptoides polycirratus (berger & Foissner, 1989) berger, 2008 (Fig. 276a–f)
Supplementary observations: The specimens from the mud of a tree fork in the Dominican
Republic largely agree with previous descriptions (for a review, see berger 2008). Specifically,
the specimens match the Brazilian, South African, and Namibian populations in being about 200
µm long and having about 50 adoral membranelles. Further, about half of the specimens have
one or two supernumerary frontoventral cirri (Fig. 276a, b), while the other half has the pattern
shown in berger (2008). Feeds on Drepanomonas revoluta, Leptopharynx costatus, medium-
sized Colpodas, and heterotrophic flagellates.
Occurrence and ecology: Infrequent, as yet recorded from Madeira, various sites in tropical and
subtropical Africa, and in the Neotropis (see species list). Thus, it is possibly a cosmopolitan,
although records from Europe and Australia are still lacking.

Nudiamphisiella interrupta Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002 (Fig. 277a–e)
The specimens from Venezuelan site (1) match the Namibian type population, except of
body’s length:width ratio (4.3:1 vs. 3:1) and body width (x = 150 × 35 µm, 120–170 × 25–
40 µm, n = 9 vs. x = 150 × 50 µm, 120–170 × 35–55 µm in vivo). Further, body shape is
slightly different, i. e., the posterior region is inconspicuously narrowed and curved to
the left in about 70% of specimens (Fig. 277b–d). The macronuclear nodules sometimes
contain a (protein?) crystal. The colourless cortical granules form rather widely spaced
rows well recognizable because the granules are fairly refractive and 0.5–1 µm across (Fig.
277e). The cytoplasm usually contains many Y- and L-shaped crystals up to 10 µm long.

Afroamphisiella abdita (Foissner, 1997) Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002 (Fig.
278a–d, 279a–g; Table 110)
Material and occurrence: Venezuelan site (21), i. e., a lithotelma of the Orinoco River while
the type population was discovered in rainforest soil near to the town of Cairns, Australia. The
Venezuelan record is the second at all, indicating that A. abdita is a rare species or does not grow
well under the conditions provided by the non-flooded Petri dish method, where it appeared six
days after rewetting the sample.

specimen, length 85 µm. b, c: Ventral and dorsal view of main voucher specimen, showing the important features of the genus
and species: four macronuclear nodules, absence of transverse and caudal cirri, the amphisiellid cirral row (ACR) extending to
mid-body, the short adoral zone of membranelles, and the three dorsal kineties. d: An early divider with two oral primordia (OP)
which later fuse and produce cirral streaks (berger 2008). PF – pharyngeal fibres. Scale bars 30 µm.
Four voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology
Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by
black ink circles on the coverslip.
Morphology: The Venezuelan and the Australian cells are very similar both in morphology and
morphometry (Fig. 278a–d, 279a–d; Table 110). Early dividers also look alike (Fig. 278d, 279e–
g). Thus, we do not provide a redescription but refer the reader to the figures, the morphometric
data (Table 110), and to the monograph of berger (2008). The classification of the genus is
uncertain.

Amphisiellides illuvialis eigner & Foissner, 1994 (Fig. 280a–e, Table 111)
Material: Live observations and protargol-impregnated specimens from Venezuelan site (54).
Two voucher slides, each containing only few specimens, have been deposited in the Biology
Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by
black ink circles on the coverslip.
Morphometry: This population is rather similar to the Austrian type from leaf litter, nameable
differences occur in the following features (Table 111): average body length in protargol
preparations (82.7 µm vs. 98 µm), average length of anterior macronuclear nodule (15.2 µm
vs. 24.3 µm), average number of cirri right of amphisiellid cirral row (usually zero vs. 2.1),
average number of cirri left of amphisiellid cirral row (1.3 vs. 2.1), average number of transverse
cirri (1.5 vs. 2.3), and average number of caudal cirri (2 vs. 3.5). Some of these differences are
rather distinct but possibly insufficient to ascribe subspecies status to the Venezuelan population
because A. illuvialis is highly variable in these and other features, as shown by the high variation
coefficients (Table 111).
826

Fig. 279e–g. Afroamphisiella abdita, early dividers after protargol impregnation. e, f: Very early divider with oral primordium
originating from the two last cirri of the amphisiellid cirral row. The arrows mark first and second cirral row left of the amphisiellid
cirral row. g: Early divider showing an oral primordium not only at the proximal end of the amphisiellid cirral row but also near
the posterior body end where usually are transverse cirri lacking, however, in Afroamphisiella (cp. Fig. 278d). ACR – amphisiellid
cirral row, BA – bacterial spores, BC – buccal cirri, BY – buccal cavity, MA – macronuclear nodule, MI – micronuclei, OP – oral
primordium, PF – pharyngeal fibres, UM – undulating membranes. Scale bars 30 µm.
Additional observations: Body shape elongate ellipsoid to elongate obovate (Fig. 280a–c);
cortical granules absent (carefully checked in four specimens); cirri about 15 µm long; dorsal
bristles 3–4 µm long; buccal cavity narrow and flat, covered almost completely by the buccal lip;
feeds on bacteria.
Generic assignment: berger (2008) transferred A. illuvialis to the genus Nudiamphisiella,
without providing sufficient reasons. Briefly, Nudiamphisiella Foissner, agatha & berger
(2002) is, inter alia, characterized by the absence of transverse cirri that doubtlessly are present
in A. illuvialis, either one (as usual in the Venezuelan population) or more (one transverse cirrus
plus one or several pretransverse cirri in Austrian population).

Stylonychia gibbera Foissner & heber nov. spec. (Fig. 281a–c, f, 282a–k; Table
112)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 55 µm. Outline elliptic to obovate; ventral side flat; convex
dorsal side with two conspicuous humps. Cirral pattern, oral apparatus, and dorsal kineties
stylonychid. Frontoventral cirri in V-pattern; postoral cirri in inverted L-pattern; pretransverse
and transverse cirri in two distinct groups, forming a Y-like figure. Right marginal row on average
consisting of 12 cirri, left of 10. Caudal cirri comparatively narrow-spaced, about 30 µm long.
Adoral zone extends about 45% of body length, composed of an average of 27 membranelles.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (1), i. e., upper soil layer from the Orinoco floodplain at the village
of Cabruta, Lower Orinoco, 66°14′W 7°38′N.
Type material: 1 holotype slide and 7 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens
have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

Etymology: The Latin adjective gibber (humpbacked, humpy) refers to the two dorsal humps, a
key feature of this species.
Description: Size in vivo 80–110 × 40–70 µm usually about 100 × 55 µm, as calculated from
some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 112 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage. Body very rigid and colourless, outline narrowly obovate/elliptic to ordinarily obovate/
elliptic (Fig. 281a, c, 282a–c, i; Table 112). Cell margin leaf-like flattened; ventral side flat; dorsal
convexity more pronounced along right than left margin of body, with two lenticular, about 15 µm
long and 8 µm high humps in central quarters of cell and in midline of dorsal convexity between
kineties two and three; optically above macronuclear nodules; frequently with a longitudinal
furrow and then appearing lip-like (Fig. 281b, f, 282d, h–k; Table 112). Nuclear apparatus usually
in middle third of body slightly left of midline, consists of two macronuclear nodules each with
a micronucleus attached to left margin of nodule (Fig. 281a, f, 282a–c; Table 112). Anterior
nodule at level of buccal cavity, rear nodule on average 13 µm posteriorly; no distance between
nodules in one out of 23 specimens. Individual nodules rotund to ellipsoid, on average 15 × 10
µm after protargol impregnation; nucleoli globular, 0.5–1.5 µm in diameter. Micronuclei globular
to ovoid/broadly ellipsoid, on average 3 × 4 µm; three micronuclei in one out of 24 specimens.
Contractile vacuole in mid-body near left body margin (Fig. 281a, 282a). Cortex rigid; cortical
granules absent. Cytoplasm colourless, densely granulated, contains some lipid droplets and 1
µm-sized crystals. Food vacuoles scattered throughout body, 5–15 µm across, some appearing
empty. Feeds on flagellates (Polytomella), protist cysts, and bacteria, the spores of which remain
undigested. Movement erratic, often paused by jerky stops.
Cirral pattern oxytrichid (berger 1999), i. e., 18 frontal-ventral-transverse cirri in six groups;
17–24 cirri in four out of 42 specimens; anterior basal bodies of cirral bases sometimes barren
(Fig. 281c). Frontal cirri thickened, in convex pattern following body margin, in vivo about 30
µm long. Frontoventral cirri in V-pattern (Fig. 281a, c, 282b, c; Table 112). Buccal cirrus close
to paroral membrane at level of anterior end of endoral. Postoral cirri in inverted L-pattern,
cirrus IV/2 usually the most anterior one (Fig. 281a, c, 282b, c). Transverse cirri thickened and
terminally fringed, both in vivo and in SEM preparations, in vivo about 30 µm long and thus
considerably protruding from body proper, in two distinct groups forming Y-pattern together with
right pretransverse cirrus: right group composed of three cirri in line ending close to posterior
body margin; left group also composed of three cirri, commences left of middle cirrus of right
group and extends obliquely to cell´s midline (Fig. 281a, c, 282b, c, f); rarely in V- pattern (Fig.
282g). Left pretransverse cirrus near body´s midline at or near level of uppermost transverse
cirrus. Marginal cirral rows clearly separate posteriorly; cirri composed of three kineties, rarely
of four, in vivo about 20 µm long. Right row commences at level of anterior end of paroral
membrane, distance between foremost cirri usually slightly increased (Fig. 281a, c, 282b, c).
Six dorsal bristle rows in typical stylonychid pattern more or less disturbed by the dorsal
convexities; kinety 4 shortened anteriorly, kineties 5 and 6 do not reach mid-body; bristles about
3 µm long in vivo and protargol preparations (Fig. 281f, 282h–j; Table 112). Caudal cirri rather
narrowly spaced, in or right of body´s midline, optically between gap of marginal rows, in vivo
conspicuous because about 30 µm long (Fig. 281a, f, 282b, g–i; Table 112).
834

Oral apparatus stylonychid (berger 1999), i. e., with parallel undulating membranes and wide,
flat buccal cavity. Adoral zone occupies about 45 % of body length, composed of an average of
27 ordinary membranelles, bases of largest membranelles about 7 µm width in vivo and 6–8 µm
in protargol preparations (Fig. 281a, c, 282a–c, e; Table 112). Paroral membrane on average 15
µm long, posterior end optically often covering endoral, cilia in vivo gradually decreasing from
10 µm anteriorly to 5 µm posteriorly; endoral membrane of similar length as paroral, distal end
at level of buccal cirrus, proximal end near buccal vertex (Fig. 281a, c, 282b, c; Table 112).
Pharyngeal fibres of ordinary shape and structure, extend transversely to right body margin, 10–
20 µm long (Fig. 281c, 282b).
Notes on ontogenesis: Stomatogenesis begins very close to and left of the uppermost transverse
cirrus (Fig. 282g). The humps are generated in post-dividers (Fig. 282h, j). The dorsal ciliature
develops in Oxytricha pattern as typical for Stylonychia (berger 1999), i. e., dorsal kinety 4
originates from kinety 3 (Fig. 282h).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. The floodplain habitat and the rare
occurrence of stylonychids in soil habitats suggest Stylonychia gibbera as a limnetic species that
excysted in the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Remarks: Within the stylonychids, dorsal processes, one of the main features of S. gibbera,
are known only from Onychodromus grandis (for a review, see berger 1999) and Styxophrya
quadricornutus (Foissner et al. 1987, 2004). These species can easily be distinguished from
S. gibbera by the number of macronuclear nodules (> 2 vs. 2), frontal-ventral-transverse cirri
(> 18 vs. 18), and dorsal kineties (> 6 vs. 6). The molecular data indicate a close relationship of
Styxophrya and Stylonychia (sChlegel et al. 1991, haMMersChMidt et al. 1996); this is sustained
by S. gibbera.
Stylonychia gibbera is probably most closely related to S. bifaria and S. notophora (for a review,
see berger 1999) because they share the same cirral pattern, specifically the V-like arranged
frontoventral cirri, the inversely L-like arranged postoral cirri, and the Y-like pattern formed by
the transverse cirri. Stylonychia bifaria and S. gibbera also share the origin of the oral primordium
close to and left of the uppermost transverse cirrus and the shortened dorsal kinety 4 (Fig. 281g,
282g–j). Beside the absence of dorsal humps, S. bifaria and S. notophora differ from S. gibbera
by the number of marginal cirri (S. gibbera: left row 8–11, right row 9–14 cirri; S. bifaria: 15–19,
14–22; S. notophora: 12–15, 18–22). After all, Stylonychia gibbera has the least number of cirri
in the marginal rows within the genus, possibly except of S. curvata, which, however, likely does
not belong to this genus (berger 1999).
Stylonychia notophorides nov. spec. (Fig. 283a–c, 284a–c; Table 113)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 90 × 35 µm; elongate obovate. On average 18 fronto-ventral-
transverse cirri, cirrus III/2 and buccal cirrus close together at same level subapical of paroral
membrane; postoral cirrus IV/2 slightly anterior of cirrus V/4; transverse cirri in two groups.
Right marginal row composed of an average of 13 cirri, left of 11. 6 dorsal kineties; caudal
cirri narrowly spaced and about 30 µm long. Adoral zone extends about 47% of body length,
composed of 28 membranelles on average.

Type locality: Soil from Venezuelan site (24), i. e., a heavily used pasture in the outskirts of the
town of Puerto Ayacucho, 67°36’W 5°41’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 3 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the species group name notophora, the thematic vowel •i-,
and the Greek suffix -ides (similar), indicating that S. notophora is probably the nearest relative.
Description: Size in vivo 70–105 × 28–36 µm, usually about 90 × 35 µm, as calculated from in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 113 adding 15% preparation shrinkage.
Body invariably moderately obovate, widest site in mid of adoral zone of membranelles, rarely
with an inconspicuous terminal emargination on left margin; anterior and posterior quarter leaf-

Anterior macronuclear nodule underneath of buccal cavity, posterior nodule between buccal
vertex and anteriormost transverse cirrus; individual nodules broadly to slenderly ellipsoid, on
average 13 × 7 µm after protargol impregnation. One to four, on average two broadly ellipsoid
micronuclei attached to various sites of macronuclear nodules (Fig. 283a, c, 284a–c; Table 113).
Contractile vacuole left of buccal vertex, i. e., slightly anterior to mid-body. Cortex inflexible,
bright, without specific granules. Cytoplasm colourless, central third usually studded with some
lipid droplets and many food vacuoles containing a heterotrophic flagellate about 10 µm in size
(Fig. 283a).

Cirral pattern as typical for genus (berger 1999), i. e., usually 18 fronto-ventral-transverse
cirri with some variation, such as a missing frontal or transverse cirrus (Fig. 283a, b, 284a–
c; Table 113). Three moderately enlarged frontal cirri close together right of body´s midline.
Frontoventral cirri in specific pattern, i. e., buccal cirrus and cirrus III/2 side by side anterior to
mid of undulating membranes. Anterior postoral cirri close together, cirrus IV/2 slightly anterior
or at level of cirrus V/4; third postoral cirrus 65% distant from anterior body end. Transverse cirri
distinctly enlarged, in two groups, in vivo about 20 µm long and thus moderately projecting from
body proper. Marginal cirri about 17 µm long, each composed of three ciliary rows, right row
moderately shortened anteriorly and posteriorly, left row extends to body´s midline posteriorly
(Fig. 283a, b, 284a–c; Table 113).
Dorsal bristles 3–4 µm long, arranged in typical Stylonychia pattern, i. e., in four almost bipolar
rows and two strongly shortened dorsomarginal kineties; last bristle of rows 1, 2, 4 close to
caudal cirri in vivo 25–35 µm long and obliquely spread in and right of body`s midline (Fig.
283a, c, 284a, b).
Oral apparatus in typical Stylonychia pattern, i. e., with comparatively short, almost straight
undulating membranes and a large, obtriangular, flat buccal cavity (Fig. 283a, b, 284a–c; Table
113). Adoral zone occupies about 47% of body length, composed of an average of 27 ordinary
membranelles with cilia 15–20 µm long in anterior half of zone. Undulating membranes side by
side or one upon the other, straight or slightly curved. Pharyngeal fibres about 10 µm long.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at Venezuelan sites (24) and (26), i. e., in soil of the
Tachypogon Savannah in the outskirts of the town of Puerto Ayacucho and in the floodplain of the
Orinoco River. Thus, S. notophorides is possibly a limnetic species. At site (24), it occurred two
days after rewetting the sample; at site (26), it occurred after three weeks.
Remarks: Stylonychia notophorides has a unique combination of four important features: (i)
narrowly spaced, about 30 µm long caudal cirri; (ii) transverse cirri in two groups; (iii) buccal
cirrus and cirrus III/2 close together at same level; and (iv) postoral cirrus IV/2 at same level or
slightly anterior to cirrus V/4. There are five congeners with long, narrowly spaced caudal cirri
(berger 1999): Stylonychia notophora, the most similar species, has a different frontoventral cirral
pattern, specifically, the buccal cirrus is distinctly separate from cirrus III/2; further, it has more
adoral membranelles (33–36 vs. 24–29) and marginal cirri (54 according to stoKes`illustration
vs. 24; 32 vs. 24 in the population studied by dragesCo and njine 1971); S. putrina and S.
vorax differ from S. notophorides by the arrangement of the frontoventral cirri; S. curvata has a
different oral apparatus and frontoventral cirral pattern; and S. pusilla has an unclear identity and
might belong to the S. mytilus complex.
Body size and shape are highly similar to those of S. bifaria, Tetmemena pustulata, and S. vorax,
i. e., about 100 × 30 µm and more or less obovate. Thus, be careful in identification.
Stylonychia ammermanni guPta et al., 2001 (Fig. 285a–d, 286a–i; Tables 114,
115)
Observations on Venezuelan site (56) population (Fig. 285a–c, 286a, b, d–i): The main
839

characteristics are compiled and compared in Tables 114 and 115 and the Figures cited.
Additionally, the following peculiarities should be mentioned: (i) outline usually asymmetric,
right margin slightly to distinctly convex, left straight to slightly convex, i. e., similar to the type
population (Fig. 285d, 286c), although guPta et al. (2001) described parallel body margins; (ii)
posterior body end often truncate (vs. rounded; Fig. 285d, 286c); (iii) anomalies in the 18 FVT-
cirral pattern not uncommon, i.e., 17–25 cirri in 31 out of 85 specimens, 18 of them with 21 cirri
(not mentioned in Indian and Chinese populations); (iv) right caudal cirrus optically upon last
cirrus of right marginal row (vs. last 2–3 cirri).
Notes on ontogenesis (Fig. 286b): Cell division follows the pattern of the Stylonychia mytilus
complex (berger 1999, guPta et al. 2001). The oral primordium is formed close to and left of
the unaltered anteriormost transverse cirrus II/1. The postoral cirrus V/4 and the frontoventral
cirri III/2 and IV/3 are modified to primordia. The anterior parts of the undulating membranes are
reorganized while the posterior regions remain unchanged.
Material deposited: 3 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

12°50′E; and in slightly saline (4 ‰) soil and mud from ephemeral ponds on the north coast of
Venezuela, 11°33′N 67°13′W. These records show S. ammermanni to be a limnetic, cosmopolitan
species.
Remarks: The Stylonychia mytilus complex is composed of four species: S. ammermanni, S.
harbinensis, S. lemnae, and S. mytilus (berger 1999, guPta et al. 2001, Xin-bai & aMMerMann
2004). Species of the complex share the same morphogenetic pattern, posteriorly separated
marginal cirral rows, and widely spaced caudal cirri (Fig. 285a–d, 286a–c, e–h). Stylonychia
ammermanni, S. harbinensis, the present Venezuelan population, and specimens from Austria
(Foissner 1982) are easily separated from the other members of the complex by body length (<
844

150 µm) and the shortened dorsal kinety 4 (Fig. 285b–d, 286c, g; Table 115).
Important characters to distinguish S. ammermanni and S. harbinensis, such as a posteriorly
shortened dorsal kinety 3 and a more anteriorly positioned buccal cirrus (Xin-bai & aMMerMann
2004) were disproved by our reinvestigation of the S. ammermanni holotype slide (Fig. 285d,
286c; Table 115). Other characters different between S. ammermanni, S. harbinensis, the
populations from Venezuela and Austria are weak because they usually overlap (Table 115). For
example, the Venezuelan population matches well S. ammermanni in the number of marginal
cirri, while the number of adoral membranelles match better S. harbinensis. The data compiled
in Table 115 suggest that all these populations belong to a single morphospecies, S. ammermanni.
Tetmemena pustulata (Müller, 1786) eigner, 1999 (Fig. 287a–d, 288a–g; Tables
116, 117)
Observations on a Venezuelan population: Detailed morphometric data on the
Venezuelan site (56) population of Tetmemena pustulata are presented in Table 116, and
the main characteristics are compared with those from other populations in Table 117.
The Venezuelan specimens differ rather markedly from other Tetmemena pustulata populations:
generally, all features studied morphometrically are smaller. Of these, the number of adoral
membranelles is perhaps the most important (;ˉ = 28 vs. ≥ 32). There is also a curious
morphological peculiarity (Fig. 287a, b, 288a, d, e): about 60 % (n = 124) of the specimens
have a fairly distinct emargination at right posterior body end, similar to that found in
Urosoma emarginata (for a review, see berger 1999). None of the T. pustulata illustrations
in Foissner et al. (1991), gsChwindt (1991), rosati et al. (1988), and wirnsberger et al.
(1985) shows such a peculiarity. The emargination is indistinct or even lacking in 39 % of
the specimens (Fig. 287c, d, 288c, f, g). Thus, and because of the lack of molecular and cyst
data, we hesitate to classify the Venezuelan population as a distinct species or subspecies.
Material deposited: 4 voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited
in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Occurrence and ecology: According to berger (1999), Tetmemena pustulata is one of the most
common freshwater ciliates and has already been reported from Venezuela, i. e., in moss infusions
from the vicinity of Caracas (sCorZa & Montiel 1954). We found it in the same region, that is,
in slightly saline (4 ‰) soil and mud from ephemeral puddles.
Euplotopsis incisa Foissner, agatha & berger, 2002 (Fig. 289a–e).
The specimens from Venezuelan site (54) match well the original description, except for a 10th
frontoventral cirrus (Fig. 289a) present also in the Saudi Arabian population (Foissner et al.
2002). Here, we present SEM micrographs, showing two main features of E. incisa for the first
time, viz., the incision at the right body margin and the three caudal cirri (Fig. 289a–c, e). Further,
we observed, conjugation (Fig. 289d). See Figures 289a–e for more details.

Heterotrichea and Armorphea
Condylostomides coeruleus nov. spec. (Fig. 290a–j, 291a–y, 292a–l, 293a–i, 294;
Table 118)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 235 × 120 µm; ellipsoid. On average 9 macronuclear nodules
in moniliform pattern, 39 ciliary rows, and 43 adoral membranelles. Conspicuously blueish or
bluegreen due to bright cortical granules about 0.3 µm across and arranged in closely spaced rows.
Resting cyst about 100 µm in diameter, greenish due to cortical granules scattered throughout
cytoplasm and collected in large, polymorphic storages. Escape opening a small convexity.
Macronuclear nodules not fused.
Type locality: Venezuelan site (56), i. e., slightly saline mud and soil from temporary grassland
puddles in the surroundings of the village of Chichiriviche, Morrocoy National Park, 67°13’W
11°33’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 13 paratype slides, including 4 slides with resting cysts, with
protargol- and silver nitrate-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre
of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective coeruleus (blue) refers to the colour of the cortical granules and
of the body.
Description: All data are from cultures set up with Eau de Volvic and some slightly squashed
wheat kernels to support bacterial and protist growth. Some ml from the non-flooded Petri dish
culture were added to the medium providing food for C. coeruleus. Later, Blepharisma americana
and Colpidium colpoda, both ingested by C. coeruleus, were added to obtain cleaner cultures. We
cultivated C. coeruleus for 11 years without problems.
Condylostomides coeruleus has a profound variability with half of the coefficients of variation
between 15% and 25%. However, two important features, viz., the number of ciliary rows and
adoral membranelles have CVs < 10% (Table 118).
Size in vivo 150–315 × 85–155 µm, usually about 235 × 120 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data Table 118 adding 5% preparation shrinkage
(Champy´s fixative with osmium tetroxide); rarely occur smaller or larger specimens, especially
in old cultures. Body shape inconspicuous, i. e., ellipsoid with a more or less distinct concavity
in anterior third of oral apparatus; up to 2:1 flattened laterally (Fig. 290a, f, h, i, 291a, b, i,
j; Table 118). Nuclear apparatus in central fifths of cell´s midline, composed of a moniliform
macronucleus with an average of nine nodules and several micronuclei (Fig. 290a, g, 291k, l,
n, t, 293h; Table 118). Macronuclear nodules globular to broadly ellipsoid, connected by short,
argyrophilic strands; with many ordinary nucleoli; rarely form a loop anteriorly or posteriorly;
first nodule usually distinctly enlarged (Table 118). Micronuclei globular, rarely impregnated with

the protargol method used. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, with two canals extending
to mid-body and a large, central excretory pore (Fig. 290a, f, i). Cytopyge at site of contractile
vacuole, fecal mass with brownish remnants, up to 50 µm in diameter. Cortex very flexible,
dominated by closely spaced rows of pigment granules absent only within and along ciliary rows
(Fig. 290e, 291o–q, 292h, i), overall colour in masses very similar to that of Stentor coeruleus.
Individual granules 0.2–0.5 µm in size, broadly ellipsoid, greyish-green or light blue, at higher
concentration (anterior body region) more greenish than blueish; do not change colour when
cultivated in the dark. Cytoplasm colourless, usually studded with food vacuoles and globular
or lenticular, 1–5 µm-sized granules with a central concavity, as in the resting cysts (Fig. 291r).
Feeds on filamentous bluegreen bacteria, small (Leptopharynx costatus) and large (Blepharisma
americana, Colpidium colpoda) ciliates, small rotifers, and starch grains from the wheat kernels
added to the culture (Fig. 290a, 291l, t, 292e). Glides on bottom of culture dish and swims slowly
rotating about main body axis.

and a short row of basal bodies (arrowheads). b, d: Anterior region of oral apparatus where the paroral membrane is accompanied
by small fields of anarchic basal bodies whose cilia form the “frontal membranelles” (cp. Fig. 291f, g). The adoral membranelles
are associated with a fibrous lamella several of which unite and form a thick fibre (F; see also Fig. 291v, x) extending along the
right margin of the membranellar zone. The anteriormost membranelles are short and consist of only two rows of basal bodies
(numbers 1–4 in Fig. 292d). The further membranelles have a third row beginning with one basal body gradually increasing to
up to six basal bodies (numbers 5–7 and Fig. a, c). AM – adoral membranelles, AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, F – thick

membrane. MA – macronucleus, NOA – new oral apparatus, POA – parental oral apparatus. Scale bars 30 µm (e) and 100 µm (d).
Somatic cilia about 12 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 39 rows twice as narrowly
spaced on right than on left side of cell. Ciliary rows composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids
having ciliated only the anterior basal body, bipolar on right and dorsal side, gradually shortened
along left half of oral opening, irregularly shortened postorally on ventral side; usually a short
kinety fragment right of paroral membrane (Fig. 290a, b, f, g, 291a, b, e, f, i–k, m, n, t, u; Table
118).
Oral apparatus conspicuous, extends on average to 44% of body length, that is, from anterior
body end to near mid-body; oral opening triangular with tip anteriorly (Fig. 290a, b, f, i, 291a,
b, e, f, i–l, t; Table 118). Buccal cavity large but only slightly concave and not contractile, thus
always open, even in preserved specimens; buccal wall lined by long microtubule ribbons
originating from paroral dikinetids, stripes of microtubule ribbons separated by rows of minute,
non-extrusive, conical organelles (Fig. 291c, f, h). Pharynx comparatively small, surrounded by
fusiform structures, likely membrane reservoirs for food vacuole formation (Fig. 290a).

Fig. 294. Molecular phylogeny of Condylostomides coeruleus (from sChMidt et al. 2007b). The tree is based on the ribosomal small
subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences and a Bayesian analysis. The numbers at the nodes represent in order the posterior probabilities
from the Bayesian analysis (first number; 1.000.000 generations), the support values from the maximum likelihood analysis
after 100 replication steps (second number), the bootstrap values from the neighbour joining analysis (third number; 10.000
resamplings), and bootstrap values from the maximum parsimony analysis (fourth number; 2.000 resamplings). Condylostomides
coeruleus is very likely most closely related to Condylostoma spp.
Paroral membrane conspicuous, left of right margin of buccal cavity thus producing a barren stripe
between somatic and oral infraciliature, inverted L-shaped, commences apically and extends to
midline of proximal buccal vertex, composed of dikinetids having 40 µm (!) long cilia producing
a giant velum. Frontal membranelles form a distinct stripe along right anterior quarter of paroral,
composed of closely spaced, about 30 µm long cilia, indistinctly separate from each other forming
cirrus-like structures (Fig. 290a, b, f, i, 291e–h, k, s, t, v–y, 292b, d, 293h; Table 118).

Adoral zone of membranelles conspicuous, extends in a wide spiral from the thickened anterior
left margin of buccal cavity to near mid-body, where it curves right and to body centre; composed
of an average of 43 membranelles strongly decreasing in base length at both ends of zone; longest
bases in mid of zone, 9 µm in protargol preparations, about 15 µm in vivo, and 10–13 µm
in SEM preparations. Individual membranelles separated by inconspicuous intermembranellar
ridges (Fig. 291d, f), composed of two long rows and one short row of basal bodies at right
proximal end, except for three to six anterior membranelles consisting of only two long rows
(Fig. 290a, j, 291y, 292a, c, d). The membranelles produce two major fibre systems, viz., a
thin intermembranellar connective each and a broad lamella that unites with the neighbouring
lamellae to a “thick fibre” extending along right margin of membranellar zone and contacting
frontal membranelles via short transverse fibres (Fig. 290b, 291v–y, 292a–d).
866

Ontogenesis (Fig. 293a–i): Condylostomides coeruleus has a typical heterotrich ontogenesis
demonstrated by the Figures cited (for a review, see Foissner 1996). However, we did not study
it in all details some of which might be different.
Resting cysts (Fig. 290c, d, 291r, 292f–l; Table 118): Spheric to slightly elliptic, with a small
convexity marking escape opening (Fig. 290d, 292g; Table 118). Bluegreen or greenish because
cortical granules stored in large, polymorphic aggregates and throughout cortex and cytoplasm
(Fig. 290c, d, 292g–i). Infraciliature partially maintained and macronuclear nodules not fused,
checked in 30 old, protargol-impregnated cysts (Fig. 292j, l). Cyst contents bipartite in an external,
finely granular layer 5–10 µm thick, and a central portion containing many unsorted fibres,
the macronuclear nodules, countless lipid droplets 1–3 µm across, and globular or lenticular
inclusions with a central concavity and 2–5 µm in size (Fig. 291r, 292h, i).
Cyst wall in vivo composed of three distinct layers (Fig. 290c, d, 292f–h): external layer 2–10 µm
thick, hyaline, structureless, firm, does not impregnate with protargol (Fig. 292f) and thus very
likely not a simple slime cover; middle layer 1–1.5 µm thick, rather refractive and attached to the
internal, strongly compact and refractive layer 1.5–2 µm thick. Middle and internal layer about 3
µm thick, often difficult to distinguish, conspicuous in the bright field microscope.
Molecular phylogeny: sChMidt et al. (2007b) investigated the molecular phylogeny of C.
coeruleus (Condylostomides n. sp. in their paper), using the ribosomal small subunit (Fig. 294).
This shows that C. coeruleus forms a distinct, statistically rather well supported clade sufficient
for genus rank. The nearest relatives are Condylostoma spp.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found in Venezuela (type locality), Costa Rica, and the
Dominican Republic (margin of a mangrove forest). Possibly, C. coeruleus is rather common
in slightly to moderately saline habitats of Central and South America. The large size and blunt
shape indicate that it is a litter or a limnetic species.
Remarks: Condylostomides coeruleus is fairly similar to C. etoschensis Foissner et al, 2002,
which is rather common in saline inland habitats of Namibia, Southwest Africa. Actually, the
morphostatic specimens differ mainly by the colour of the cortical granules (blueish or bluegreen
vs. yellowish or brilliant citrine) and the number of adoral membranelles (56 vs. 43). Main
differences occur in the resting cysts: macronuclear nodules not fused vs. fused; wall with three
vs. two layers; escape opening an inconspicuous convexity vs. a distinct knob; with vs. without
polymorphic cortical granule aggregates in the cytoplasm; size in vivo 106 vs. 44 µm.
Possibly, Condylostomides nigra dragesCo, 1960 should be mentioned because it is similar in
many features to C. coeruleus, such as the blueish cortical granules, body size, and the number
of macronuclear nodules, ciliary rows, and adoral membranelles. However, C. nigra has an
obtriangular (vs. triangular) oral opening, several small contractile vacuoles, and blueish and
colourless (vs. only blueish) cortical granules.
The huge size and the conspicuous colour make C. coeruleus a biogeographic flagship. It is
highly remarkable that a different species occurs in Southwest Africa, Namibia, (see above). As
yet, we did not find a similar species in Laurasian and Australian habitats although we studied
many saline inland samples from Australia.

Apometopidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Pyriform Metopida with special kineties on ventral side of preoral dome and with
almost circular perizonal stripe and adoral zone of paramembranelles.
Type genus: Apometopus nov. gen.
Remarks: The new genus Apometopus, described below, has a unique ciliary pattern, suggesting
the need of a distinct family. As yet, the Metopida janKowsKi, 1980 contain only two families
(lynn 2008): the Caenomorphidae PoChe, 1913 and the Metopidae Kahl, 1927. janKowsKi (2007)
recognized a third family, the Ludioidea, whose ciliary pattern is not known in detail.
Few Metopida have been investigated with modern methods. Thus, we are convinced that
intensified research will discover further families, genera, and species.
Apometopus nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small to middle-sized Apometopidae with 4–5 ventral kineties and a perizonal stripe
composed of 4 kineties. Caudal cilia in semicircular array, not matted or matted appearing like a
cortical spine.
Type species: Apometopus pelobius nov. spec.
Etymology: Apometopus is a composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the genus-
group name Metopus (a ciliate with distinct forehead). Masculine gender.
Species assignable: There is only one species in the literature that could belong to the genus
because it has the same body shape and a matted bundle of caudal cilia (Fig. 295c): Brachonella
caenomorphides Foissner, 1980b. Unfortunately, Foissner’s description is entirely based on live
observations, and thus details of the ciliary pattern are not known. A re-analysis of the original
notes did not provide new insights. Thus, we do not transfer B. caenomorphides to Apometopus.
As concerns → Metopus pyriformis see the following redescription.
Remarks: There is only one genus that looks similar to Apometopus: Cirranter janKowsKi, 1964
(Fig. 295l, m). However, Cirranter has only a single special kinety in the dome centre and lacks
both, ordinary dome kineties and a bundle of long, matted caudal cilia (Penard 1922, Kahl 1932,
janKowsKi 1964). However, the exact ciliary pattern is not known because it has been not yet
investigated with modern methods. Considering the body shape and the circular adoral zone,
Cirranter is classified into the Apometopidae.
Apometopus has four perizonal kineties while other Metopidae have five (dragesCo & dragesCo-
Kerneis 1986, Foissner & agatha 1999, Foissner et al. 2002), a remarkable difference the
significance of which is not yet clear. The bundle of caudal cilia is thick and immobile, thus
looking like a cortical differentiation.
We split Apometopus into two subgenera, according to the arrangement of the caudal cilia.
868

Apometopus (Apometopus) nov. subgen.
Diagnosis: Apometopids with matted caudal cilia appearing like a cortical spine.
Type species: Apometopus pelobius nov. spec.
Apometopus (Apometopus) pelobius nov. spec. (Fig. 295a–k, 296a–f, Table 119)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 50 × 40 µm. Pyriform, postoral width about half of dome width; ratio
of dome height and cone length 1.7:1 on average. Macronucleus and micronucleus in preoral dome,
globular. 2 ordinary dome kineties and an average of 17 cone kineties; caudal bundle composed
of an average of 11 cilia about 45 µm long in vivo. On average 38 adoral paramembranelles.
Type locality: Mangrove swamp in the surroundings of the town of Puerto Plata, Punta Cana,
Dominican Republic, 70°40’W 19°45’N.
Type material: 1 holotype and 2 paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have
been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Greek pelobius refers to the habitat the species was discovered, viz., a Mangrove
swamp.
Description: Size in vivo 45–60 × 35–50 µm, usually about 50 × 40 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 119 adding 15% preparation shrinkage.
Body shape fairly constant, pyriform, ratio of dome and cone length 1.7:1 on average; postoral width
about half of dome width; ventral side flat to slightly convex, dorsal side distinctly convex. Dome
conspicuous because semiglobular in lateral view, separated from narrowed cone by perizonal
stripe; not campanulate (Fig. 295b, g, h, 296a, f). Nuclear apparatus frequently in right posterior
portion of dome, usually deeply impregnated. Macronucleus and micronucleus broadly ellipsoid
to globular; macronuclear nucleoli 1–2 µm across; micronucleus very lightly impregnated in about
one third of specimens (Fig. 295b, f, h, k, 296a–c, e, f). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end
(Fig. 295b). Cortex flexible, contains minute granules likely producing a thin, slimy cover in dying
specimens (Fig. 295a). Cytoplasm colourless, contains some curious, argyrophilic, about 4 × 2
µm-sized bacteria with conical ends and a deeply impregnating central granule (Fig. 295b). Food
vacuoles mainly in dome, contain bacteria, up to 10 µm across. Swims rapidly in wide spirals.
Somatic ciliature dikinetal and complex, consists of five types of kineties: (i) two “ordinary”
dome kineties, (ii) a perizonal kinety stripe, (iii) four curved ventral kineties, (iv) an average
of 17 cone kineties, and (v) a bundle of caudal cilia originating from a distinct row of basal
bodies (Fig. 295b, d, g–j, 296a–d, f, Table 119). Dome kineties commence and end on ventral
side, slightly shorter than perizonal stripe, in fusiform pattern, i. e., rather narrowly spaced
and close to perizonal stripe on ventral side becoming widely spaced, convex, and distinctly
apart from perizonal kineties in middle third of dorsal side, dikinetids comparatively widely
spaced bearing about 15 µm long cilia. Perizonal ciliary stripe near posterior margin of dome,
almost circular, i. e., begins and ends on ventral side but at slightly different levels; consists
of four rows of narrowly spaced, ciliated dikinetids more obliquely arranged in the upper two
rows than in the two lower ones, cilia about 15 µm long in protargol preparations. Ventral
dome surface dominated by four widely spaced, densely ciliated ventral kineties increasingly

distally, only one basal body of dikinetids ciliated (Fig. 295b, g–i, k, 296b, c, f; Table 119).
Oral apparatus metopid, i. e., slightly posterior of dome and consisting of an adoral zone with an
average of 38 paramembranelles; a dikinetal, short paroral membrane; and very long pharyngeal
fibres extending along ventral side to top of dome (Fig. 295b, d, e, g–j, 296a–f; Table 119).
Adoral zone almost circular with right end slightly anterior of left end, i. e., of mouth entrance;
right side and dorsal paramembranelles shorter than ventral ones, except of 5 to 8 shorter and
thicker paramembranelles at mouth entrance (Fig. 296e); left margin of paramembranelles serrate
(Fig. 296a, b), exact structure difficult to recognize, possibly as shown in Figures 295d, g–i.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, that is, in the anoxic, brackish mud
at the margin of a mangrove swamp near Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, 18°38’N 68°28’W.
Comparison with similar species: Apometopus pelobius is easily identified by the special bundle of
caudal cilia. There is only one other species having the same feature: Brachonella caenomorphides
(Fig. 295c). Unfortunately, the description of B. caenomorphides is very incomplete, thus identity
cannot be excluded (see Remarks to genus). However, B. caenomorphides is considerably
smaller than A. pelobius (length about 30 vs. 50 µm), possibly has five (vs. two) “ordinary” dome
kineties, and was discovered in the anoxic mud of an algae-rich pond in the Austrian Central Alps
(Foissner 1980b, c).

Apometopides nov. subgen.
Diagnosis: Apometopids with comparatively widely spaced caudal cilia not forming a spine-like
array.
Type species: Metopus pyriformis levander, 1894.
Etymology: Composite of the generic name Apometopus (see above) and the suffix ides (similar),
referring to the similarity with Apometopus. Masculine gender.

Improved diagnosis: Size in vivo about 55 × 50 µm. Broadly pyriform, postoral width about two
thirds of dome width; ratio of dome height and cone length 1.8:1 on average. Nuclear apparatus
in dome, macronucleus globular, micronucleus broadly ellipsoid. 2 ordinary dome kineties and
an average of 14 cone kineties; about 7 caudal cilia half as long as body. On average 46 adoral
paramembranelles.
Type locality: River Warnow near to the town of Rostock, Germany.
Material: As far as we know, levander (1894) did not deposit type material. We deposited 3
voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens from Australian site (98) in the Biology
Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by
black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Not provided by levander (1894). The Latin adjective pyriformis (pear-shaped)
obviously refers to the shape of the species.
Description of Australian population: Size in vivo 43–70 × 43–67 µm, usually about 55 ×
52 µm as calculated from data in Table 120 adding 15% preparation shrinkage; some in vivo
measurements show a size of 70–90 × 50–60 µm, indicating insufficient fixation and thus 25%–
30% preparation shrinkage (see also macronucleus). levander gives a length of 50–70 µm and
emphasizes that cells could be not well preserved not even with osmic acid. Body shape fairly
constant, broadly pyriform, ratio of dome height and cone length highly variable (CV = 20%), on
average 1.8:1, as in A. pelobia; postoral width about two thirds of dome width; transverse outline
broadly elliptic in vivo; dome conspicuous because semiglobular, separated from narrowed cone
by perizonal stripe; not campanulate; posterior end transverse-truncate, frequently rugged by
contractile vacuole contained (Fig. 297c, f, 298b, c, e; Table 120). Nuclear apparatus in posterior
half of dome, very rarely in upper half of cone, usually closer to ventral than to dorsal side of
cell (Fig. 297c, g, 298b, c; Table 120). Macronucleus globular to broadly ellipsoid, studded with
nucleoli (?) about 1 µm across; macronuclear membrane in most specimens split, possibly due to
insufficient fixation, producing a kind of coat 1–10 µm distant from internal membrane covering
central mass, inner surface of external membrane covered by many granules and filaments
forming reticulate structures. Micronucleus attached to external membrane of macronucleus,
globular to ellipsoid, size rather variable, 5.4 × 3.4 µm in protargol preparations on average (Fig.
297c, g; Table 120); not recognizable in about one quarter of specimens.
Contractile vacuole in posterior body end; excretory pore in pole centre and surrounded by
caudal cilia, gives rise to many fibres extending anteriorly half of cone length (Fig. 297e). Cortex
flexible, contains many extrusomes which elongate to about 10 µm long rods during extrusion
and then to long filaments forming a reticulate envelope (Fig. 297c, 298g); resting extrusomes
not observed. levander (1894) describes the cortex as ”a rather broad and bright zone showing
a radial striation”, indicating that the extrusomes are fine rods. Cytoplasm clear, with some food
vacuoles possibly containing bacteria and small flagellates. Possibly no symbiotic bacteria that,
when present, usually deeply impregnate with protargol.
Somatic ciliature dikinetal and complex, consists of five types of kineties: (i) two “ordinary”

Fig. 297f, g. Apometopus (Apometopides) pyriformis, ventral and dorsal view of Australian holotype specimen after protargol
impregnation, length 50 µm. The most important features of Apometopus are the almost circular adoral zone of paramembranelles
and of perizonal kineties. Further, there are four to five (Fig. 297d) unique, curved kineties which are very densely ciliated and
occupy the ventral side while the dorsal side bears only two dome kineties. AZM – adoral zone of paramembranelles, CC –
dikinetids of caudal cilia, DO1,2 – dome kineties, EM – external membrane, IM – internal membrane, MA – macronucleus, MI –

dome kineties, (ii) a perizonal kinety stripe, (iii) four to five ventral kineties, (iv) an average
of 14 cone kineties, and (v) eight caudal cilia (Fig. 297c–g, 298a–f, h, i; Table 120). Dome
kineties commence and end on ventral side, slightly shorter than perizonal stripe, in fusiform
pattern, i. e., kinety 1 rather close to perizonal stripe while kinety 2 curves anteriorly on dorsal
side and posteriorly on right side; dikinetids comparatively widely spaced. Perizonal ciliary
stripe near posterior margin of dome, almost circular, i.e., begins and ends on ventral side but
at slightly different levels; consists of four rows of narrowly spaced, ciliated dikinetids oriented
in or slightly obliquely to main kinety axis; anterior kinety separated from posterior kineties by
a slightly increased distance. Ventral dome surface dominated by four to five widely spaced,
densely ciliated ventral kineties increasingly curved from proximal to distal dome surface;
most dikinetids obliquely arranged, more widely spaced at ends of kineties; number of ventral
kineties depending on shape: first curved row is kinety 1 (Fig. 297d, f, 298a–d, f). Cone kineties
highly reduced, half consisting of only one to three dikinetids. On average eight comparatively
widely spaced caudal cilia in semicircular pattern, in vivo about half as long as body; very likely
originate from posterior basal body of last dikinetid of dorsal cone kineties (Fig. 297c, e, f, 298a,
b, d; Table 120).
Silverline pattern finely reticulate with meshes about 1 µm in size, as in other metopids (Klein
1930).
Oral apparatus metopid, i. e., slightly posterior of dome and consisting of an adoral zone with
49 paramembranelles on average; a dikinetal, short paroral membrane; and very long pharyngeal

fibres extending along ventral side to top of dome (Fig. 297d–g, 298a–d; Table 120). Adoral zone
almost circular with right end slightly anterior of left end; right side and dorsal paramembranelles
shorter than ventral ones, except of some short paramembranelles at mouth entrance (Fig. 297d,
f, 298c, d); margin of paramembranelles indistinctly serrate due to strongly oblique dikinetids,
exact structure not recognizable.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only in the upper 10 cm litter and soil layer from the dry
Fogg Dam in northern Australia, surroundings of the town of Darwin; pH 5.0. Thus, Apometopus
pyriformis makes resting cysts which were activated in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. It
appeared three weeks after rewetting the sample and anaerobic or microaerobic conditions
prevailed in the lower zones of the culture. We did not find cytoplasmic bacteria so common in
anaerobic metopids and present in some other metopids of this sample. Thus, A. pyriformis can
possibly survive in microaerobic conditions.
880

Remarks: Metopus pyriformis has the typical ciliary pattern of Apometopus, viz., special ventral
kineties on the preoral dome and an almost closed adoral zone of membranelles. Thus, we transfer
Metopus pyriformis to Apometopus (Apometopides) pyriformis (levander, 1894) nov. comb.
We identify the Australian population as Metopus pyriformis which levander (1894) discovered
in a sapropelic river in northern Germany. This species has been never redescribed but was
mentioned in the reviews of Kahl (1932), janKowsKi (1964), and esteban et al. (1995) who
referred it to the genus Brachonella.
levander (1894) describes and illustrates two specimens, according to live observations and
fixation with osmium acid (Fig. 297a, b). They differ considerably in body and macronucleus
shape and the presence vs. absence of caudal cilia. However, the description of levander
(1894) is rather vague and gives the impression that he was uncertain about the conspecificity
of the two “forms”. Our identification is based on a character emphasized by levander (1894),
viz., the almost closed perizonal stripe and adoral zone of membranelles, a feature we use for
defining the new family Apometopidae. Further, body size and shape are quite similar when the
specimen shown in Fig. 297b is fixed as type for M. pyriformis, using articles 67, 69 and 70 of
the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. However, we do not neotypify M. pyriformis
because of the large spatial distance, i. e., we want not exclude the possibility that the Australian
and the German populations are different species.
There are at least two species that are similar to Apometopus pyriformis: M. campanula and M.
galeatus both described by Kahl (1927, 1932). Metopus campanula matches M. pyriformis in
many features but might have a different ciliary pattern, i. e., the five dome kineties possibly
extend to posterior end (janKowsKi, 1964) while Kahl (1932) supposed that the cone is unciliated.
We cannot exclude that M. campanula is a junior synonym of M. pyriformis especially because
Kahl (1932) did not compare these species. Similar problems exist with M. galeatus but this
might be a distinct species because the dome margin is protruding as in a steel helmet.
