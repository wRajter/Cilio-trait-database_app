ABSTRACT: Glass slides were used as artificial substrates for collecting periphytic ciliates from
scallop-farming waters of Jiaozhou Bay near Qingdao (China) over a period of 1 yr. A total of 37
ciliate species, about half of which belong to the orders Hypotrichida and Cyrtophorida, were identi-
fied using living observation and silver impregnation methods. Peaks of ciliate abundance and bio-
mass occurred in November, mainly due to the suctorian Corynophrya lyngbyi, while sessile per-
itrichs (especially Pseudovorticella sinensis, Zoothamnium duplicatum and Z. plumula) dominated
the ciliate communities during August. Vagile ciliates had low abundance and biomass despite
accounting for a large proportion of the species richness. Almost no typical periphytic ciliates were
detected in the winter months (from January to March). Twelve dominant species showed clear
succession over the year and were found to correlate with a variety of environmental variables. Uni-
variate and multivariate analyses were performed in order to explore the relationship between ciliate
community and environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved inorganic nitrogen,
soluble reactive phosphate, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, turbidity). Diversity and evenness
indices were found to be relatively independent of physico-chemical factors, whereas species
richness and the ratio of biomass to abundance were strongly related to nutrients. Multivariate ana-
lyses revealed that temperature, nutrients and salinity may best explain the changes in community
structure of ciliates colonizing the glass slides.
