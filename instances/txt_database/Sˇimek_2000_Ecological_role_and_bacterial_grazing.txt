ABSTRACT: We conducted extensive studies on bacterivory and bacterial production over several
seasons in 2 reservoirs: the meso-eutrophic Rˇímov Reservoir in the Czech Republic and the highly eu-
trophic Sau Reservoir in Spain. Based on abundance, seasonal dynamics, and cell-specific uptake
rates of different ciliate taxa, as well as heterotrophic nanoflagellate bacterivory, we were able to
quantify bacterivory by individual ciliate species, total ciliates, and aggregated protists in these sys-
tems. With increasing trophic status, a higher portion of bacterial production was consumed by pro-
tists, and there was a greater importance of ciliate grazing, accounting for 40 and 50% of the total
protistan bacterivory in the epilimnion of the Rˇímov and Sau reservoirs, respectively. Increases were
attributable to the oligotrichs of the genus Halteria that often numerically dominate freshwater
pelagic ciliate communities. In both reservoirs, the most important ciliate bacterivores in order of im-
portance were: oligotrichs, primarily the bacterivorous Halteria spp., peritrichs, and scuticociliates.
We also examined food vacuole content in natural populations of Halteriaspp.to estimate the propor-
tion of cells that had ingested algae. Our results and a review of previous reports on the abundance of
Halteriaspp. suggest that small halteriids are ecologically important bacterial consumers in meso- to
eutrophic freshwater systems due to: (1) efficient uptake of prey over a large size spectrum (approxi-
mately 0.4 to 5 µm), (2) high clearance rates on picoplankton-sized particles along with (3) high
potential growth rate, and (4) lower vulnerability to metazooplankton predation compared to other
common pelagic ciliates. Correspondingly, we suggest a revised concept of planktonic ciliate bacteri-
vory, where the principal role is attributed to small omnivorous filter-feeding oligotrichous ciliates.

Bacterial production (BP) showed 2 apparent max-
ima, in the middle of May and in early August (Fig.2B),
i.e., shortly after the spring phytoplankton peak, and
coinciding with the summer phytoplankton peak, re-
spectively (data not shown). Minima of BP were ob-
served at the beginning of April (before stratification)
and during the transient stage between the clear water
phase (with the minimum chlorophyll a concentration
of 4 µg l–1in early June) and the onset of the summer
phytoplankton peak by the end of June. On average,
58% of BP was consumed by total protozoa, with
slightly more important ciliate bacterivory (32%) com-
pared to that of HNF (26% of the total BP grazed). On a
seasonal basis, however, there were significant differ-
ences in absolute and relative values of the bacterial
loss rate due to protistan bacterivory. During the late
April-early May period and the clear water phase (first
half of June), protistan bacterivory was generally low
and removed only a small proportion of BP (<25%).
However, protistan bacterivory almost balanced BP for
most of May and the late summer-early fall period.
Grazing of Halteria alone accounted for, on average,
54% of total ciliate bacterivory; thus, changes in total Fig. 2. The Rˇímov Reservoir, April to October 1997. (A) Total cil-
