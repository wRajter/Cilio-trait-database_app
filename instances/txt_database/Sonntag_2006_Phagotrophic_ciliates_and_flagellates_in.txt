ABSTRACT: We followed the changes in the protist assemblage over an annual cycle at 3 sites and
different depths of Traunsee in the Austrian Alps and quantified the variability of the ciliate assem-
blage along successive depth and time intervals, respectively. More than 60 ciliate species were iden-
tified alive and after quantitative protargol staining (QPS). The ciliate diversity was high, and is
described in detail for 50 taxa in time–depth intervals. Rimostrombidium brachykinetum/Rimostrom-
bidium hyalinumand Balanion planctonicumwere the most frequent species, accounting for 44% of
the annual mean abundance and 15% of the annual mean biovolume, respectively. Our results sug-
gested a stronger variability in the ciliate assemblage structure within seasons than along the depth
gradient. Gradual changes in the assemblage structure with depths: (1) were accompanied by a
decrease of algivorous and mixotrophic and an increase of bacterivorous ciliates from surface to
deeper layers; (2) were highly significantly altered with steep depth gradients of their potential food
resources, i.e. the biomass of heterotrophic flagellates, bacteria and algae; and (3) were related with
lower significance to environmental parameters. High similarity (>80%) between successive months
was reached only when net changes in the total ciliate abundance were negligible, while a strong
increase or decrease in the ciliate abundance was associated with pronounced changes in the species
composition. These seasonal changes in the ciliate assemblage structure (4) were linked to shifts of
algivorous and mixotrophic, but not of bacterivorous ciliates and (5) were less predictable with food
resources compared to the depth gradient. The phagotrophic flagellates generally followed the
seasonal and vertical patterns described for ciliates, and were shown to be important members of the
planktonic food web in a cold, deep, oligotrophic lake.
