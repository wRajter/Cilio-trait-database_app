Abstract
The morphology and divisional morphogenesis in a Chinese population of Neobakuella aenigmatica Moon et al., 2019
are reinvestigated. The body size, number and arrangement of parabuccal cirri and development of nuclear nodules in this
population are discussed in comparison with closely related genera. The 18S rRNA gene sequence of the Chinese popula-
tion is identical to that of a Korean population, supporting a distant relationship between N. aenigmatica and the cluster of
N. flava and Apobakuella fusca. We deduce that this may be caused by the differences in the pattern of the parabuccal cirri
and the number of parabuccal rows which are important for the phylogeny of Bakuella-like species.
