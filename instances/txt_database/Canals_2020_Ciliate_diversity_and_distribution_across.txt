ABSTRACT
elcitrA
Ciliates are globally distributed eukaryotic organisms inhabiting virtually all environments on
Earth. Although ciliates range from 10 µm to few mm in cell size, they are repeatedly reported in
the pico-sized fraction (smaller than 2-3 µm) of molecular surveys. Here, we used existing
datasets (BioMarKs and Tara Oceans) with different size fractions to demonstrate that the ciliate
pico-sized signal, likely derived from cell breakage during filtration, is informative and reliable to
study marine ciliate biodiversity and biogeography. Then, we used sequences from the
picoeukaryotic fraction of two circumnavigation expeditions, Malaspina-2010 and Tara Oceans, to
give insights into the taxonomic composition and horizontal and vertical distribution of ciliates in
the global ocean. Results suggested a high homogeneity of ciliate communities along the ocean
surface from temperate to tropical waters, with ciliate assemblages dominated by a few abundant
and widely distributed taxa. Very few taxa were found in a single oceanic region, therefore
suggesting a high level of ciliate cosmopolitanism in the global ocean. In vertical profiles, ciliates
were detected up to 4000 m depth, and a clear vertical community structuring was observed. Our
results provided evidence supporting ciliates as deeply integrated organisms in the deep-sea
trophic web, where they may play a relevant role as symbionts of metazoans and grazers of
prokaryotes and small eukaryotes in the water column and in aggregates.

1. INTRODUCTION
elcitrA
Ciliates are unicellular eukaryotic organisms belonging to the Alveolata supergroup, having cell
sizes from about 10 µm to a few millimeters (Lynn, 2008). These organisms colonize nearly all
environments on Earth, being found in marine and freshwater plankton and benthos, soils
(Foissner, Chao, & Katz, 2008; Lynn, 2008), and extreme environments (Hu, 2014). They display
a great variety of ecological strategies, from free-living to symbionts and from heterotrophy to
mixotrophy, and have a wide range of optimal preys (Lynn, 2008). In marine environments, free-
living ciliates are primarily considered to play an important role as trophic links between primary
producers and larger consumers (Gifford, 1991; Porter, Sherr, Sherr, Pace, & Sanders, 1985). In
addition, mixotrophic ciliates can significantly contribute to primary production (up to 70% in some
cases), and many species display symbiotic interactions with fishes (including some parasites
causing important economic losses), invertebrates and even prokaryotes, showing that ciliates
are deeply integrated in marine ecosystems (Lynn, 2008). The dominant marine planktonic
species belong to the Orders Oligotrichida and Choreotrichida (Class Spirotrichea) (Gómez,
2007; Lynn, 2008; Rychert, Nawacka, Majchrowski, & Zapadka, 2014; Santoferrara,
Grattepanche, Katz, & McManus, 2014; Vaqué, Blough, & Duarte, 1997; Vaqué et al., 2014), and
are members of nanoplankton (2-20 µm) and microplankton (20-200 µm) communities.

Consequently, assessments of ciliate biodiversity by molecular methods have been mostly
performed on these two size-fractions (Bachy, Moreira, Dolan, & López-García, 2014;
Grattepanche, Santoferrara, McManus, & Katz, 2015; Grattepanche, Santoferrara, McManus, &
Katz, 2016; Sun et al. 2017) or on the whole community collected in 0.2 to 0.8 µm pore-size filters
(Pitsch et al., 2019; Stock et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2017). However, ciliate
sequences have been systematically reported in the smallest size fraction, the picoplankton
(0.2/0.8-2/3 µm) (Cheung, Chu, Li, Kwan, & Wong, 2008; de Vargas et al., 2015; Giner et al.,
2019; Not, del Campo, Balagué, de Vargas, & Massana, 2009; Sørensen, Daugbjerg, &
Gabrielsen, 2012), but these have been seldom considered, representing a promising additional
resource to further study some ciliate ecology issues like biodiversity, community structure and
biogeography.
The relatively recent application of HTS (High Throughput Sequencing) technology to assess
microbial diversity has contributed to solve the debate about biogeography of protist species (and
by extension ciliates). This debate was moved by two alternative beliefs: i) all protist species are
cosmopolitan and respond to the aphorism “everything is everywhere, but the environment
selects” (Finlay, Esteban, & Fenchel, 2004), and ii) protists have many cosmopolitan species but
also a significant number of endemic species, as proposed by the moderate endemicity model
(Foissner, 2006; Foissner et al., 2008). Recent microscopic and molecular studies have

confirmed many cases of cosmopolitanism but also biogeographic patterns for benthic (Azovsky
elcitrA
& Mazei, 2013) and planktonic marine ciliates (Agatha, 2011; Dolan & Pierce, 2012; Santoferrara,
Rubin, & McManus, 2018). However, most studies on marine ciliates have been performed in
neritic waters (shallow regions above continental margins), often across short transects, and
mainly focusing on Tintinnina species (loricate Choreotrichida), which due to their external lorica
or shell are easier to collect in plankton nets, and to be microscopically identified, than aloricate
ciliates (ciliates without an external lorica). Indeed, aloricate ciliates remain less studied (Agatha,
2011), even though they account for the majority of ciliate diversity and abundance in marine
waters (Pitta, Giannakourou, & Christaki, 2001; Rychert et al., 2014; Vaqué et al., 1997; Vaqué et
al., 2004). Therefore, there is still the need for studies focusing on the whole Ciliophora diversity
along the global ocean, as the work of Gimmler, Korn, de Vargas, Audic, & Stoeck (2016) in the
context of Tara Oceans expedition. These authors aimed to uncover the environmental factors
that drive ciliate diversity in the global sunlit ocean, providing insights on ciliate biogeography and
diversity at the group level. However, no data of the most abundant ciliates in the open ocean at
a species level were provided.
Albeit most studies on marine ciliates have been performed in surface waters, the presence of
deep-sea ciliates has been systematically reported by both microscopic (Agusti et al., 2015;
detpeccA
Silver, Gowing, Brownlee, & Corliss, 1984; Sohrin, Imazawa, Fukuda, & Suzuki, 2010; Tanaka &
Rassoulzadegan, 2002) and molecular approaches (Countway et al., 2007; Giner et al., 2020; Hu
et al., 2018; Sauvadet, Gobet, & Guillou, 2010). Few studies have focused on the distribution of
ciliate communities across depth, some being limited to the photic layers, i.e. from surface to
about 200 m depth (Christaki et al. 2011; Pitta et al., 2001; Santoferrara, Gómez, & Alder, 2011),
and others also providing data below the photic zone (Grattepanche et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019;
Wickham, Steinmair, & Kamennaya, 2011; Zhao, Filker, Xu, Huang, & Zheng, 2017). Only Zhao
et al. (2017) provided taxonomic insights on open ocean planktonic ciliates below 2000 m depth.
Thus, research is needed to uncover the hidden diversity of ciliates in the dark ocean and to
explore their role in the deep ocean food web and their involvement in the carbon pump and other
biogeochemical cycles.
Here, we used existing sequencing datasets assessing marine eukaryotic diversity to analyze, in
the first place, how fractionated filtration determines Ciliophora detection, in order to evaluate the
reliability of using the data from the pico-sized fraction to study some aspects of ciliate ecology.
For that purpose, we used two molecular surveys containing pico-, nano- and micro-sized
fractions: BioMarKs (Massana et al., 2015) and Tara Oceans (de Vargas et al., 2015).
Considering the fragility of most ciliate cells and their previous detection in the pico-sized fraction,
we expected this fraction to be at least as informative for ciliate ecology as nano- and micro-sized

fractions are. Second, we aimed to study the diversity and horizontal and vertical distribution of
elcitrA
open ocean ciliate taxa using the pico-sized fraction from Malaspina-2010 (Giner et al., 2020;
Logares et al., 2020) and Tara Oceans (de Vargas et al.; 2015) circumnavigation expeditions.
Since diversity, community composition and biogeography of ciliates in the open sea are still
understudied as compared to coastal zones, we expect to provide new insights on these
ecological aspects both in a wide surface report and across the water column.
2. MATERIAL and METHODS
2.1. Sequencing datasets and environmental data
Data for the size fractionated analysis include previously published eukaryotic surveys of three
size fractions from the BioMarKs project (BMK; Massana et al., 2015) and Tara Oceans
circumnavigation expedition (from 2009 to 2013) (Tara-Fract; de Vargas et al., 2015). Pico-sized
subsamples (0.8 to 3 µm in BMK and 0.8 to 5 µm in Tara), nano-sized subsamples (3 to 20 µm
and 5 to 20 µm), and micro-sized subsamples in Tara (20 to 180 µm) were obtained by sequential
filtration. Micro-sized subsamples from BMK (20 to 200 µm) were collected by towing for 5–15
min a plankton net of 20 μm mesh size. Extracted DNA from these subsamples was used to
detpeccA
amplify the V4 or V9 region of the 18S rDNA gene. In BMK, V4 sequences were obtained in a
454 platform and clustered in OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) by similarity at 97%
(Massana et al., 2015). In Tara, V9 sequences were obtained in an Illumina platform and
clustered by Swarm (de Vargas et al., 2015). Only subsamples with at least 30 Ciliophora OTUs,
a threshold established to avoid putative randomness due to low sequencing depth, were
considered: 5 samples from BMK (15 subsamples considering the three fractions) and 43 from
Tara (129 subsamples).
Data for the distribution of ciliates in the global ocean derive from the Malaspina expedition (from
December 2010 to July 2011) (Logares et al. 2020; Giner et al. 2020), targeting the V4 18S rDNA
of pico-sized marine plankton (0.2 to 3 μm), and the Tara Ocean expedition, targeting the V9 of
the 0.8 to 5 μm size fraction (de Vargas et al. 2015, Pesant et al. 2015). Environmental data for
both expeditions included salinity, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, turbidity, chlorophyll, oxygen and
temperature. The horizontal survey consists of surface ocean samples (~3 m depth) collected
during Malaspina (subset named MPN-SRF, 113 samples) and Tara Oceans (Tara-SRF, 41
samples). Stations were attributed to a given oceanic region based on their geographic
coordinates. Vertical profiles consist on samples from the Malaspina expedition collected at the
surface (~3 m), deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), mesopelagic zone (200 to 1000 m; some of
them in the oxygen minimum zone [OMZ] or the deep scattering layer [DSL]) and bathypelagic

zone (1000 to 4000 m) (Giner et al., 2020). For these profiles, community DNA and RNA from the
elcitrA
pico-sized fraction (0.2 to 3 μm) was extracted simultaneously, resulting in the MPN-DNA dataset
(62 samples from 12 stations) and the MPN-RNA dataset (91 samples from 13 stations).
Malaspina V4 sequences from the three datasets were separately processed using DADA2
(Callahan et al., 2016) to get amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using the following parameters:
pool=TRUE, trunclen=220,210 (240,210 in MPN-SRF) and maxEE=6,8. Finally, the extracted
DNA from a subset of vertical profiles was used to amplify the V9 region of the 18S rDNA
followed by Illumina sequencing (Obiol et al., 2020). The MPN-V9 dataset comprised 30 samples
from 6 stations and was processed by DADA2 using the parameters: pool=TRUE,
trunclen=110,90 and maxEE=4,6.
A summary of all sequencing datasets is shown in Table 1. Regardless of the clustering method
used, the taxonomic units generated (ASVs, swarms and OTU ) are referred to as OTUs
97
throughout the text. Rarefaction was applied to avoid biases due to different sequencing depths
by using the rrarefy function of the vegan package (v2.5-4; Oksanen et al., 2019) within the R
Statistical environment (R version 3.6.2, R Development Core Team, 2008). The rarefaction
threshold for each dataset is specified in Table 1. Overall, 99 samples were kept in MPN-SRF, 41
in Tara-SRF, 40 in MPN-DNA (11 in surface, 10 in DCM, 9 in mesopelagic, and 10 in
detpeccA
bathypelagic), 75 in MPN-RNA (13, 13, 31, and 18) and 22 in MPN-V9 (5, 4, 6, and 7) after the
rarefaction.
2.2. Taxonomic assignment of Ciliophora sequences
Taxonomic assignment of eukaryotic sequences was performed using BLAST (Altschul, Gish,
Miller, Myers, & Lipman, 1990) against the PR2 (Guillou et al., 2013) reference database (V4 and
V9 OTUs), and against the eukaryotesV4 (Obiol et al. 2020) database (V4 OTUs). Sequences
initially identified as ciliates were retrieved from the original dataset and validated using the
EukRef-Ciliophora database (Boscaro et al., 2018). Ciliate sequences were then classified at a
Class level (whenever possible) following the current classification (Adl et al., 2019) based on
BLAST searches against the PR2 database. For the V4 dataset, classification into ciliate groups
was further confirmed with phylogenetic trees with a subset from EukRef-Ciliophora database
covering all Ciliophora classes. For tree construction, query and reference sequences were
aligned using MAFFT (Katoh & Standley, 2013), and phylogenetic trees were constructed using
RAxML 8.2.12 (Stamatakis, 2014) under the model GTRCATI. The Class Spirotrichea was
separated into the lower taxonomic ranks Euplotia, Hypotrichia, Licnophoridae, Oligotrichida,
Strobilidiina and Tintinnina, in response to the high relevance of spirotrichs in marine
ecosystems. Also, some of these groups possess evident morphological traits that allow easy

comparison of molecular and microscopic data. We used Nassophorea and Prostomatea classes
elcitrA
although both are nowadays considered polyphyletic (Boscaro et al., 2018).
To identify the V4 and V9 OTUs that putatively derive from the same ciliate species, we selected
the 100 most abundant sequences in MPN-SRF (V4 amplicons) and Tara-SRF (V9 amplicons)
datasets and performed a BLAST search to get the closest GenBank reference sequence. These
sequences were used to construct a reference phylogenetic tree (by RAxML after a MAFFT
alignment), which was then used for the placement of V4 and V9 sequences by the evolutionary
placement algorithm (EPA; Berger, Krompass, Stamatakis, 2011), designed for phylogenetic
placement of short sequences (data available at Zenodo repository, doi:
10.5281/zenodo.3736633). Based on this tree, we considered that a pair of V4 and V9 OTUs
correspond to the same phylotype when i) they matched to a same reference sequence at a
similarity >98%, and ii) there was no other reference sequence covering both 18S regions
displaying a higher similarity with only one sequence of the query pair.
2.3. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed within the R Statistical environment (R version 3.6.2).
Ordination of communities was carried out using non‐metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
detpeccA
analyses based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices (vegdist function, vegan package v2.5-4).
ANOSIM (analysis of similarity; Clarke, 1993) was used to test whether there were significant
differences between predefined sample groups (anosim function, vegan package). Mantel test
(mantel function, vegan package) was used to assess whether variations of ciliate community
composition correlated with environmental parameters. The effect of each environmental
parameter on the ciliate community structure was measured by PERMANOVA (permutational
analysis of variance) (adonis function, vegan package). Venn diagrams were done to visualize
the OTU overlap among fractions and water layers (eulerr package v5.1.0; Larsson, 2019). An
IndVal (Indicator Value) analysis (Dufrene & Legendre, 1997) was applied to detect the OTUs
significantly related to a given depth layer (labdsv package v1.8-0; Roberts, 2006). Following
Logares et al. (2013), OTUs displaying a p-value <0.05 and IndVal values >0.5 were considered.
Only OTUs appearing in at least 5 samples were considered for the IndVal analysis. Alpha
diversity analyses were based on the Shannon index (H’) and the richness (number of OTUs).
3. RESULTS
3.1. Ciliophora signal across size fractionated samples

different plankton fractions. Despite the large difference in the total number of OTUs detected in
elcitrA
BMK (109 OTUs) and Tara-Fract (861 OTUs), in both datasets the pico-sized fraction exhibited
the highest alpha diversity across fractions (Figure 1A), both in terms of Richness and Shannon
indices, while the micro-sized fraction was the least diverse. This lower diversity in the larger size
fraction contrasts with a higher proportion of ciliate reads with respect to the total eukaryotic
reads (median of 28.2% in BMK and of 2.4% in Tara-Fract; data not shown). Ordination of
subsamples by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed the grouping of Ciliophora
communities based on the size fraction analyzed. In BMK, pico- and nano-sized subsamples
grouped together (Figure 1B) while micro-sized ones were spread across the two-dimensional
space. In Tara-Fract, the three size fractions grouped clearly separated, with higher cohesion
observed in pico- and micro-sized fractions as compared to nano-sized ones. The ANOSIM test
statistically supported the grouping of samples by fraction in both BMK (R coefficient: 0.416, p-
value: 0.0014) and Tara-Fract (R: 0.645, p-value: 0.0001) datasets.
Oligotrichida, Tintininna and to a lesser extent Strobilidiina and Oligohymenophorea were the
Ciliophora groups that showed the clearest variation across fractions in both datasets (Figure
1C). Oligotrichida dominated the pico-sized fraction in BMK dataset (40.3% of OTUs and 74.7%
of reads) and was also prominent in Tara-Fract (28.5% of reads), while its richness and relative
detpeccA
abundance dramatically decreased in the micro-sized fraction, being absent in BMK and
accounting for only 2.6% of reads in Tara-Fract. An opposed pattern was observed for Tintinnina,
which dominated in the micro-sized fraction and were scarcely detected in the smallest fraction in
both datasets. Thus, Tintinnina represented 9.7 and 4.7% of OTUs and 3.5 and 4.1% of reads in
the pico-sized fraction of BMK and Tara-Fract, respectively. In the micro-sized subsamples,
Tintinnina represented 56.0 and 15.0% of OTUs and 95.4 and 77.3% of reads, respectively.
Strobilidiina in BMK and Oligohymenophorea in Tara-Fract showed a distribution pattern across
fractions similar to Oligotrichida.
Venn diagrams were used to evaluate the OTU overlap between the different size-fractions
(Figure 1D). The BMK dataset showed a moderate overlap between the two smallest size
fractions in terms of OTUs (55 and 58% of OTUs in pico- and nano-sized subsamples,
respectively) and a remarkable overlap in terms of relative abundance (89 and 87% of reads in
pico- and nano-sized fractions corresponded to OTUs shared by both fractions). In contrast, most
OTUs from the micro-sized fraction were exclusive of this fraction (64%, representing 58.7% of
reads). OTUs shared by the three fractions represented less than 2% of reads for each fraction.
The Tara-Fract dataset, on the other hand, showed a remarkably high OTU overlap between all
fractions, especially in terms of amplicon abundance: over 94% of reads of each fraction
belonged to OTUs shared by the three planktonic fractions.

Overall, with the only exception of Tintinnina taxa, which are less represented in the smallest size
elcitrA
fractions, it appears that the pico-sized fraction provides in general a more diverse information
about ciliate community than nano- and micro-sized fractions. Therefore, our results support the
pico-sized fraction as an informative and reliable fraction to study ciliate diversity and ecology in
marine environments, at least to the same extent nano- and micro-sized fractions are, keeping in
mind that some taxa (i.e. Tintinnina) may be undersampled.
3.2. Ciliates in the global ocean
Eukaryotic HTS data from Malaspina (0.2 to 3 µm size fraction) and Tara (0.8 to 5 µm)
circumnavigation expeditions were analyzed in order to study Ciliophora distribution in offshore
waters from the global ocean. The datasets used here, MPN-SRF (99 samples), Tara-SRF (41
samples), MPN-DNA (40 samples), MPN-RNA (75 samples) and MPN-V9 (22 samples),
displayed 416, 609, 191, 1531 and 111 OTUs, respectively (Table 1). These belonged to all
Ciliophora classes, i.e. Heterotrichea, Karyorelictea, Armophorea, Litostomatea, Spirotrichea
(here divided in Euplotia, Hypotrichia, Licnophoridae, Oligotrichida, Strobilidiina and Tintinnina),
Colpodea, Oligohymenophorea, Nassophorea, Plagiopylea, Phyllopharyngea and Prostomatea,
as well as to the insertae sedis groups Protocruzia, Mesodiniidae and Cariacothrix. Many OTUs
detpeccA
belonged to environmental clades, i.e. clades exclusively composed by taxa detected by
molecular surveys. Nasso_1, Oligo5 and Phyll_4 (based on Boscaro et al., 2018) were the most
relevant environmental clades, representing 96.1%, 78.1% and 88.1% of Nassophorea,
Oligohymenophorea and Phyllopharyngea sequences, respectively. All datasets displayed a
comparable averaged similarity (from 90.8 to 93.1%) to formally described species, regardless of
the 18S gene barcode used or whether sequencing derived from DNA or RNA extracts.
3.2.1 Ciliate distribution in surface waters
MPN-SRF and Tara-SRF datasets were used to study ciliate horizontal distribution in surface
waters in all major regions of the non-polar global ocean (plus two samples from the Southern
Ocean; Fig. 2A). Ordination of samples on NMDS plots (Figure S1), followed by the ANOSIM
test, pointed to a weak influence of geographic oceanic regions on ciliate community composition
in Malaspina (R: 0.207, p-value: 0.0001), and moderate in Tara (R: 0.266, p-value: 0.0002).
Mantel test analyses revealed similar trends, with a weak correlation between abiotic
environmental parameters and ciliate community composition in Malaspina (R: 0.101 and p-
value: 0.0081) and a moderate correlation in Tara (R: 0.247 and p-value: 0.002). Based on
PERMANOVA tests, environmental data, longitude and latitude explained 18.4% of ciliate
community variation in MPN-SRF and 49% in Tara-SRF (Table S1). Temperature appeared as

the parameter that mostly explained ciliate community variation in Tara-SRF. The higher
elcitrA
influence of geographic regions and environmental parameters in Tara samples was driven by
the clear differentiation of Southern Ocean samples in terms of alfa diversity (Figure S2) and
community composition (Figure 2B). Indeed, when Southern Ocean samples were excluded from
Tara dataset, the effect of oceanic region on ciliate assemblages notably decreased (R: 0.198, p-
value: 0.0034, by ANOSIM test), as well as the correlation between biotic and abiotic data (R:
0.136, p-value: 0.04, by Mantel test), yielding results similar to Malaspina data.
Ciliophora community composition in terms of the OTUs present was notably similar along ocean
surface in both Malaspina and Tara datasets, either at Class (Figure 2B) and at lower taxonomic
ranks (Table S2). However, based on relative abundances, some regions in the Tara survey
exhibited clear particularities. First, ciliate assemblages from the Southern Ocean were distinct
from the general survey by having very low abundance of Oligohymenophorea and Nassophorea,
and high abundance of Strobilidiina. Second, samples from the Red Sea and Indian Ocean
displayed an increase in Colpodea, mostly due to two unique taxa: OTU_556 (100% to Colpoda
steinii, Colpodida) in the Red Sea, and OTU_565 (100% to Aristerostoma sp., Cyrtolophosidida)
in North and South Indian Ocean. Overall, Strombidiida (Oligotrichida), the environmental clade
Oligo5 (Oligohymenophorea), Nassophorea_X (Nassophorea), Cyrtophoria_1 (Phyllopharyngea),
detpeccA
Choreotrichida (Strobilidiina), Tintinnida (Tintinnina) and Mesodiniidae (only detected in Tara
dataset due to a deficient match of Mesodiniidae sequences with the reverse V4 primer) arose as
the most diverse and/or abundant Ciliophora clades in the ocean surface.
Finally, we aimed to study the distribution of specific taxa along the ocean surface. OTUs
detected in all oceanic regions (six regions in MPN-SRF and eight in Tara-SRF, Figure 2)
accounted for more than half of the Ciliophora abundance (66.4% in MPN-SRF and 63.3% in
Tara-SRF, representing 21.8% and 3.7% of OTUs) (Figure 2C). On the other side, ciliates
detected only in one region (at least in two samples) accounted for 8.8% of OTUs in Malaspina
and 14.1% in Tara, representing only 1.6% and 0.7% of the reads. Oligotrichida displayed the
highest number of ubiquitous OTUs (52.4% in MPN-SRF and 21.4% in Tara-SRF), while ubiquity
was also found in Oligohymenophorea, Tintinnina, Strobilidiina, Nassophorea, Phyllopharyngea,
Prostomatea and Mesodiniidae. We analyzed the 100 most abundant OTUs from MPN-SRF (V4
region) and Tara-SRF (V9 region) and linked the two 18S regions into a single phylotype (when
possible) based on BLAST results and on phylogenetic placements. We obtained an
unambiguous match for 14 phylotypes (Table S3), which explained 20.1% of Ciliophora
abundance in the whole survey (15.0% in Malaspina and 32.2% in Tara). Eight of them belonged
to Oligotrichida, three to Oligohymenophorea, two to Tintinnina and one to Prostomatea (Table
S3). Only two phylotypes displayed a 100% identity to a formally described species, specifically

The homogeneous distribution in the global ocean surface of the six more widespread phylotypes
within this list is shown in Figure 3.
3.2.2 Ciliates across the vertical scale
Vertical profiles, from surface to bathypelagic waters (up to 4000 m), were taken during the
Malaspina expedition, and the distribution of ciliates with depth was analyzed in three sequencing
datasets: MPN-DNA, MPN-RNA and MPN-V9 (Table 1). In all datasets, DCM arose as the most
diverse layer, and bathypelagic as the less diverse in Ciliophora community composition (Figure
4A). The two DNA approaches, i.e. MPN-DNA and MPN-V9, displayed a larger decrease in alfa
diversity in the aphotic zone than the RNA survey, in which the mesopelagic layer showed
diversity values slightly higher than at surface. Ciliophora communities from all vertical profiles
grouped according to depth layer in the NMDS ordination plot (Figure 4B). This clustering was
statistically supported by ANOSIM test in all datasets, both when samples were grouped in photic
(surface and DCM) versus aphotic (mesopelagic and bathypelagic) layers (R: 0.613 in MPN-
DNA, 0.694 in MPN-RNA and 0.614 in MPN-V9, p-value: 0.0001) or in the four layers (R: 0.578,
0.660 and 0.548, p-value: 0.0001). A more marked differentiation was observed between surface
detpeccA
and DCM assemblages (R: 0.736, 0.795 and 0.444, p-value: 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.0081) than
between mesopelagic and bathypelagic assemblages (R: 0.246, 0.482 and 0.237, p-value:
0.0006, 0.0001 and 0.0192). Based on the NMDS plot, photic ciliate communities showed a
higher cohesion than aphotic ciliate assemblages. No differences in alpha diversity and
taxonomic composition were seen in communities from the oxygen minimum zone or the deep
scattering layer as compared with the rest of mesopelagic samples (data not shown).
Oligotrichida and Oligohymenophorea were the dominant groups along the marine water column,
followed by Strobilidiina, Nassophorea and to a lesser extent Phyllopharyngea. A marked (and
consistent in the three datasets) variation in community composition was observed from surface
to deep layers (Figure 4C and Table S4). In the photic zone, Strombidiida (Oligotrichida), Oligo5
(Oligohymenophorea), Nassophorea_X (Nassophorea), Cyrtophoria_1 (Phyllopharyngea),
Choreotrichida (Strobilidiina) and Tintinnida (Tintinnina) were the most abundant and/or diverse
clades. Even though both photic layers displayed a similar community composition, an evident
increase in Oligo5 was seen in the DCM. Further noticeable differences in the photic zone
emerged at a Family level, such as an increase in Leegaardiellidae_B (Choreotrichida) and a
decrease in Tontoniidae_A (Strombidiida) with depth. The mesopelagic layer was characterized
by a marked increase in both diversity and abundance of Apostomatia (Oligohymenophorea) and
to a lesser extent of Scuticociliatia (Oligohymenophorea), coupled to a decrease in

Tontoniidae_B (Strombidiida) abundance. Finally, bathypelagic ciliate assemblages displayed
elcitrA
higher relevance of Scuticociliatia (mainly Pseudocohnilembidae and Philasterida) and Peritrichia
(Zoothamniidae) clades. In addition, a remarkable peak of Euplotia abundance was obtained in
the aphotic zone of the MPN-V9 dataset, especially in the bathypelagic layer (reaching up to
47.8% of Ciliophora abundance). This peak, undetected in the V4 surveys, was due to a unique
OTU displaying a 97.3% identity to Euplotes euryhalinus (Genbank accession number
KP297368). We also observed an increase of Protocruzia and to a lesser extent of Colpodea
richness and relative abundance with depth.
A moderate Ciliophora OTU overlap between layers was observed in all datasets (Figure 4D). In
particular, only 4.7, 12.2 and 8.1% of OTUs (in MPN-DNA, MPN-RNA and MPN-V9, respectively)
were detected in all layers, while 36.1, 36.0 and 37.8% of OTUs were exclusively found in one
layer (percentages refer to OTUs appearing at least twice in the dataset). IndVal analyses
revealed 25, 126 and 15 layer-related OTUs in MPN-DNA, MPN-RNA and MPN-V9 datasets,
respectively, and those with the highest IndVal values in each layer are shown in Table 2. Photic
layers gathered the majority of these depth-related OTUs (96.0% in MPN-DNA, 74.6% in MPN-
RNA and 86.7% in MPN-V9), mainly belonging to Oligotrichida (between 53.3 and 58.7% in the
three datasets) and to Oligohymenophorea (between 19.0 and 26.7%). The remaining depth-
detpeccA
related OTUs belonged to Nassophorea, Tintinnina, Euplotia, Prostomatea and Protocruzia
(Table S5). DNA and RNA vertical surveys exhibited a large OTU overlap (Figure S3), as only 20
OTUs out of 191 in MPN-DNA dataset (representing 6.6% of abundance) were not detected in
MPN-RNA.
4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Methodological considerations
There are several aspects that may influence the reliability of the results exposed here. First, it is
well known that the data obtained in metabarcoding assessments may be dependent on the
particular assay performed (Santoferrara, 2019). Here we combined surveys using different 18S
rDNA regions (V4 and V9), sequencing technologies (454 and Illumina), nucleic acid templates
(DNA and RNA) and OTU delineation (similarity, swarms and error correction). Also, sequencing
depth significantly differed between datasets (being quite low in some of them) given the broad
aim of the initial surveys. As a consequence, some ecological parameters of ciliate communities,
e.g. alfa diversity values (richness and H indices), were very different between datasets.
However, the general trends on size-fractionation, biodiversity, community structure and
biogeography were comparable among datasets, and this consistency indicates robustness of
our results on these issues. A second main concern is that biogeographic analyses from
This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

circumnavigation expeditions like Malaspina and Tara are based in a single station across wide
elcitrA
oceanographic transects, so overlooking seasonal or temporal variations as well as putative
particular conditions of the community sampled. This leads to the justified concern of up to which
extent these few samples can provide useful inferences for the global ocean. Our study includes
140 stations (from two different datasets) collected across a huge oceanic area, and the findings
that arise from these data provide a set of general patterns that can indeed be applied to shed
valuable light on the diversity and biogeography of marine ciliates at a global scale.
4.2. Ciliate detection across fractions
Although pico-sized ciliates have not been described to date, Ciliophora sequences have been
repeatedly detected in the pico-sized fraction by HTS surveys (Cheung et al., 2008; de Vargas et
al., 2015; López-García, Rodríguez-Valera, Pedrós-Alió, & Moreira, 2001; Not et al., 2009;
Sørensen et al., 2012). Our results indicate that these sequences, somehow considered
artifactual, are indeed providing useful information about the diversity and community
composition of marine ciliates. Several hypotheses have arisen to explain the presence of ciliate
sequences in the pico-sized fraction: a) ciliate cell breakage during filtration (Cheung et al., 2008;
Not et al., 2009; Terrado, Vincent, & Lovejoy, 2009); b) membrane flexibility in ciliate cells,
detpeccA
allowing them to pass through small filter pores (Cheung et al.; 2008); and c) the collection of
extracellular DNA derived from non-living ciliates (Not et al., 2009; Schiaffino et al., 2016;
Sørensen et al., 2012; Sørensen, Daugbjerg, & Richardson, 2013). The wide across-fractions
sharing in Tara-Fract, where over 94% of Ciliophora abundance in each size fraction
corresponded to OTUs detected in the three fractions, supports cell breakage as the most
plausible hypothesis primarily explaining the Ciliophora signal in pico-sized subsamples. The
strong ciliate signal in the MPN-RNA dataset is also favoring this hypothesis, as extracellular
RNA is very labile and therefore the RNA signal likely derives from alive cells (broken and
collected in the smallest size fraction). A similar high fraction-sharing was not observed in BMK,
probably due to a combination of lower sequencing effort (Table 1) and the different setup to
sample the microplankton. Thus, the scarcity of non-Tintininna sequences in BMK microplankton
samples may be explained by a higher cell flexibility and breakage imposed by the plankton net
tow. Extracellular DNA as the source of Ciliophora signal in the three fractions is likely the least
supported hypothesis, since this would imply the existence of high amounts of extracellular DNA
adhered to differently sized particles or aggregates that would be retained in filters of different
pore size (0.2/0.8, 3/5 and 20μm). Thus, our results do not agree with the statements of
Sørensen et al. (2013) that considered extracellular DNA as the main source of ciliate signal in
the pico-sized fraction.

Tintinnina and Oligotrichida (both belonging to Spirotrichea class) were the main groups
elcitrA
responding to fractioning in both coastal (BMK) and offshore (Tara-Fract) samples. In particular,
Tintinnina were mainly found in micro-sized subsamples, while Oligotrichida dominated in the
smallest fractions. This agrees with previous observations by Grattepanche et al. (2016). This
differential distribution across fractions can be explained by specific morphological features.
Tintinnina cells possess an external rigid structure (lorica) generally rather large (>100 µm), which
may facilitate their retention in 20 µm pore size filters. On the other hand, Oligotrichida are
smaller, naked and non-rigid ciliates, which make them more sensitive to cell breakage or more
flexible to pass through small filter pores.
In summary, our results indicate that not only cell size but also morphological features may drive
protist detection in different planktonic fractions. In ciliates, our findings support the pico-sized
fraction as an informative fraction when a sequential filtering process is applied to samples, at
least as informative as larger sized fractions. The pico-sized fraction showed a higher tendency to
gather diversity compared to micro-sized subsamples (Figure 1A) and a greater community
cohesion than nano-sized ones (Figure 1B, Tara-Fract panel). Nevertheless, since the pico-sized
fraction does not optimally detect Tintinnina, a complementary analysis of both pico- (instead of
nano-) and micro-sized fractions, or a unique filtering on 0.2 to 0.8 µm pore size filters (e.g. Pitsch
detpeccA
et al., 2019; Stock et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2017) arise as the best choices to
fully assess marine Ciliophora diversity by HTS when microbial biomass is collected by filtration.
4.3. Ciliates in the open ocean surface
Analyses of HTS data from global surface waters indicated a limited influence of oceanic region
to ciliate community composition. Thus, planktonic ciliates formed rather homogeneous
assemblages along the vast tropical and temperate areas studied here (Atlantic, Pacific, and
Indian Oceans, Southern Australian Bight, and Mediterranean and Red seas). The largest
community differentiation was found in the few samples from the Southern Ocean, as already
reported by Gimmler et al. (2016), and in line with other surveys targeting non-loricate
Oligotrichea (Oligotrichida and Strobilidiina) (Agatha et al. 2011) or Tintinnina (Dolan & Pierce,
2013; Santoferrara et al., 2018). This could be attributed to the sudden decrease of water
temperature at the Polar Front, which likely led to community differentiation by adaptation to
lower temperatures, coupled with the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Griffiths, 2010), which
may act as a colonization barrier, preventing dispersion from temperate regions. Although no
Arctic samples were included in the present study, a similar pattern would be expected for boreal
ciliate communities. Indeed, a global trend of lower microbial diversity in the polar regions than in
temperate and tropical zones has been recently reported (Ibarbalz et al., 2019), in addition to the
This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

higher ciliate endemism described in boreal marine regions (e.g. Dolan & Pierce, 2013;
elcitrA
Santoferrara et al., 2018).
Results exposed here also confirm previous reports indicating that the most abundant taxa tend
to be more widespread than the scarcer ones (de Vargas et al., 2015; Santoferrara et al., 2014).
Here, up to 66.4% of Ciliophora abundance in MPN-SRF and 63.3% in Tara-SRF (81.1%
excluding Southern Ocean samples) corresponded to ciliate taxa present in all oceanic regions
(Figure 2C), thus supporting cosmopolitanism of the most abundant taxa in the ocean surface.
This fact was also evidenced by the global distribution of a few abundant phylotypes retrieved in
the two datasets (Figure 3, Table S3). The existence of a widely distributed core ciliate
community therefore suggests a high level of specialization of these core taxa to the typical
oligotrophic conditions of open ocean surface waters.
In the context of microbial biogeography, the moderate endemicity model (Foissner, 2006)
proposed that about 30% of morphological and molecular suprageneric taxa might be endemic
species. Here, regional endemic Ciliophora (those appearing at least twice in a unique oceanic
region) were 8.8% of total OTUs in Malaspina and 14.1% in Tara. These results indicate that
open ocean surface waters harbor a lower level of endemicity than the 30% proposed by the
moderate endemicity model, or the 33% regional endemism found for aloricate Oligotrichea by
detpeccA
Agatha (2011). Comparing with the previous report, we found that only 6.6% of aloricate
Oligotrichea OTUs in MPN-SRF and 10.2% in Tara-SRF can be considered as regional endemic.
The higher regional endemism reported by Agatha (2011) could be attributed to the lower
capacity of detection of morphological versus molecular surveys, coupled with the expected
higher endemism in coastal environments than in the open ocean. Molecular approaches have
also limitations evaluating diversity, such as inconsistencies between clustering methods or, in
some cases, the low resolution of the 18S rDNA for species delimitation (Santoferrara et al.,
2018). However, the same authors stated that molecular and morphological methods agreed at
the genus level, thus supporting this taxonomic rank in biogeographic studies. Our data, based
on OTUs with similarity >98% to described species, confirmed the cosmopolitanism of all genera
stated as globally distributed by Agatha (2011) except Paratontonia and Lohmaniella (not found
here). Genera considered restricted to the Northern hemisphere, such as Cyrtostrombidium,
Novistrombidium, Spirotontonia and Varistrombidium, were also found in the Southern
hemisphere, while the distribution of Lynnella was expanded from the North Pacific, to the
Atlantic and South Indian Oceans.
Finally, we want to highlight the high occurrence of Pseudocohnilembus persalinus
(Oligohymenophorea, Scuticociliatia) along the ocean surface (Table S3). This is one of the many
scuticociliate species able to become opportunistic histophagous parasites of fishes that may

elcitrA
Pseudocohnilembus persalinus has been reported in the freshwater rainbow trout (Jones,
Prosperi-Porta, & LaPatra, 2010) and the marine olive flounder (Kim et al., 2004), both
commercially relevant fishes.
4.4. From the surface to the deep-sea
Ciliates have been repeatedly reported inhabiting the water column from surface to bathypelagic
depths (Countway et al., 2007; Giner et al., 2020; López-García et al., 2001; Not, Gausling,
Azam, Heidelberg, & Worden, 2007; Silver et al., 1984), marine sediments (Bik et al., 2012;
Hausmann, Hülsmann, Polianski, Schade, & Weitere, 2002) and particular deep habitats like
hydrothermal vents (Sauvadet et al., 2010), cold methane seeps (Takishita, Kakizoe, Yoshida, &
Maruyama, 2010) and hypersaline basins (Alexander et al., 2009; Stock et al., 2012; Stock et al.,
2013). However, only few studies have focused on planktonic deep-sea ciliates and its vertical
distribution in the open ocean. Among them, some reported their presence and abundance
(Agusti et al., 2015; Silver et al., 1984; Tanaka & Rassoulzadegan, 2002) while others described
(to a lesser or greater extent) its community composition (Grattepanche et al., 2015;
Grattepanche et al., 2016; Sohrin et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2017). Our results
detpeccA
agree with previous findings and support the notion that ciliates are not only present in the deep-
sea but also play an active role, as indicated by the RNA signal obtained here in mesopelagic
and bathypelagic layers and in previous reports (Hu et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2018; Takishita et al.,
2010). Indeed, relevant trophic roles have been attributed to ciliates as grazers of bacteria and
nano-flagellates, parasites of fishes and invertebrates, and food source for small metazoans
(Silver et al., 1984; Sohrin et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2019; Tanaka & Rassoulzadegan, 2002; Zhao
et al., 2017).
Consistent with previous reports for the eukaryotic community (Countway et al., 2007; Giner et
al., 2020) and for ciliates assemblages (Grattepanche et al., 2015; Silver et al., 1984; Zhou et al.,
2017), our data showed an evident differentiation of Ciliophora communities along the water
column. Ciliate assemblages grouped according to light availability (photic versus aphotic layers)
and also to the main four layers of the water column: surface, DCM, mesopelagic and
bathypelagic, as also reported by Zhou et al. (2017). Furthermore, between 13 and 15% of OTUs
in each dataset appeared as indicators of a specific layer. With respect to alpha diversity
estimates for ciliates, both DNA and RNA surveys showed the DCM as the most diverse layer
and the bathypelagic as the least diverse layer. These results are in line with most previous
findings (Christaki et al., 2011; Pitta et al. 2011; Sun et al., 2019; Zhao et al. 2017). Grattepanche
This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

et al. (2016) reported higher ciliate diversity in the mesopelagic (850 m depth) than in photic
elcitrA
samples, but these findings were based on a single deep sample.
Our results on ciliate community composition along the depth gradient are also in line with recent
studies (Sun et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2017), all supporting Spirotrichea (Oligotrichida,
Strobilidiina and Tintinnina), Oligohymenophorea and Nassophorea as the most diverse and
abundant groups in the global ocean. It is noteworthy the consistency between our results, based
on pico-sized subsamples, and those from studies where samples were collected by a unique
filtration on 0.22 µm (Zhou et al., 2017) or 0.8 µm (Sun et al., 2019) pore size filters. These
studies also reported an increase of Apostomatia and Scuticociliatia clades in the aphotic layers.
Apostomatia are primarily symbionts or parasites of invertebrate groups like shrimps and
cephalopods (Lynn, 2008; Soudienne et al., 2016), while Scuticociliatia, typically considered
bacterivores, also harbor many species able to parasite fishes (Lynn, 2008). Our results revealed
a clear preference of Tontoniidae_A and Tontoniidae_B (Oligotrichida, Strombidiida) to the photic
zone, a fact probably explained by the spread mixotrophy within many genera of these clades like
Laboea, Pseudotontonia, or Spirotontonia (Lynn, 2008). In addition, the peak of Zoothamniidae in
the bathypelagic layer corresponded to the free-floating Zoothamnium pelagicum (Gómez, 2017),
an oligotrophic bacterivorous species able to actively move throughout the water column.
detpeccA
The peak of Euplotia in the aphotic zone of the MPN-V9 dataset was surprising since no Euplotes
species has been previously reported as dominant in marine surveys. Also, Euplotia OTUs were
practically absent in V4 surveys, most likely due to large insertions in the V4 region of most
species, which prevents their PCR amplification prior HTS. The single V9 Euplotia OTU was
detected in 5 out of 6 stations at all depths, being particularly prominent in the bathypelagic layer,
where it reached over 40% of Ciliophora abundance. Euplotia members are free-living, flattened
cells possessing cirrus (composite tuft of somatic cilia forming leg-like structures; Lynn, 2008) in
the ventral side of the cell, what allows them to crawl and graze over substrates such as marine
snow, i.e. sinking particles from surface layers to the deep-sea. As far as we know, our findings
are the first suggesting the pelagic deep-sea as a favorable environment for ciliate species
adapted to live on substrates, probably feeding on bacteria and small eukaryotes that conform
the marine snow (Alldredge & Silver, 1988; Kiørboe, 2003). Overall, the present study provides
new data suggesting ciliates as well-integrated organisms in the understudied trophic web of the
deep ocean. Our findings point to deep-sea ciliates as symbionts of various marine groups (e.g.
fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods), and grazers of prokaryotes and small eukaryotes in the water
column and in marine aggregates.
4.5. Highlighting the unknown
This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

A low sequence similarity of marine ciliate OTUs against formally described species was
elcitrA
observed, about 90-93% similarity on average in the different datasets, fact that highlights the
poor knowledge on ciliate diversity in marine environments (Liu et al., 2017). This is especially
relevant in the open ocean, as exemplified by the large number of OTUs belonging to
environmental clades, like Nasso_1, Oligo5 and Phyll_4 (Boscaro et al., 2018), among others.
Moreover, this sequence novelty was more noticeable in deep waters (Figure S4), indicating that
more unknowns exist in the undersampled and understudied deep ocean. The exposed findings
highlight not only the need of further taxonomic efforts by the scientific community, but also the
need of funding taxonomic efforts by public agencies, as there will be no advances on taxonomy
without taxonomists funding.

ciliate species by layer in the MPN-DNA, MPN-RNA and MPN-V9 vertical profiles.
Table S1. Results of PERMANOVA tests. It shows to what extent longitude, latitude and
environmental parameters explain the variations in ciliate community composition from MPN-SRF
and Tara-SRF. Degree of freedom is 1 in all cases.
Table S2. A detailed report of the percentage of OTUs and their relative read abundance within
Order and Family taxonomic levels for surface samples of each oceanic region of the MPN-SRF
and the Tara-SRF datasets. NAO: North Atlantic Ocean, SAO: South Atlantic Ocean, SIO: South
Indian Ocean, SAB: South Australian Bight, SPO: South Pacific Ocean, NPO: North Pacific
Ocean.
Table S3. List of the 14 most abundant and widely distributed phylotypes in the ocean surface
retrieved by linking V4 and V9 sequences from MPN-SRF and Tara-SRF datasets.
