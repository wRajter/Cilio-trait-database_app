Résumé
Le nombre et la distribution des ciliés psammobiotiques des rivages sablon­
neux du Sud du Pays de Galles sont étudiés ici. La variation en nombre et en
espèces montre des différences considérables entre les deux rives de la Baie
de Swansea. Les populations de ces rivages manifestent un accroissement lié à la
température alors que les ciliés se trouvant à Nicholaston semblent être indépen­
dants de la température. Cette différence dans la dynamique des populations
est attribuée aux différences d’exposition à l’action des vagues.
Introduction
The psammobiotic cillâtes of British shores have been studied by
El Maghraby and Perkins (1956), Lackey and Lackey (1963) and
Hartwig and Parker (1977). Numerically, the cillâtes are found to
be the most abundant animal phylum in the marine sandy environ­
ment and Fenchel (1969) considered them to be, on occasions, the
most important in terms of relative metabolic activity. This paper
presents a study of the ecology of psammobiotic cillâtes : in particular,
their variation in numbers during a twelve month period.
Methods
The study was carried out on two sandy shores of the South
coast of the Gower Peninsula, South Wales (Figs. 1, 2) over a period
of twelve months. Quantitative samples were obtained at one station
on each shore. The Swansea Bay sampling site is located at a position
between Mean High Water Neaps and Mid Tide Level (M.T.L.) where
the water table is constantly at the surface. At Nicholaston, the
sampling site is located at M.T.L. ; here, the water table is at the
surface only immediately ahead of a rising or falling tide. Sand
samples were obtained using four ’Perspex’ (Polymethacrylate) co-
rers of 30cm length and external diameter 40mm, internal diameter
36mm (supplied by G.H. Bloore Ltd.). At one end, the internal edge
was bevelled to make entry into the sediment easier and reduce
disturbance. Negative pressure, applied by sucking with the mouth

at the upper end as the corers
were gently pushed by hand into
the sediment, further reduced
disturbance. The top of the
corer was sealed with a rubber
bung after it had been inserted
to a depth of 20cm. The tube
was then ’broken’ from the sedi­
ment by pushing it to an angle
of approximately 50° to the ver­
tical, it was then lifted out and

sealed with a second bung at the
lower end. As the tube is trans-
parant, any failure to sample
properly could be seen and the
process repeated if necessary.
Four cores were taken at each BRISTOL CHANNEI
station, arranged at the corners
of a 25cm square.
Cores were returned to the
laboratory where the contents
were allowed to slide out under
gravity, in order to disturb the
core as little as possible. The
bottom 6cm of sediment was dis­
carded and the remaining 14cm
length split into seven sections
at 2cm intervals. From each of
these sections, a 2g sample of Fig. 1
South-West Britain, showing the location
sediment was removed and sub-

sequently analysed for organic carbon content, using the method
of Gaudette et al. (1974). The remaining sediment was subjected
to Uhlig’s sea-water ice technique for the extractions of ciliates
(Uhlig, 1968). Identifications were made from living and stained
specimens. Other parameters measured include por volume
(Bruce, 1928), porosity (Webb, 1958), Redox potential (Fenchel and
Riedl, 1970), hydrogen ion activity (Fenchel and Riedl, 1970) and
mean grain size (Folk and Ward, 1957). Electrometric parameters
were measured using a Pye Unicam Model 293 pH meter fitted with
electrodes supplied by Russell ph Ltd. Mean grain size was measured
using 21 half height, standard brass sieves of 200mm diameter in a
quarter phi interval series, the coarsest being —1.00 0, the finest
+4.00 0. The grain size data were analysed using an IGL 1904S at
University College Swansea Computer Centre.
Results
All statistical parameters referring to the sediment are those of
Folk and Ward (1957). The Swansea Bay sediment is a medium
fine sand (Mz 2.03 0 = 0.25mm), moderately sorted (0 I 0.56 0),
with a nearly symmetrical distribution of fine and coarse grades
(Sk I + 0.01) and an indication of better sorting in the central
region of the distribution (Kg 1.12). The sediment from Nicholaston
is a medium sand (Mz 1.57 0 = 0.34mm) well to moderately well
sorted (0 0.50 0), with a nearly symmetrical distribution of fine and
coarse grades (Sk I — 0.08) ; the distribution is approximately normal
(Kg 1.05).
The organic carbon content of the Swansea site to a depth
of 14cm over the sampling period had a mean of 0.07 p. 100 + 0.03
with a range of values between zero and 0.17 p. 100. Higher values
((0.25 — 0.46 p. 100) were due to the occasional presence of coal par­
ticles; values greater than 0.17 p. 100 which coincided with the
presence of black particles were discarded. During the sampling
period, the amount of organic carbon did not follow a clear seasonal
pattern. At Nicholaston, the mean organic carbon content was
0.05 p. 100 + 0.02 with a range of values between zero and 0.13 p. 100;
coal particles were not observed at this site. No seasonal cycle in
organic carbon content was observed.
The pore volume at Swansea Bay had a range of values between
29 p. 100 and 49 p. 100 with a mean of 42.7 p. 100 + 3.1 and at
Nicholaston the range was between 33 p. 100 and 46 p. 100 with a
mean of 39.6 p. 100 + 3.5. The porosity immediately adjacent to
the sampling cores in Swansea Bay showed a range of values between
17.8 p. 100 and 24.5 p. 100, with a mean value of 20.3 p. 100 + 1.1.
At Nicholaston, the range of values lay between 15.7 p. 100 and 26.7
p. 100, with a mean value of 18.3 p. 100 + 1.2.
The redox potential discontinuity (R.P.D.) occurs between the
values of +200mv and —lOOmv (Fenchel and Riedl, 1970) ; it is
considered to begin at +200mv or less. At the Swansea Bay site,
the redox potential varied between +398mv at the surface and
—70mv at 14cm depth; the R.P.D. was observed to make a migration

period (Pearson correlation coefficient r == 0.725, 9 d.f., 5 p. 100)
being found at approximately 7cm in June 1979. At Nicholaston
the redox potentials had a range of values between -|-438mv and
+ 78mv at 14cm depth. However the value usually remained around
+398mv throughout this depth no matter what the time of year.
The pH of the sediment at the Swansean Bay site had a range
of values between 6.6 and 8.1 units. The profile was generally one
of increasing pH with depth. At Nicholaston, the pH had a range
of values between 6.6 and 7.9 units, being either constant or increasing
with depth.
The water table at the Swansea Bay site is always at the surface
regardless of the state of the tide. The slope of the beach is gentle
and at the site position there is a layer of impervious clay at a depth
of 30-40cm. The station is considered to be in the zone of saturation
(Salvat, 1966, 1967). At Nicholaston, the water table lies below the
sampling depth at the time of low water. The slope of the beach
is steeper than that of Swansea Bay and, at the site position, there is
a layer of larger particles of the gravel grade (Folk, 1954), measuring
approximately 5-10cm, at a depth of 40cm. The water table is at

the surface shorewards of rising and falling tides. The site is
considered to be in the zone of resurgence (Salvat, 1966, 1967).
Changes in ciliate populations (see Table 1)
A comparison of these figures with those of previous authors
shows that they are within the same range for the intertidal area:

The range of values obtained for the Nicholaston site (3.4 X 103
— 2.40 X 106) is greater than that for Swansea Bay (5.75 X 104 —
7.09 X 105) due to a single core taken at Nicholaston during October
1979:

12-14 17 0 1 0
The results for core I give an adjusted value of 9.534 X 106mr2,
providing the highest estimate for any core taken at either Swansea
Bay or Nicholaston.
The total number of cillâtes at Swansea Bay (Fig. 3) reaches its
maximum during the warmer months of the year and shows a
positive correlation with the averaged maximum air temperature
(Figs. 4, 5) for the thirty days preceding a sampling date (r = 0.634,
9 d.f., 5 p. 100). The highest number of ciliates was recorded in
February; a second maximum occurred in July coinciding with the
temperature maximum. The minimum number occurred in March,
corresponding with a low temperature. The high number of ciliates
obtained in February corresponded with a sharp rise in temperature
during the 30 days preceding the sampling date. The average
maximum temperature for February 1979 for that period was 5.3°C
whilst, in February 1980, the corresponding temperature was 9.3°G.
At Nicholaston, the total number of ciliates was variable showing

several maxima, none of which coincided with the maximum in
temperature (Fig. 6). The numbers did not show a correlation with
temperature.
The mean population depth of these populations was calculated
by taking the number of ciliates at a given depth interval, multiplying
by the actual depth in centimetres and then dividing each product
by the total number of ciliates for that core. A correlation was
found between mean population depth and temperature at Swansea
Bay (r = 0.796, 9 d.f. 1 p. 100), i.e. the population is found at a shall­
ower depth with increasing temperature (Fig. 7). The percentage

with temperature (r = 0.634, 9 d.f. 5 p. 100). At Nicholaston there
was no observable relationship between mean population depth or

FAMILY TRACHELOCERCIDAE
The members of this family, comprising the three genera Trache-
locerca, Tracheloraphis and Trachelonema account for 32.9 p. 100 of
all the ciliates at the Swansea Bay site. The mean value for the
sampling period was 1.24 X 105nr~2 with a range of values between
8.0 X 103 and 6.42 X 105m~2. The numbers of Trachelocercidae show
several peaks (Fig. 9); there is a correlation between numbers and
average maximum air temperature (r = 0.705, 9 d.f., 5 p. 100). The
peaks occur in September, June and February. The mean population
depth shows a significant relationship with temperature (r = 0.757,
9 d.f., 1 p. 100) : the population is nearer the surface during the
warmer months. The percentage of the population occurring in the
top 2cm of sediment also shows a significant relationship with tempe­
rature (r = 0.640, 9 d.f., 5 p. 100). At Nicholaston, the Tracheloceri-
dae accounted for 20.4 p. 100 of the total ciliate numbers (ignoring
the exceptional Core 1 of 17.10.79) or 2.1 p. 100 if this is included
in the calculation. The mean value for the sampling period was
6.5 X 103m~2 with a range of values between zero and 4.6 X 104m-2.
The numbers show no correlation with average maximum air tempe­
rature (Fig. 10), neither does the mean population depth nor the
percentage occurring in the top 2cm of sediment.

This species is present on occasion in quite large numbers at
the Swansea Bay site, whilst it is absent from the Nicholaston site.
At Swansea Bay, it accounts for 5.3 p. 100 of the total ciliate popu­
lation with a range of values between zero and 1.49 X 105m-2 and
a mean of 2.0 X 104m-2. The numbers show no correlation with
average air temperature being absent from the sampling site during
the warmest months. The mean population depth shows a correla­
tion with temperature (r = 0.713, 8 d.f., 5 p. 100) and the percentage
occurring in the top 2cm of sediment also correlates with temperature
(r = 0.699, 8 d.f., 5 p. 100).

At the Swansea Bay site, this ciliate accounts for 14.7 p. 100 of

between numbers and temperature although there is an observable
peak during September otherwise, the trend is one of increase during
the survey. There is a correlation between mean population depth
and temperature (r = 0.761, 9 d.f., 1 p. 100) and also between the
proportion occurring in the surface layers of sediment and tempera­
ture (r == 0.615, 9 d.f., 5 p. 100). At Nicholaston, this species accounts
for 1.4 p. 100 (or 0.1 p. 100) with a range of values between zero and
6 X 103m-2 and a mean of 4.4 X 102m-2.

account for 10.8 p. 100 of the total ciliate population. The range
of density values lay between zero and 3,35 X 105m~2 with a mean
value of 4.10 X 104m-2. The variation in numbers and temperature
are related and show a significant correlation (r = 0.751, 9 d.f., 1 p.
100). There is a correlation between mean population depth and tem­
perature (r=0.830, 9 d.f., 1 p. 100) and also between the percentage
occuring in the top 2cm and temperature (r=0.674, 9 d.f., 5 p. 100).
At Nicholson, this group accounts for 13.2 p. 100 (or 1.8 p. 100) of the
total. The range of values lay between zero and 4.0X104m-2 with a
mean value for the survey of 4.22X103m-2. There is no correlation
between temperature and numbers, although this group is absent in
the cooler months. Neither the mean population depth or the per­
centage occurring in the top 2cm of sediment correlate with tem­
perature.
TRACHELONEMA OLIGOSTRIATA Raikov, 1962
This species accounts for fewer than 0.3 p. 100 of the ciliates
observed at the Swansea Bay site. The range of values lay between
zero and 1.8 X lO4m~2 with a mean value of 1.27 X 103m-2. This
species is present for nine months of the sampling period, producing
a peak in numbers during July; however, there is no correlation
between numbers and temperature, nor is there a significant relation­
ship between temperature and either mean population depth or the
percentage occurring in the top 2cm. At Nicholaston, this species
makes up 0.3 p. 100 (or less than 0.1 p. 100) of the ciliate population
and occurs in only three months of the sampling period.
FAMILY LOXODIDAE
For the purposes of this report the Loxodidae is taken to consist
of the genera Remanella, Kentrophoros and Ciliofaurea. At the
Swansea Bay site, individuals of the genera Kentrophoros and Cilio-
faurea occur occasionally whilst the genus Remanella occurred regu­
larly throughout the sampling period and accounted for over 99 p.
100 of the family. The Loxodidae accounted for 20.0 p. 100 of the
ciliates recorded at the Swansea Bay site with a mean of 7.57 X 104
m~2 and a range of values between zero and 5.32 X 105m-2. The
Loxodidae show a temporal relationship rather than a correlation
with temperature : the regression with time is significant (r = 0.844,
10 d.f., 0.1 p. 100) (Fig. 11). The mean population depth of the
Loxodidae (Fig. 12) does not correlate with average maximum air
temperature, but the percentage of the population occurring in the
top 2cm of sediment does correlate with temperature (r = 0.631,
9 d.f., 5 p. 100). At Nicholaston, the Loxodidae are an unimportant
constituent of the total ciliate population and account for 0.2 p. 100
(or fewer than 0.1 p. 100).

FAMILY GELEIDAE
The only members of this family encountered belong to the genus
Gelea. At Swansea Bay, they account for 9.0 p. 100 of the total
population. During the survey period, they had a mean density
of 3.42 X 104m~2 with a range of values between zero and 3.57 X 105
m~2. This family does not show a significant relationship with tem­
perature but there is an apparent temporal increase (Fig. 13). How­
ever, the mean population depth (Fig. 14) does correlate with tempe­
rature (r = —0.869, 9 d.f., 0.1 p. 100) ; the percentage occuring in
the top 2cm of sediment also correlates with temperature (r = 0.746,
9 d.f., 1 p. 100). At Nicholaston, the occurrence of Geleidae is rare;
during the course of the survey none were recorded.
GELEI A NIGRICEPS Kahl, 1933
This species was encountered occasionally at Swansea Bay, it
was not recorded from either site during the course of the survey.
FAMILY COLEPIDAE
All members of the Colepidae that were encountered during the
survey belonged to the genus Coleps. At Swansea Bay, this family
accounts for 11 p. 100 of the total cibate population. The range
of density values lay between zero and 5.35 X 105m-2 with a mean
value of 7.35 X 104m-2. The numbers show a significant correlation
with temperature (r = 0.786, 9 d.f., 1 p. 100). Mean population
depth shows a correlation with temperature (r = —0.923, 8 d.f.,
0.1 p. 100) and the percentage of the population occurring in the top
2cm of sediment also correlates with temperature (r = 0.702, 8 d.f.,
5 p. 100). At Nicholaston, the Colepidae account for 5.7 p. 100 (or
0.8 p. 100) of the total population. The range of values lay between
zero and 4.9 X l O4m~2 with a mean of 1.8 X 103m-2. This family
was present in only the six warmer months of the sampling period.
COLEPS PÜLCHER Spiegel, 1926
At Swansea Bay, this species accounts for 2.6 p. 100 of the
cibate population. The range of density values lay between zero
and 1.37 X 105m~2 with a mean value for the survey of 1.00 X 104m-2.
There is no correlation between numbers and temperature (Fig. 15),
although the mean population depth, does correlate with temperature
(r = —0.893, 8 d.f., 1 p. 100), being nearer the surface during the
warmer months; there is no correlation between the percentage oc­
curring in the top 2cm and the temperature. At Nicholaston, C. pul-
cher is comparatively rare and was present during two months of
the survey in low numbers (7.5 X 102m~~2) on both occasions.

This species accounts for 8.8 p. 100 of the ciliates at Swansea

mean of 3.35 X 104-2. The numbers (Fig. 16) show a correlation
with temperature (r = 0.727, 7 d.f., 5 p. 100). The mean population
depth also correlates with temperature (r = —0.739, 7 d.f., 5 p. 100)
as does the percentage of the population in the surface layers (r =
0.744, 7 d.f., 5 p. 100). At Nicholaston, this ciliate accounts for 5.3 p.
100 (or 0.7 p. 100) of the total ciliate population. The range of values
lay between zero and 4.40 X 104m-2 with a mean for the survey of
1.69 X 103m-2. This species was present during six months of the
sampling period.

FAMILY AMPHILEPTIDAE
LITONOTUS ANGUILLA Kahl, 1930
This species did not occur at the Swansea Bay site during the
survey. At Nicholaston it accounts for 0.9 p. 100 (or 0.1 p. 100) and
occurred during three months of the sampling period.
FAMILY SCAPHIDIODONTIDAE
CH1LODONTOPS1S VO RAX (Stokes, 1894)
This species accounts for fewer than 0.1 p. 100 of the ciliates at
Swansea Bay and at Nicholaston 3.2 p. 100 (or 0.4 p. 100), occuring
in four months of the sampling period.
FAMILY PLEURONEMATIDAE
All the members of this family found during the survey belong
to the genus Plcuronema. At Swansea Bay, they accounted for
5.8 p. 100 of all the ciliates encountered. The range of density values
was between zero and 2.34 X 105m-2 with a mean of 2.19 X 104m-2.
The numbers (Fig. 17) do not correlate with temperature, neither
does the mean population depth nor the percentage occurring in the
top 2cm of sediment. At Nicholaston, they account for 11.7 p. 100
(or 1.6 p. 100). The numbers do not correlate with temperature
neither does the mean population depth or the percentage occurring
in the top 2cm of sediment.

PSAMMOBIOTIC CI LI ATE S 233
FAMILY CONDYLOSTOMATIDAE
This family comprises the genus Condylostoma for the purposes
of this survey. At Swansea Bay, they account for fewer than 0.1 p.
100 of the total ciliate population, a range of values between zero
and 2.0 X 103m-2 with a mean value of 1.9 X 102m-2. They were
present in only six months of the sampling period and then consisted
of few animals.
At Nicholaston, the Condylostomatidae account for 7.0 p. 100 (or
1.0 p. 100) of the total number of ciliates. The range of values
was between zero and 2.56 X 104m-2 with a mean value for the survey
of 2.23 X 103m-2. They do not correlate with temperature for num­
bers, mean population depth or percentage occurring in the top
2cm.
FAMILY PERITROMIDAE
Other species besides Peritromus faurei Kahl, 1932 occurred
during the survey but only as individuals.
PERITROMUS F AUREI Kahl, 1932
This species accounts for 0.3 p. 100 of the ciliates of Swansea
Bay being found in low numbers during three months of the sampling
period. At Nicholaston it accounts for 0.9 p. 100 (or 0.1 p. 100), again
occurring in only three months of the sampling period.
FAMILY EUPLOTIDAE
This family consists of the genera: Euplotes, Diophrys, Disco-
cephalus and Uronychia. Of these, Euplotes is the most important
and accounts for over 99 p. 100 at Swansea Bay and 90 p. 100 at
Nicholaston.
EUPLOTES BALTEATUS (Dujardin, 1841)
The genus Euplotes was on occasion so numerous that they
were counted using a Sedgwick-Rafter counting chamber. At Swan­
sea Bay, this species accounted for 4.9 p. 100 of the total number
of ciliates encountered and occurred in six months of the sampling
period, becoming particularly abundant in the latter part of this
period. At Nicholaston, it accounted for 19.9 p. 100 (or 88.8 p. 100)
of the total ciliate population. It occurred in eight months of the
period but showed no correlation with temperature (Fig. 18). The
mean population depth does not correlate with temperature but the
proportion of the population occurring in the surface layers does
(r = 0.852, 4 d.f., 5 p. 100).

of the total number of ciliates see Table 2.

DISCUSSION
Since Fauré-Fremiet (1950, 1951, 1958) first based an ecological
classification of benthis interstitial cillâtes on their occurrence in
beaches of particular grain size it has been possible to place some
ciliates in more than one of the three categories Microporal, Mesoporal
or Euryporal (Hartwig 1973). Fauré-Fremiet (loc. cit.) considered that
the species typical of the microporal group are characterised by a
long and flattened shape, thigmotactic behaviour, elongate caudal
regions, a creeping or jerky movement and by being generally fragile.
Mesoporal species are found in coarser sand and the Euryporal
species may be found in either Micro- or Mesoporal sands.
The shores at Swansea Bay and Nicholaston are both within the
range described for microporal (between 0.4 and 0.12mm) and there­
fore might be expected to support a similar ciliate fauna when, in
fact, not only do they have a different fauna but also a different
ecology. This difference in ecology is explicable by a consideration
of the relative exposure of the two shores.
The two sampling sites are characterised by a moderately sorted
sediment with a nearly symmetrical distribution and no excess
of coarse or fine grades. The Swansea Bay sediments are leptokurtic :
that is, the central region is better sorted than the ’tails’, which
suggests that the sediment is tending to become bimodal (Folk and
Ward 1957). The Nicholaston sediments are mesokurtic: that is, the
central region is as well sorted as the ’tails’ and they are thus
unimodal. The percentage of fines (<63^m) is greater at Swansea
Bay than at Nicholaston. This, along with the larger mean grain
size, suggests that a higher energy source prevails at Nicholaston.
Wind data supplied by the Meteorological Office, Bracknell, were
taken at Mumbles Head (Swansea Bay), an exposed head-land lying
between the two sites and thus broadly applicable to both of them.
They indicate that winds blowing from 22 Io-280° (the prevalent
direction) account for 34.4 p. 100 of all wind for the period 1969-
1979. The two localities are affected by such winds to different
degrees, the Nicholaston locality being afforded the least shelter by
headlands. This is reflected in the slightly larger grain size, lower
fines content and steeper beach slope at Nicholaston.
Burkovsky (1971) considered that the ciliates which tend to
dominate exposed beaches are protected by well developed penicular
and fibrillar skeletal structures. Hartwig and Parker (1977) believed
that those species with a short body and a more compressed or
rounded shape are more resistant to exposure. Similarly, the ciliates
of depositing shores (characterised by fine sediments) make up a
fauna which is equivalent to the microporal group of Fauré-Fremiet
(loc. sit.) in their morphology as typified by such species as Trachelo-
raphis prenanti f. oligocineata Raikov and Kovaljeva, 1968, Pseudo-

PSAMMOBIOTIC CI LI ATES 235
prorodon arenicola Kahl, 1933, Condylostoma remanei Spiegel, 1928,
C. fjeldi (Hartwig and Parker, 1977).
Hartwig (1973), when studying the ciliate fauna of the Island
of Sylt (North Sea), made a distinction between ecological groups
of ciliates based not only on the grain size of sediments but also on
beach position. On a typical medium wave beaten beach the shore
could be divided into the sand flat, which is almost fully saturated,
a region between the sand flat and beach slope at the landward
part of the beach, and the beach slope which is saturated only
immediately shorewards of a rising and falling tide. Each of these
regions has a typical fauna, a larger number of species being found
in the sand flat than in the beach slope. When comparing beaches
of different exposure, Hartwig observed that both highly exposed
and sheltered shores had fewer species than a shore of medium
exposure.
The two shores in this survey differ in exposure, Nicholaston
being more exposed than Swansea Bay. As a result of this exposure,
the beach slope is steeper at Nicholaston and so the water table is
at the surface only immediately landwards of a rising and falling
tide; at Swansea Bay, the beach slope is gentle and the water table
is always at the surface. The movement of the water table at
Nicholaston produces variable ecological gradients during a tide.
This difference in stability of gradients results in the markedly
different ecology of the two ciliate populations. At the Swansea
Bay locality, the total ciliate population is dependent on temperature,
reaching a maximum in the warmer months, whilst at Nicholaston
the numbers are independent of air temperature. This can be
explained by the lack of buffering of temperature variations due to
the absence of a water table. In considering the families and species
regarded as ecological groups at Nicholaston, none show a significant
relationship between numbers and temperature. At Swansea Bay,
several groups show a significant relationship with temperature :
Trachelocercidae, Colepidae, Coleps similis and Tracheloraphis ditis
and T. conformis. The Condylostomatidae and Euplotidae are inde­
pendent of temperature in as far as they occurred at irregular
intervals throughout the sampling period. A third category includes
those groups which occurred throughout the sampling period but are
not significantly related to temperature: Loxodidae, Geleidae, Pleurone-
matidae, Tracheloraphis teissieri, T. hamatus, Trachelonema oligo­
striata and Coleps pulcher; of these, the Loxodidae showed a signi­
ficant increase with time.
As part of the study, the organic carbon content was measured
(using the titration method of Gaudette et al., 1974) and, for an eight
month period, the numbers of motile diatoms and flagellates extracted
by Uhlig sea-water ice technique (Uhlig, 1968) were recorded. Nei­
ther of these groups of data significantly correlated with temperature
at either Swansea Bay or Nicholaston; however, flagellate numbers
did show a significant decrease over the time during which they
were sampled. Dale (1974) found a significant correlation between
bacterial numbers, as revealed by acradine orange staining, and the
amounts of organic carbon and nitrogen when grain size was the

236 J.M. WRIGHT
controlled parameter in a partial correlation analysis. Therefore,
the organic carbon content is a measure of the numbers of bacteria
present. Bacteria are a major constituent of the diet of many ciliates
(Fenchel 1968, 1969) and, if it is assumed that their division rate is
dependent on temperature, then the relative accuracy of the titration
method for the given range of organic carbon contents is called into
question.

Fig. 19
The interrelationships of various factors affecting the conditions suitable for

The groups of ciliates which depend on temperature are presu­
mably utilising food organisms which also depend on temperature
and are therefore seasonal, whilst the second group of ciliates are
able to utilise intermittent food supplies. The third group, of which
the Loxodidae show a significant temporal variation and the Geleidae
a pronounced temporal trend, tend to produce maxima in spring
and autumn : Pleuronematidae, Coleps pulcher, Tracheloraphis hama-
tus (with a third peak in February 1980) and T. teissieri with a peak

PSAMMOBIOTIC CI LIATES 237
in spring and a second peak in December, Trachelonema oligastriata
has a single peak in June. Burkovsky (1979) studied a seasonal
succession of ciliates and found that during the warmer months,
larger omnivorous ciliates produce large populations although the
diversity is reduced. The first stages of the succession are charac­
terised by the frequent change in dominating species related to a
corresponding change in environmental conditions. The varying
dominance of the third category of ciliates observed at Swansea
Bay may well be following a succession; however, the sampling inter­
val is large and not suitable for the definition of any succession
at Swansea Bay.
At Swansea Bay, in addition to the relationship between numbers
and temperature for certain groups, it has been shown for most
groups that there is a significant temperature-related migration
towards the surface during the warmer months, whilst at Nicho-
laston there are no groups that show this migration. Similarly, at
Swansea Bay most groups show a significant migration into the top
2cm of sediment whilst at Nicholaston only Euplotes balteatus shows
this movement. The observed migrations at Swansea Bay are related
to corresponding changes in environmental factors as typified by the
R.P.D., which has been shown to move up or down (Fenchel 1971,
Ott and Machan 1971).
Hartwig, considering many of the factors upon which the abun­
dance of a ciliate population depends, produced a scheme based on
Burkovsky (1971) in which the effect of wave action and therefore
exposure is given prime importance. The energy input to a site, in
the form of wave action, affects grain size and therefore pore
volume, organic matter content, bacterial numbers and chemical or
physico-chemical parameters such as redox potential and pH. Many
of these factors are inter-related, depending on temperatures and
ultimately the presence or absence of th water table (Fig. 19 after
Burkovsky 1971 and Hartwig 1973).
Summary
The number and distribution psammobiotic ciliates occurring on two sandy
shores in South Wales is described. The variation in numbers and species shows
considerable differences between the two shores. The Swansea Bay populations
show a temperature related increase whilst those ciliates occurring at Nicholaston
seem to be independent of temperature. This difference in population dynamics
is ascribed to differences in exposure to wave action.
