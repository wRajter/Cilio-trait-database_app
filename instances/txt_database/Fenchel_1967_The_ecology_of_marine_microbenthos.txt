ABSTRACT
ta
An investigation of the quantitative importance of protozoans - especially ciliates - has been ]lehcneF
undertaken in Scandinavianwaters. Ciliates were found in numbersfrom 106to 4X 107individ-
uals per m' representing 0.03-2.3 grammes wet weight per m'. Highest numbers were found in
fine sandand in localities with a rich growthofsulphur-bacteria. In these sedimentsciliates are
moT
10to 100times morenumerousthanthetotal numberofmetazoans, and theirbiomassis ofthe
same order or sometimes larger than the biomass ofthe micro-metazoans (nematodes, turbel-
rM[
larians, gastrotrichs etc.). In coarser sand ciliates are fewer, and micro-metazoans play a larger
quantitativerole. This distribution isexplained by thesmallsize and othermorphological adap- ,]yrarbiL
tations makingciliates able to inhabit thesmallinterstitia offine sand, and also their ability to
endurereducing and anaerobicconditions. In the detritus layers which coverclayeyand muddy
sedimentsciliatesarefewin numberand playasmallrolecomparedwithmetazoangroups,such
as nematodes, which maysometimes be as numerous as ciliates. ytisrevinU
A comparison with the enumeration of the benthic metazoans in Niva Bay carried out by
Muus(J967) showsthat93%ofall animalsin thebay areciliateswhich,however, onlycomprise
0.4%ofthe total animal biomass.
Large dinofiagellates were found in numbers of105to 1.5X 107 per m'. Euglenoids are less negahnepoC[
numerous, normallyfewer than 5X 105perm'.Nakedamoebaeseem also to playa small quan-
titativerole; more than 105 per m' wererarely found.
Ciliates show a maximum population size in summer, but this maximum may be obscured
by other factors in more exposed localities. Large populations of active animals are found
throughout theyear. yb
Theimportanceofciliatesin communityrespiration is discussed. Itis concludedthat in loca-
dedaolnwoD
lities withfine sand and in sulphuretathe ciliates accountfor a largerpartthan thernicro-rneta-
zoa, and that theciliates contributesignificantlyto theenergeticsofthese communities.
INTRODUCTION
During the last decades there has been a wide interest in the structure and func-
tion of the ecosystem constituted by the sea-bottom and its flora and fauna,
especially in the role played by smaller organisms, since their ecology was, until
recently, little known. Thus several ecological studies on small invertebrates have

122 TOM FENCHEL
appeared(e.g. Jansson, 1966;Muus, 1967;Pennak, 1951; Renaud-Debyser, 1963;
Renaud-Debyser & Salvat, 1963; Smidt, 1951; Wieser, 1960, and Wieser &
Kanwisher, 1961).
Also, the ecology ofmarine bacteria and protophytes has been studied inten-
sively during the later years (see Oppenheimer, 1963and Wood, 1965, 1967 for
references). 2102
The ecology ofprotozoans, however, has drawn less attention, mainly due to
technical difficulties in quantitative enumeration. Benthic protozoans cannot be rebmeceD
counted in their substratum without a tremendous amount ofwork, nor can they
be extracted from the sediment by narcotization or/and washing. Furthermore
they must either be studied alive or treated with a time-consuming cytological
22
technique in order to be identified. On the other hand protozoans do not lend
95:00
themselves to bacteriological technique. The role played by protozoans in the
ecosystem is therefore little known. Due to lack ofevidence they are often con-
ta
sidered to be unimportant. Thus Pennak (1951) considers protozoans to be "sel- ]lehcneF
dom abundant" in marine beaches, and Dogiel (1965p. 591)writes: "The Flagel-
lata and Ciliata occupy a modest place in the benthonic marine fauna".
Thepresentpaperisthe first in a series describingvariousaspectsofthe ecology moT
ofmarine micro-benthos with special emphasis on ciliates. Following papers will
rM[
describefood-chains, physicalandchemicalproperties ofsediments,verticalzona-
tion offactors and fauna in the sediments, relations to other organisms, growth ,]yrarbiL
in cultures, and ecological succession. The purpose ofthe present paper is to re-
port on the quantitative importance of ciliates as compared with other animal
groups in various marine sediments, while the qualitative distribution will be ytisrevinU
described in later papers.
As mentioned above, little quantitative work on marine benthic protozoans
has appeared. Fjeld (1955) studied the ciliates of sand quantitatively. However,
negahnepoC[
with the extraction method employed (washing the sand with sea-water) the ma-
jorityofthe hapticforms werelost during the processandhisresults are probably
one to two orders ofmagnitude too low. Nordid he relatehis findings to a stand-
ard area ofthe sea-bottom. Since the ciliate fauna changes quantitatively as well
as qualitatively at various depths in the sedimenthis results can not be evaluated. yb
Borror (1963)in his study on the benthic ciliatefauna in Florida also made some dedaolnwoD
quantitative studies. Although his method of enumeration (direct counting) is
reliable he did not refer his findings to astandard area ofthe sea-bottom. Mare
(1942) tried to enumerate protozoans of marine sediments by bacteriological me-
thods, viz. a dilution culture method. This gives a quitefalse picture of the fauna,
since only forms feeding on heterotrophic bacteria will thrive in such cultures. In
fact, ofciliates she found only a fewbacteria-feedingspecies. Atleastone ofthese
species (Uronema marinum) forms cysts, so the method does not tell anything
about the number ofactive animals at any specified moment.

used in the present paper.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
The present paper is based on 76 quantitative samples which, besides representa-
tives from other taxonomic groups, contained in all 83,370 ciliates. The sampling
localities will all be described in detail in following papers; here they will only be yb
listed together with short characterizing notes. dedaolnwoD
1. Asko, an island in the Baltic Sea south of Stockholm. Samples were taken
in a sheltered bay near the laboratory on poorly sorted, sulphide containing sand
and on detritus covered clay. One sample was taken on an exposed sandy beach
on the other side ofthe island. All samples are from August 1966and June-July
1967.
Il. 0resund (Fig. 1).- A. Several localities were sampled in a line perpendicu-
lar to the coast in the northern part ofthe Sound in January-April 1966and in
May-June 1967at depths from 0.5 to 25 metres. The sediments are fine homoge-
nous sandwith more or less detritus, clean homogenous medium sand, and clayey

124 TOM FENCHEL
sand from the deepest localities. - B. A few samples were taken at Julebtek in a
sheltered locality behind sandbars at 0.2 m depth in May 1967. The sediment is
fine sand. - C. 28 samples were taken at the beach outside the Marine Biological
Laboratory in the period October 1966-September 1967at 0.2-0.5 metres depth.
The sediment is fine homogenous sand. - D. A few samples were taken in gravel
at 0.3 m depth off the Kronborg Castle in June 1966.- E. Several stations were 2102
sampled regularly in Niva Bay in all seasons ofthe year. Niva Bay is a shallow
sheltered bay with homogenous medium sand and with growth of Ruppia and rebmeceD
Zostera. Stations dominated by colourless or purple sulphur bacteria were also
sampled.
Ill. The Isefjord, a fjord in the northern part ofZealand. Samples were taken
22
in a sheltered cove close to the Isefjord Laboratory. The sediment is fine sand
95:00
rich in detritus and with patchy growth of Zostera. The samples were taken at
depths from 0.2 to 1metre in April 1967. ta
All samples were taken with a pvc-tube with an internal diameter of2.1 cm. ]lehcneF
The tube was pressed about 20 cm into the sediment,closedinthe topwithacork,
withdrawn and corked in the lower end. In the laboratory the upper cork was
replaced by a cork with a bore fitted with a glass-tube and a piece of rubber- moT
tubing closed by a clamp. The sampling tube was placed in a rack and the lower
rM[
cork was removed. By opening and closing the clamp it is possible to make the
sediment core slide downwards stepwise, and each time 1,2,or 3 cm ofthe core ,]yrarbiL
appears below the samplingtube it iscut free and allowed to fall into a 3cm high
cylindrical container with the same internal diameter as the sampling tube (Fig.
2). This method was found superior to the conventional method ofsplitting sedi- ytisrevinU
ment cores, viz. by pushing the sediment upwards with a piston. By the method
employedthe originalzonation,andespeciallythe sedimentsurface, ismuch better
preserved and the core segments are easily secured in separate containers. The
negahnepoC[
supernatant water is also preserved over the uppermost sediment segment.
Ifthe sediment was very coarse or expected to contain only a few animals the
whole core segment of3.5, 7.0, or 11.5ern"(depending on the length ofthe seg-
ment) was extracted for microfauna. In most cases, however, a subsample was
taken in each core segment with a pvc-tube with an internal diameter of 1.31cm yb
(area: 1.0ems) so that 1,2 or 3cm"ofsediment was extracted. dedaolnwoD
By the method employed it is possible at the same time to study the vertical
zonation and to secure all animals below a known area ofthe sea-bottom.
In all capillary sediments, even those with strongly reducing properties, a sig-
nificant number of ciliates may be expected 6-8 cm below the surface, and in
cleaner sand it is necessary to extract sand down to 20 cm below the surface in
order to obtain all the animals. In some localities a significant number ofciliates
were found in the deepest part ofthe cores, but the cores were not taken longer
than 21cm, sincefriction alongthe sides ofthe core would then disturb the zona-
tion. (All stations described in the present paper are permanently water covered.

Samples from more than 5 metres depth were taken with a Moore and Neill
corer (see Barnes, 1959 for description) fitted with the above mentioned pvc
sampling tubes. Clean sand tends to be washed out from below when the corer is
negahnepoC[
on its way up in spite ofthe top-valve ofthe corer. Dr. E.Kanneworfftherefore
kindly suggested the following modification to me which solves the problem satis-
factorily (Fig. 3).A small hole is made0.5 cm from the lower end ofthesampling
tube. A nylon cord is drawn through the hole. In one end it is attached to a hard
rubber ball (diameter2.3 cm) and in the other end to a strongrubber band which yb
in its turn can be attached to the corer. A small hook made ofpvc is welded to dedaolnwoD
the sampling tube 15-20cm from the lower end.
When a sampleis to be taken the sampling tube is placed in the corerand the
rubber band is attached to the corer. The rubber band should be stretched in this
"released" position and the rubber ball thus closes the opening ofthe sampling
tube firmly. The rubber ball is then fastened by the hook by further stretching of
the rubber band and the corerisloweredtowards the bottom. When the sampling
tube has descended sufficiently into the sediment the rubber ball is released from
the hook by the sediment surface, and when the corer ascends the sediment core
is supported from below by the.ball. In spite ofthe simple and costless construe-

The "sea-water ice" method ofUh1igwas used for extracting the microfauna ,]yrarbiL
(a detailed description and discussion ofthe method may be found in Uhlig, 1964,
1966). Since the volumes of sediment extracted (in most cases 2 or 3 ern") were
smaller than those recommended by Uhlig (25 cm"), extraction filters with a dia- ytisrevinU
meter of only 2.1 cm were used. As a standard the filters (nylon gauze) had a
mesh size of 120f.Lbutforextractionsofcoarsesandameshsizeof265 f.Lwas used.
The sea-water used for receiving the extracted animals and for making the
negahnepoC[
sea-water ice was aged sea-water of approximately the salinity of the sampling
locality (6%0 in the Baltic, 20%0 elsewhere). As a standard, each subsample was
extracted for 1hour with 2 refillings ofice and 2 or 3 changes ofthe containers
receiving the extracted animals (evaporating dishes). Extracted animals are nearly
always in good condition, they may be used for initiating cultures, and will often yb
keep alive for days in the dishes into which they were extracted. dedaolnwoD
Uhlig(1964)found an extractionefficiencyofabout90%for ciliates andabout
75%for turbellarians in his preliminary experiments. During the present investi-
gation the efficiencywas checked on several occasions. Theciliates used originated
either from cultures or were extracted from a natural sand sample prior to the
experiment.20-100 individuals ofa singlespecieswere placed in 2ern"clean moist
sand which was then extracted and the numbers ofanimals that appeared after 1,
10, 30, and 60 minutes were counted. The following species were used: Frontonia
marina, Lionotus lamella, Metopus contortus, Sonderia schizostoma, and Trachelo-
raphis kahli. A typical result of an experiment is shown in Fig. 4. In all cases the

128 TOM FENCHEL
extraction was nearly completed after 30 minutes. The efficiency was found to
vary between 70 and 90%. It is probable that the efficiency is somewhat higher
when extracting natural samples since manipulation ofthe animals in the experi-
ments may lead to some mortality. However, it must be stressedthatall enumera-
tions give minimum figures, and that the efficiency of the extracting procedure
cannot be stated more accurately than above. Flagellates seem to be extracted 2102
with the same efficiencyand speed as ciliates. Nematodes, as mentioned by Uhlig,
seem to be less well extracted. My observations on sand samples after extraction rebmeceD
sometimes indicated an efficiency as low as 60%. The extraction efficiency of
amoebae, tardigrades, rotatorians, gastrotrichs, harpacticoids, ostracods, and an-
nelids is unknown and may wellbe lower than that ofciliates.
22
Different species are extracted at different rates. For instance, in a sample of
95:00
fine sand Remanella spp., Lacrymaria spp., Mesodinium pupula and dinoflagel-
lates will be nearly completely extracted within a few minutes, while Geleia spp., ta
Kentrophorus spp., Aspidisca spp. and most metazoans appear later. ]lehcneF
Muchdetritusin the samples make countingofthe animalsmoredifficult since
some detritus willpass through the filter.
Non-capillary sediments (clay and clayey sand) cannot be extracted, but in moT
these sediments practically all ciliates are confined to the uppermost few mm of
rM[
loose sediment. The few samples of this sort which were treated quantitatively,
were counted directly. The uppermost layers were pipetted from the sampling ,]yrarbiL
tubes into petridishes with sea-water and the microfauna was counted under the
dissecting microscope.
Mats offilamentous cyanophyceans and sulphur bacteria prolong extraction ytisrevinU
and if they are strongly developed it pays to tear them apart with needles before
extraction.
The animals were counted under the dissecting microscope by picking them
negahnepoC[
up one by one with a pipette from the evaporating dishes. Since a sample cor-
responding to 1ern"surface may contain up to 4000 and often 1-2000ciliates, in
addition to other organisms, it is necessary to identify the most common (about
100)species under the dissecting microscope. The species ofmost ciliate genera
can be identified in this way. For the small species ofgenera as Cyclidium, Cris- yb
tigera, Plagiocampa, etc. and most oxytrichids this is not possible, however, and dedaolnwoD
the species ofsome problematicgenera such as Tracheloraphis were not identified
to species.
Ittakes 4-8 hours to extract, count and identify the contents ofa core sample
corresponding to 1 cm" with about 2000 ciliates, making allowance for a few
identifications of difficult species under the microscope. All samples were ex-
tracted and counted on the day ofcollection.
The biomass of ciliates was estimated volumetrically. Single ciliates were
placed in a "Rote-Compressor" (for description seeHeunert & Uhlig, 1966)and
the length of the unpressed animal was measured. It was then pressed until it

had plane-parallel sides. Its thickness was measured by reading the scale on the
fine adjustment of the microscope. Its outline was traced with a camera lucida
and the surface area calculated by weighing. The specific gravity of ciliates was
put to 1. A varied number of specimens comprising 14species were measured in
this way (Fig. 5). For these species the average weight was used when calculating
the biomass. The weight of other species was estimated from Fig. 5by the length 2102
and by resemblance in shape to measured species.
The weights of gastrotrichs, nematodes, turbellarians, harpacticoids, ostra- rebmeceD
cods, and archiannelids were taken from Renaud-Debyser & Salvat (1963) while
the weights of rotifers, tardigrades and oligochaetes were estimated from their
dimensions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
ta
The findings from 9 samples from 9 different types of sediments and depths are ]lehcneF
shown on Figs. 6 (individuals per m") and 7 (grammes per m"). In all localities
between 106 and 4 X 107 ciliates perm- are found. Largest numbers (>107 perm-)
are found in finesand (mediangrain size: 125-250fL) and inlocalitieswith strongly moT
reducingsediments and a rich growth ofsulphur bacteria (sulphureta, represented
rM[
by the Niva localities). In all these localities the number ofciliates far exceeds the
number of metazoans. In coarser sand and gravel ciliates are less numerous and ,]yrarbiL
micro-metazoans become more important. Here the latter are also represented by
a numberofgroups not or rarely present in finesand (annelids, ostracods). In the
detritus layer on the surface of muddy and clayey sediments ciliates play a com- ytisrevinU
paratively small role and may even be exceeded in numbers by nematodes and
turbellarians.
In fine sand and in sulphureta the ciliates normally constitute 0.5 to 1.5g per
negahnepoC[
m"(more than 2gper m"issometimesfound) which isabout the same as the total
weight ofrnicro-metazoa, while in coarser sediments and in detritus the biomass
of ciliates is far exceeded by that of micro-metazoans. (In and on non-capillary
sediments the concept "microfauna" is not well defined, thus acarines, chirono-
mids and oligochaetes - included in Figs. 6 and 7 - are normally not considered yb
as microfauna. In sand the microfauna is clearly defined as the interstitial fauna dedaolnwoD
in contrast to larger forms which burrow in the substrate.)
The water line ofstrongly exposed beaches contains a poor fauna, as demon-
strated by the Asko sample.
Other protozoan groups, e.g. large dinoflagellates (genera such as Amphidi-
nium, Gymnodinium, and Peridiniumj, euglenoids and naked amoebae were also
enumerated in some of the samples. The large dinoflagellates occur in numbers
between 105 and 1.5X 107 per m". Euglenoids are rare but most commonly found
in sulphureta (105-106 perm"). Amoebae seem to be ofminor importance(usually
fewer than 105 per m") but this may be due to inefficiency ofextraction.

QUANTITATIVE IMPORTANCE OF CILIATES 131
The above described composition of the fauna in various sediments may be
explained by two factors, a mechanical and a chemical one.
As previously discussed by many authors (see Swedmark, 1964for references)
the sizeofinterstitiaisalimitingfactor for the mesopsammon. Within some ciliate
groups forms with a very small body size (c. 20 fL) have developed. Large forms
with specialized body shapes, are also found, e.g. thread-like (Trachelocerca spp.) 2102
or thin, leaf-like, only a few microns thick(Remanella spp. andKentrophorusspp.).
These "microporal" forms (Faure-Fremiet, 1950; Dragesco, 1960) are specially rebmeceD
adapted to move in the small interstitia offine sand. Only few metazoans have
achieved such extreme morphological adaptations to life in small interstitia, and
consequently the ciliates dominate this environment. In coarser sand with larger
22
interstitia a much higher number of metazoan "life-forms" are able to exist and
95:00
consequently metazoans play a much larger role in these sediments.
The relation between median grain size and the size of the interstitia, how-
ta
ever, is not a simple one, since the grade of sorting also plays a significant role. ]lehcneF
Nevertheless, in homogenous sands it may be taken as a rule that ciliatesplay the
largest role in the sediments with the finest grain sizes.
In clayey sediments the interstitia are clogged and no interstitial fauna occurs. moT
A fauna dominated by nematodesis found in these sediments, and on the detritus
rM[
covered surface a rich and varied microfauna may be found in which the ciliates,
however, play a comparatively small role. ,]yrarbiL
As shown by Fenchel &Jansson (1966) many ciliates can livedeep in the sedi-
ment under anaerobic and reducing conditions where few or no metazoans are
found. This is in accordance with the fact that ciliates play a dominating role in ytisrevinU
sulphureta where most metazoans can live only on the sediment surface. In con-
trast to fine sand, coarse sand is often oxidized far down and this also explains
the larger role played by metazoansin these sediments. In clayey and muddy sedi-
negahnepoC[
ments reducing conditions are common, but being unable to burrow, ciliates are
here only found on the thin oxidized surface layer.
In his memoir on Danish lagoons and estuaries Muus (1967) reports on the
numbers and biomass of all benthic metazoans weighing morethan 10-6g,found
in the summer in the Niva Bay. In Fig. 8his findings are combined with my enu- yb
rnerations ofanimals weighing less than 10-6g.Theweight category 10-6to 10-5g dedaolnwoD
comprises nematodes, turbellarians, harpacticoids and ostracods which were also
enumerated by me. These findings (average of samples taken in the period April-
July: 8.3 X 105 individuals = 3.7 g per m") are in good accordance with those of
Muus who used direct sorting of sediment samples. The weight category 10-9 to
10-6 gcomprises ciliates, rotifers, chaetonotid gastrotrichs, and tardigrads, but
the ciliates constitute more than 90%by weight and about 99%by numbers of
this category.
Thus it can be seen that the ciliates constitute 93%of the total number of
benthic animals living in the bay and about 0.4%ofthe biomass.

The numbers ofanimals - includingmicrofauna- is usuallyconsidered to de-
crease with increasing depth. Disregarding samples from the shallow and very
fertile Niva Bay such a relation was not found (compare the findings from sandy
bottom at 0.5, 10and 15metres depth from 0resund on Figs. 6-7). However, no
samples were taken from below 25 m, and the type ofsediment varies at various
depths in 0resund. Possibly, sampling at greater depths in an area with a more

bellarians, rotifers, and harpacticoids) show an obvious summer peak, as pre-
viously demonstrated by several authors (Muus, 1967; Smidt, 1951), A maximum
in the ciliate population is also seen in the sheltered Niva locality. In the more
exposed Helsinger locality this is obscured mainly by accumulations ofdriftweed yb
(early fall 1966and late winter 1967)followed by an increasein the ciliatepopula- dedaolnwoD
tion. The biomass curve does notshow similar large peaks since the ciliate succes-
sion on decaying driftweed initiates with a dominance ofsmall species.
These year cycles will be described later in full detail and are mentioned here
only to demonstrate that ciliates are usually most numerous in summer, though
this may be changed by other factors, and that there is a significant number of
ciliates throughoutthe year (in the periodJanuary-March 1967the watertempera-
ture of0resund was constantly below 2°C).
It is ofinterest to know the relative importance ofthe various animal groups
in the total respiration ofthe community. Estimates have been made on marine

benthos by Wieser & Kanwisher (1961)and Carey (1967). These papers conclude
that bacteria and microfauna are offar larger importance than the macrofauna.
yb
Wieser and Kanwisher who studied the ecology of a muddy Spartina-flat found
that 10-15%ofthe bottom respiration was due to metazoans, 25-33%to nema- dedaolnwoD
todes while the rest was considered to be due to protozoans and bacteria. Unfor-
tunately, technical difficulties still prevent obtaining values ofrespiration for the
large number ofprotozoan species, ofwhich the great majority have not yet been
kept in culture. Thus, the relative importance ofbacterial and protozoan respira-
tion in the bottom cannotyet be estimated.
Comparisons ofthe metabolic importance ofciliatesand larger metazoansare
problematic. Considerations based on biomass will underestimate and considera-
tion based on numbers will overestimate the importance of the ciliates due to the
relation between metabolism and body size. In sediments where biomasses ofcili-

ates and micro-metazoans are about the same (fine sand and sulphureta) the cili-
ates must account for a large part ofcommunity respiration; this becomes clear
when Wieser & Kanwisher's results and the small size ofciliates are kept in mind.
