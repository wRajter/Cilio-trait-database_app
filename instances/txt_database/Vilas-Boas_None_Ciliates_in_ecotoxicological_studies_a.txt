a minireview. Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia, 2020, vol. 32, e202.
Abstract: The present study has conducted a minireview of ecotoxicological studies using ciliated
microeucaryotes, presenting a breif history, describing the current scenario and pointing out their
methodological approaches gaps. We highlight in a clear and objective way the ecological importance
of ciliates for ecosystems, their usefulness and the inherent characteristics that classify them as a good
model organism. Finally, we discuss some modern tools that can be added to studies with ciliates in
the near future.
Keywords: Ciliophora, ecotoxicology; model organism.
Resumo: O presente estudo realizou uma pequena revisão de estudos ecotoxicológicos utilizando
microeucariotos ciliados, apresentando um histórico, descrevendo o cenário atual e apontando suas
lacunas nas abordagens metodológicas. Destacamos de forma clara e objetiva a importância ecológica
dos ciliados para os ecossistemas, sua utilidade e as características inerentes que os classificam como
bons organismos modelo. Finalmente, discutimos algumas ferramentas modernas que podem ser
adicionadas aos estudos com os ciliados em um futuro próximo.
