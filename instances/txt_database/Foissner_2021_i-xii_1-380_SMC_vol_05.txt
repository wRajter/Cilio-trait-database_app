Preface and acknowledgements
Ciliates are single-celled eukaryotes inhabiting all main habitats, that is, freshwater, the sea, and
the soil. Especially terrestrial habitats have been studied by Wilhelm Foissner, one of the most
productive ciliatologists of the past decades. Unfortunately, Wilhelm died from the consequences
of an aneurysm in March 2020. He discovered a huge amount of ciliate species from almost all
over the world and described them in many hundreds of works, including 13 monographs. His last
major project dealt with the ciliates from Australian soils. A significant number of these species is
published in the present book.
Soil samples for the present project were collected mainly by W. Foissner, but several other
persons were also concerned with sampling; many thanks to all of them. Robert Schörghofer
smoothed the micrographs with the computer and Michael Gruber made morphometries and line
drawings of several species.
Wilhelm Foissner and his co-workers involved in this project got financial support by the
Austrian Science Fund FWF [Project 26325, “Biodiversity of soil ciliates (Protista, Ciliophora)
from Australia”]. I wish to thank Wilhelm and Ilse Foissner who privately financed my work on this
project.

The present monograph, “Terrestrial ciliates (Protista, Ciliophora) from Australia and some other
parts of the world”, is Wilhelm (“Willi”) Foissner’s last work on ciliates. Willi died on March 20,
2020 (Berger 2020).
In 2013 Wilhelm Foissner applied for his last project at the Austrian Science Fund with the
working title “Biodiversity of Soil Ciliates (Protista, Ciliophora) from Australia”. The main goal of
this study was to describe all new ciliates which he has discovered in many soil samples collected
by him and others in Australia (Fig. 1a–h). As in his other monographs on ciliates from certain
biogeographic regions (see below), the present work also contains some new taxa which have their
type locality not in Australia, but in other countries, namely Austria, Botswana (Fig. 1i–k), Brazil,
Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Madeira Island, Mexico, Namibia, Sweden, The Netherlands, and
the USA.
Willi’s first works dealing with Australian soil ciliates were published in 1988 (Blatterer & Foissner
1988, Foissner 1988). Other papers and books treating Australian ciliates and other protists are
Blatterer & Foissner (1992), Foissner (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995, 1997a, 1997b, 1998, 2003a, 2003b,
2016a, 2016b), Foissner & O’Donoghue (1990), Foissner et al. (1988a, 1988b, 1999, 2001, 2002,
2008), Gabilondo & Foissner (2009), Kumar & Foissner (2016, 2017), Lüftenegger & Foissner
(1991), Oertel et al. (2008), Omar & Foissner (2011), Vďačný & Foissner (2012, 2017a, 2017b,
2019), Vďačný et al. (2012), and Weisse et al. (2007, 2008). For many abstracts dealing with protists
from Australia, see website www.wfoissner.at.
Wilhelm Foissner already published monographs dealing with ciliates from other areas of the
world, namely on the soil ciliates from Namibia (Foissner et al. 2002) and from Venezuela and
Galápagos (Foissner 2016). In addition, his scientific legacy harbors material from many other
biogeographic regions.
Since 2017 I assisted Willi with word processing, that is, I transferred his hand-written texts
into word-files. The main work in the present book is Chapter 4 where the taxa are described and

documented in about 1100 figures. In addition, he has prepared two further parts, namely one
on sampling, collection of material for preparations, etc. (Chapter 2) which is based mainly on
Foissner et al. (2002), and an update of his well-known description of the methods to study ciliates,
mainly based on Foissner (1991, 2014) (Chapter 3). Unfortunately, W. Foissner could not finish
the systematic part of his last project, which thus contains only a part of the Australian species
discovered by him. In addition, he did not start with the general section which should contain, as
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 1–7 / 2

Chapter 1: Introduction
in his other monographs (Foissner et al. 2002, Foissner 2016), inter alia, detailed descriptions of
the samples collected by him and others during several journeys to this continent, a detailed list of
the species recorded from Australia, and some comments on the biogeography of ciliates. Since I
was not actively involved in this project, I cannot finish this study as it was originally planned. Few
weeks before his sudden death he informed a colleague that it needs still about three further years
of intensive work to finish the monograph. Therefore, I came to the conclusion — in agreement
with Ilse Foissner and Erna Aescht — to publish the available parts of the manuscript as they
are. Originally it was planned to publish the work in the book series Denisia (Linz), as he did it
with some of his previous monographs (Foissner 2016, Foissner et al. 2002, Vďačný & Foissner
2012). However, since a restructuring of the Museum in Linz is currently underway, we decided to
publish W. Foissner’s last monograph not in Denisia, but in my Series Monographiae Ciliophorae.
Since Willi passed away in March 2020, a review process is not possible and thus the manuscript is
published as it was when he died. I made only very minor changes (e.g., correction of spelling errors,
rough adaptation of editorial style on previous numbers, e.g., Berger 2018). In some cases, I had to
make notes which are clearly indicated in footnotes.
The raw manuscript of Chapter 4 contained the descriptions of the gymnostomatean taxa
Lamelliophrya nov. gen. and L. australiensis nov. spec. As type species Willi has fixed L. bras i­
liensis nov. spec.1 He proposed the following diagnosis for the genus: “Lingulotrichidae with
tongue-shaped, two-dimensional cortical scales (lepidosomes) without anchoring structure
adhering lepidosomes to pellicle. Dorsal brush heteromorphic and with more than three rows.”
The diagnosis for L. australiensis is: “Size in vivo about 110 × 20 µm, up to 40% contractile;
cylindroid. Macronucleus oblong, polymorph. Two types of extrusomes attached to oral bulge:
type I spiniform, slightly curved, about 10 µm long; type II oblong, slightly curved, about 2 µm
long. Lepidosome layer obliquely striated, 2–3 µm thick. On average 20 ciliary rows, five anteriorly
modified to a dorsal brush with minute bristles (± 2 µm). Oral bulge oblique, about 6 µm wide
and 1 µm high. Moves like a contractile Euglena.” Unfortunately, the type species L. brasiliensis
was not yet described and I could not find the raw data (ring binder with live observations, slides,
micrographs) within reasonable time. Thus, I do not include Lamelliophrya and L. australiensis in
the present monograph (Chapter 4). It will be published later when I have an overview about the
content of the many hundreds of ring binders with unpublished material left behind by W. Foissner.
Wilhelm Foissner was a highly productive microscopist. Most of his scientific life Willi used a
Reichert Polyvar (since about mid-1980s). He made many thousands of permanent preparations.
Most of them are still in his huge private collection, but many are already deposited in museums,
mainly in the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (Aescht 2008, 2013, 2018a, b). For almost each
permanent preparation exists a sheet of paper where he has noticed the co-ordinates of many
individuals. Since in future Foissner’s collection of slides will be studied with other devices I provide
an instruction how to use his co-ordinates on other microscopes (Fig. 2). On the type and voucher
slides which are already in depositories the relevant specimens have been marked by black ink
circles on the cover-glass (for examples, see Aescht 2008, p. 133–137 and Fig. 1a–e to Fig. 39a–f in
Chapter 5 of present book).

28.0/6.8 Neutral co-ordinates (zero point: 0.0/0.0)
1 The names Lamelliophrya, L. australiensis, and L. brasiliensis are disclaimed for nomenclatural purposes (ICZN
1999, Article 8.3), that is, these three taxa are not made available in the present work.

ordinates (black) with the neutral zero point (0.0/0.0) at the lower left corner of the slide. For details, see text.
Calculation of neutral co-ordinates of specimen X
Direction 1
Subtract 1.2 (= 1.2 mm) from Foissner’s value (29.2 in example)
Example: 29.2–1.2 = 28.0
Direction 2
Subtract 108.2 (= 108.2 mm) from Foissner’s value (115.0 in example)
Example: 115.0–108.2 = 6.8
Find specimen X with your microscope
1. Go to the zero point of the slide (lower left corner)
2. Move 28.0 mm in direction 1
3. Move 6.8 mm in direction 2
4. Now you should see specimen X with your microscope!
Recommendation
Marking of relevant specimens on a microscopic slide deposited in a museum is usually done by a
black ink circle (e.g., Aescht 2008, p. 133ff; Foissner et al. 2002, p. 35; Chapter 5 of present book).
This method is basically usable, but has some disadvantages, for example, (i) specimens may be
masked by the usually rather broad and clumsy ink circle; (ii) the ink circles may disappear when the
slide is checked with oil immersion or anisole; (iii) the slide cannot be cleaned easily without wiping
off the ink; (iv) making the circles is rather laborious.
To avoid all these problems, I highly recommend mentioning the co-ordinates of the relevant
specimens (e.g., holotype, drawn paratype, drawn voucher, neotype) in the publication. To be
independent of the microscope used, the co-ordinates should refer to the so-called “neutral zero
point” (NZP) of the slide, that is, the lower left corner of the slide (Fig. 2). In addition, at least the
slide containing the holotype specimen should be shown as a micrograph in the original description.
For micrographs of the slides containing the species described in Chapter 4, see Chapter 5.

2.1 Sampling and sample processing
The material collected usually includes mineral topsoil (0–5 cm, rarely up to 10 cm depth) with fine
plant roots, the humic layer, and the deciduous and/or grass litter from the soil surface. In soil with
few organic materials and very sandy habitats, litter was sieved off the sand with an ordinary kitchen
sieve (1 mm mesh-size), so that the final sample consisted of about 80% litter and 20% sand and
gravel. Usually, 10 small subsamples were collected with a small shovel from an area of about 100 m2
and mixed to a composite sample. Bark samples were usually taken from one to three trees. The bark
was collected with a knife, selecting for regions grown with mosses or lichens and/or containing
some soil.
Generally, a “good” sample consists of 50% litter, humus and roots and 50% mineral soil. The
litter and humus are very important because they release many nutrients when the sample is rewetted,
stimulating growth of bacteria, fungi, flagellates, and amoeba, that is, the main food of ciliates. The
nutrient increase obviously decouples microbiostasis, as explained in Foissner (1987).
All samples were air-dried for at least one month and then sealed in plastic bags. Such samples
can be stored for years without significant loss of species, provided they are from arid or temperate
environments (Foissner 1997). This is emphasized by the Australian investigations: there is no
correlation between storage time and species number; indeed, the richest samples are those stored
for over four years (see also Foissner et al. 2002).
All collections were analyzed with the “non-flooded Petri dish method”, as described by Foissner
(1987, 1992). The technique is not perfect but likely the best available for biodiversity assessment
of soil ciliates at large. The protocol is simple (see Fig. 262 in Foissner et al. 2002):
1 Note by H. Berger: This chapter is basically from Foissner et al. (2002) with several modifications. Wilhelm Foissner
made some corrections which I included. However, the manuscript was not finished, especially as concerns hints to spe-
cific samples from Australia. I had to delete these hints because I could not reconstruct what he exactly meant. I made
the reference section for this chapter.

1 Put the material in a Petri dish and spread it over the bottom of the dish in at least a 1 cm, better
2–3 cm thick layer. As concerns the Australian samples, sufficient material was available to fill a
2 cm high Petri dish 13 cm across or, rarely, a 3 cm high dish 18 cm in diameter. Basically, a large
Petri dish (18 cm) is preferable because it provides more material for preparations.
2 Slightly over-saturate but do not flood the sample with distilled water. Water should be added
to the sample until 5–20 ml will drain off when the Petri dish is tilted (45°) and the soil gently
pressed with a finger. Complete saturation takes up to 12 h, so check cultures after this time.
Never flood the sample, that is, do not make an Aufguss (“infusion”) because then only a few
common species will develop. Further, the material should have been dry for at least one month.
3 Cover Petri dish and pinch a clip between bottom and lid to enable gas exchange. Generally, care
must be taken that the samples do not putrefy. This happens rather easily with saline material, soil
containing animal excrements or, in “ordinary” samples, if the litter is very easily decomposable.
In this case, change the water in the sample and do not cover it for some days so that plenty of
air is available; further, slightly under-saturate sample with water. Heavily saline soil (≥20‰)
should be “washed”, if no ciliates develop. Saturate the sample with water, as described above.
After 2–3 d, remove the percolate and saturate again with water. Repeat two to four times, until
ciliates begin to develop.
4 A distinct succession occurs in the rewetted samples. Thus, they must be inspected on days 2, 6/7,
13/14, 21/22, and 30. Later inspections usually add only few species, likely because microbiostasis
(ciliatostasis; see Foissner 1987) increases and metazoan (rotifers, nematodes) and protozoan
(mainly heliozoans!) predators often became abundant. For inspection, the Petri dish is tilted
some seconds and a rather large drop (~0.3 ml) of the drained water (“soil percolate”) taken
with a Pasteur pipette and inspected for species; several such drops must be investigated from
different sites of the Petri dish, until the last drop adds but few species.
5 Rainforest samples: When rainforest litter and soil samples are air-dried for the non-flooded
Petri dish method, then one must consider that the resting cysts of rainforest protists are much
weaker than those from moderate or hot and dry regions. There is a rapid loss of species in samples
older than nine month (Foissner 1997, 2011), and new data from Venezuela (Foissner 2016) and
Australia show great loss within a month.
In Mérida (Venezuela) and Borneo (Foissner 2011, 2016), I had the opportunity to look at
fresh samples. They were full of ciliates, similar as in a mesotrophic river! The negative influence
of prolonged drying becomes obvious also in the samples from the Australian and Tasmanian
rainforests. Those which were investigated within a year provided much more species than those
investigated 4–6 years after collection.
These observations provide two recommendations: soil and litter ciliates from everwet rainforests
should be investigated on site without any culture method or within about two months after air
drying when the non-flooded Petri dish method is used. Up to one year drying is possible for
rainforests whose litter and upper soil layer become dry during the dry season.
6 Other culture methods: The non-flooded Petri dish cultures, as described above, provided about
90% of the material contained in the monograph. The rest is from a variety of ordinary “limnetic”
cultures. First, clone cultures were made in the usual way by transferring individual specimens
into various media, preferable Eau de Volvic (French table water), either pure or mixed with
soil extract in a ratio of 10:1 and enriched with a crushed and two uncrushed wheat grains to
stimulate growth of indigenous food organisms, viz., bacteria and small flagellates; occasionally,
selected food items were added, for instance, filamentous cyanobacteria for several nassulids.
Second, 2 ml of the percolate (together with all organisms) were mixed with 8 ml Eau de Volvic
and enriched with wheat grains, as described above. Of course, such cultures contain a variety of
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 9–20 / 10

Chapter 2: Sampling, collection of material for preparations, identification, description, species concept, types
ciliates, and sometimes interesting species develop for a while. Third, a Petri dish was filled with
10–20 ml culture medium plus some wheat grains. Then some grams of soil were added as an
inoculate to a small site of the Petri dish, taking care not to distribute it throughout the medium.
Such cultures were sometimes helpful for strongly saline material (>20‰), which is set up with
artificial sea water. Fourth, if the sample is very saline (>20‰), it may occur that no ciliates
develop. Such samples can be “washed” every third day with fresh table water, which decreases
the salt concentration. Frequently, ciliates appear after the third or fourth wash! See also item 3
above.
7 Problems: Data of the kind presented are highly dependent on the (non-flooded Petri dish)
method used to reactivate ciliates from the air-dried samples, that is, to stimulate them to leave
the resting cysts and to reproduce to detectable numbers. I highlight this problem, although it
was discussed in detail by Foissner (1987, 1997, 1999), because it heavily influences data analysis
and interpretation. Specifically, it causes undersampling of species which are rare and/or have
special demands (Foissner 1997), and explains the phenomenon that 30–40% undescribed
species are found in large sample collections, such as the Australian and Namibian material while
the individual samples contain only one or two new species (Foissner 1999).
Usually, soil ciliates are not active but encysted, producing a “hidden biodiversity”. The resting
cysts can survive for years (Foissner 1987), provided they are from specimens living in dry or
temperate climates, where soils desiccate from time to time; in humid environments, such as rain
forests, the resting cysts are not adapted to survive longer dryness, and thus the non-flooded Petri
dish method does not work (Foissner 1997). But even with “optimal” samples, the non-flooded
Petri dish method is selective, that is, cannot provide an environment suitable for all kind of ciliates.
This becomes evident when the same site is investigated several times over a year (Foissner 1999),
or a single sample is manipulated to encourage encysted and more rare forms of ciliates to emerge
(Esteban et al. 2000). Figure 1 shows that a single sample from a certain site collects only about one
Fig. 1. Cumulative number of species obtained with the non-flooded Petri dish method (Foissner 1987) in 17 monthly
and bimonthly samplings from a 100 m2 area of beech forest soil in Austria (from Foissner et al. 2002). The curve
flattens distinctly at sample number 13, indicating that further effort hardly will increase species number significantly.
However, direct investigation of fresh samples after rainfalls provided 30 further species. Accordingly, the total number
approaches 160 species, which is far from the total number (about 1500) of soil ciliates known. Thus, I do not agree
with the hypothesis of Finlay & Esteban (1998) that “all species of freshwater protozoa could eventually be discovered
in one small pond”.

Foissner Wilhelm
third of the species present, that is, the number found in 17 replicates distributed over two years
(further examples, see Foissner 1987). Likely, this applies also to the Australian samples.
Fortunately, there is evidence that the situation changes if many samples are analyzed from a not
too large area, that is, if the Australian samples are considered as some sort of replication.
Even if a certain ciliate excysts, we can hardly recognize it among the mass of soil particles. To be
seen, it must reproduce to a detectable number. And even if this occurs, there remains the problem
of recognizing it as a distinct taxon among hundreds of individuals from other species, many of
which look alike. Only when experience, live observation, and silver impregnation are combined,
reliable species lists will emerge.
In sum, there is convincing evidence that the non-flooded Petri dish method is selective, that
is, reactivates only a rather small, undefined fraction of the resting cysts present in a sample, and
undescribed species or species with specialized demands are undersampled. Thus, the real number of
species, described and undescribed, is considerably higher in the samples investigated. Unfortunately,
a better method for broad analysis of soil ciliates is not known. On the other hand, about 800 new
ciliate species were discovered by Foissner (1998, 2016) and colleagues with this simple method,
suggesting, inter alia, that a considerable amount of the hidden biodiversity can be revealed by
investigating large numbers of samples.
2.2 Collection of material for preparations
If a “difficult” species is noted, which happens in more than 70% of the samples, material for
preparations must be collected. To obtain many specimens, the Petri dish is tilted (45°) several times
for a minute or so and the percolating soil water collected with a Pasteur pipette from several sites
of the dish. If only little water (<10 ml) drains from the sample and/or the species of interest is
very rare, it should be sprinkled with 10–15 ml distilled water. This will cause an osmotic shock,
detaching or rinsing many specimens from the soil particles and capillaries within about 10 min.
Then, the procedure described above is repeated, that is, the Petri dish is tilted several times and
the percolating soil water added to the first collection. Finally, the soil sample is again saturated
with clean table water (e.g. Eau de Volvic) and stored for the next investigation. Certainly, these
procedures strongly change the milieu, and thus a rather different ciliate community may develop,
possibly containing further “difficult” species. If so, the whole procedure is repeated, and so on.
Much care must be taken to keep the percolate clean of large (>2 m) soil particles, which
would disturb the investigation of the preparation, while particles smaller than 2 m hardly
μ
disturb, if not too numerous. To achieve clean material, note the following advices:
μ
1 Usually, the percolating soil water which contains the organisms will be clean because the soil
particles soon become stabilized by microbial activities, mainly by fungal hyphae and bacterial
mucilage. Thus, extreme care must be taken not to destroy the soil structure developed in the
non-flooded Petri dish culture. Accordingly, the Petri dish must be handled gently and, if
necessary, distilled water sprinkled softly on the surface. To increase percolation, mild finger
pressure on the soil may be applied. Depending on the material sampled, the percolate has a
light brown to orange colour (from lignins, humus colloids, etc.), which does not disturb the
preparations (but see below).
2 The percolate is now gently shaken and large soil particles allowed to settle for about one
minute. Then, the supernatant, which is now ready for preparations, is collected with a Pasteur
pipette. Be careful not to lose bottom-dwellers. Occasionally, it may be helpful to sieve the
percolate through a plankton net with 50–100 m mesh-size or to concentrate it by mild
centrifugation (max. 2000 min-1 for a few seconds), especially for preparations with expensive
μ
chemicals (osmium tetroxide in Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate impregnation).

2.3 Identification of species
Provided sufficient experience, many ciliate species can be identified from life at low magnification
(×100–200). Of course, details must be checked at high magnification (×1000, oil immersion),
preferably with interference contrast optics. All “difficult”, new, or supposedly new species must be
treated with the silver impregnation techniques described in Chapter 3. Accordingly, my species
lists are a mixture of taxa identified in vivo and/or silver preparations. However, I emphasize
that all species were seen in silver slides, at least from one site. Thus, seen on a whole, all species
were observed in vivo and in silver preparations. Identification literature is highly scattered and
cited in the reference section (see Chapter 4) and Foissner (1998). Still indispensable are Kahl’s
monographs (Kahl 1930, 1931, 1932, 1935) and, for colpodids and hypotrichs, the recent
reviews by Foissner (1993) and Berger (1999, 2006, 2008, 2011); for euplotids, peritrichs and
suctorians, the reviews by Curds (1986) and Warren (1986) are very useful. Keys for limnetic
(Berger & Foissner 2003) or marine (Carey 1992) ciliates are almost useless because only about
25% of the species occur both in terrestrial, limnetic, or marine habitats.
2.4 Description of species, morphometry, and illustrations
The monograph contains mainly species observed both in vivo and in silver preparations, as minimal
requirements for a solid description, morphometry, and illustrations; light and scanning electron
micrographs were prepared whenever possible.
Species descriptions were performed in telegramese style, as is good practice among experienced
taxonomists, a fact often overlooked by protozoologists, who prefer prose style, which makes the
description unnecessarily long and circumstantial. Furthermore, each of the new or improved taxa
is headed by a brief “diagnosis”, containing only those features which, in my opinion, separate the
species from its nearest relatives, as already emphasized by Linne. A “diagnosis” is not an abbreviated
description, as is often assumed, and is thus usually very short.
Usually, my descriptions have a certain order, namely that used in identification: body size
and shape; nuclear apparatus; contractile vacuole; cortex and extrusomes; cytoplasm and food;
movement; somatic and oral ciliary pattern; occurrence and ecology; comparison with related
species. Within the individual items, location of the structure comes first, followed by its shape and
size.
Morphometry is indispensable for a good description of a ciliate and was performed on 10–20
randomly selected, well-impregnated specimens. The data is tabulated and thus repeated in the
descriptions only if needed for clarity. Most observations are from material as obtained with the non-
flooded Petri dish method, that is, not from clone cultures. Thus, I cannot exclude that similar but
different species were sometimes confused, although this is unlikely because I excluded specimens
which deviated in at least one prominent feature. Certainly, this can generate some bias in the data
if used too uncritically. However, I usually excluded only such specimens which had, e.g., a different
nuclear structure (likely often postconjugates), a distinctly deviating ciliary pattern (likely often
injured, regenerating or malformed specimens), an unusually small size (likely often degenerating,
just excysted or divided specimens), or a combination of deviating features. The inclusion of such
individuals, which might sometimes belong to another species, would have artificially increased
variability.
Illustrations of live specimens were based on free-hand sketches and/or micrographs and
video prints. Generally, my main in vivo illustration of a certain species represents a summary
of the observations, that is, shows a “representative” specimen composed on observations of live
and prepared cells. Illustrations of prepared cells were made with a drawing device and show the
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 9–20 / 13

Foissner Wilhelm
specimens as they are, smoothed only by removing obvious artifacts. Great care was taken to make
these illustrations accurate and beautiful; usually, a “typical” specimen is shown with values near the
arithmetic means.
Micrographs are an important supplement to any description, but often difficult to obtain because
the cells are moving and/or out of the focal plane. Thus, much patience and skill is needed to produce
meaningful micrographs. Even more helpful is scanning electron microscopy because it provides a
three-dimensional view of the organism. Unfortunately, good scanning electron micrographs are
difficult to obtain from soil ciliates for the reasons explained above. All these problems made it
impossible to provide micrographs of all species described. If not stated otherwise, all figures are
orientated with the anterior end of the organism directed to the top of the page.
2.5 Estimation of in vivo size
In vivo measurements of body size were performed at a magnification of ×100–250, while details
such as extrusomes and food vacuoles were measured at ×1000, where a measuring unit of the ocular
micrometer is 1 µm. Likewise, all measurements of prepared cells were made at a magnification of
×1000. Measuring body size in vivo provided only rough values because the cells were moving. I
used these data mainly as a kind of control for shrinkage due to the preparation procedures.
Usually, I measure body length and width of a few contrasting specimens in vivo and without
using a coverslip. As the organisms are moving, this provides only approximate values which are
improved by the morphometric analysis of the preparations. The following percentages compensate
preparation shrinkage; they were obtained from comparative analyses, such as shown in Maryna spp.
(Foissner 2016): 15% (10–20%) for Foissner’s protargol method, 20–30% when pure ethanol was
used as a fixative; 5% for Chatton-Lwoff` silver nitrate preparations; and 0% for wet preparations
fixed with osmium vapours or a minute drop of osmium acid (2%). Shrinkage is highly variable in
SEM preparations, ranging from near zero to 100%1 in very fragile structures, e.g., the lepidosomes
of trachelophyllids (Foissner 2016). The same applies for protargol methods and silver carbonate
preparations that do not fix specimens on a slide before bleaching and impregnation.
2.6 Species/subspecies concept
The species concept, of course, influences the number of species found and/or recognized as
undescribed (Luckow 1995, McDade 1995, Turner 1999). I usually apply the phylogenetic species
concept as defined by Nixon & Wheeler (1990): “A species is the smallest aggregation of populations
(sexual) or lineages (asexual) diagnosable by a unique combination of character states in comparable
individuals (semaphoronts)”. Basically, this is a morphospecies concept which is, according to
Ehrendorfer (1984) and Finlay et al. (1996), as valid as any, and probably more pragmatic than any
other; see Ehrendorfer (1984), Luckow (1995), McDade (1995), and Turner (1999) for detailed
discussion.
I do not consider myself as splitter, that is, I classify species as undescribed (new) only if
populations can be separated from their nearest relatives by at least one distinct (nonmorphometric)
morphological feature, such as presence/absence of caudal cirri or rod-shaped vs. fusiform extrusomes,
or if quantitative differences, such as body size and/or number of ciliary rows, are really conspicuous
(>100%). Furthermore, I must have seen at least 10 individuals and studied the species in vivo
and silver preparations, to provide reliable morphometrics, illustrations, and types. Certainly, the
present monograph contains some exceptions because it is unlikely that the Australian soil ciliate
fauna will be described or reinvestigated in the coming 30 years. However, it is my belief that careful

Chapter 2: Sampling, collection of material for preparations, identification, description, species concept, types
live observation is usually indispensable for a good description. Thus, I rarely describe species seen
only in silver slides.
Mayr (1963) defines a subspecies as “an aggregate of local populations of a species inhabiting
a geographic subdivision of the range of the species, and differing taxonomically from other
populations of the species”. This concept, especially geographic isolation has been widely adopted,
although there is still a lot of discussion (Böhme 1978, O’Neill 1982, Rolán-Alvarez & Rolán 1995).
Unfortunately, biogeography of protozoa is still in its infancy, and thus Mayr’s concept hardly can
be applied. Nonetheless, subspecies are useful also in protists, when used restrictively and as a simple
taxonomic tool.
In our monographs, we distinguish subspecies according to distinct morphometrical differences
in important features (e.g., number of ciliary rows) and/or qualitative (morphological) characters
whose taxonomic value is still doubtful or not known. It is the last mentioned feature which makes
the subspecies concept so useful: the name can be easily withdrawn if later research proves the features
used to be unreliable, and the discoverer does not lose priority to “armchair” taxonomists if the
subspecies later gets species rank (ICZN 1999). Furthermore, subspecies “collect” the infraspecific
variation, that is, data which tend to be lost (Zusi 1982), and enhance identification of species
because of the broader concept; thus subspecies are especially useful for people and disciplines not
specifically trained in taxonomy. In spite of the obvious advantages, protozoologists rarely used the
subspecies/subgenus concept, although Kahl (1932) established some subgenera and varieties in
ciliates and one third of the testate amoebae taxa are “variations” or “forms”, most of which must be
considered as subspecies according to the ICZN (Foissner & Korganova 2000). Further, subspecies
are common in extant and fossil foraminifera (Boltovskoy 1954) and fossil tintinnids (Belokrys
1997). There is now a tendency to use them also in extant ciliates (Song & Wei 1998).
A further main factor influencing the number of species recognized as undescribed is the
treatment of literature data. Many of the old protozoan species descriptions lack type material and
are poor compared with the present standard because the pioneers did not have the advantages of
modern methods. Clearly, there is a tendency to disrespect the efforts of our predecessors and to
establish new taxa with new methods. My approach is to respect and reinterpret previous work
and to neotypify species, provided that at least one main feature matches (see also chapter on
neotypification). Representative examples for our way of making honest alpha-taxonomy can be
found in the section on nassulids in the monograph on Namibian soil ciliates (Foissner et al. 2002).
2.7 Type material and neotypification
2.7.1 Type material
Most descriptions in this monograph are based on live observation and silver impregnation, which
usually yield permanent slides. For the new and the neotypified species, at least one holotype
(neotype) and one paratype slide have been selected. One or more slides have been selected for the
species redescribed. All slides have been deposited in the Oberösterreichische Landesmuseum in
Linz (LI), Austria. The slides usually contain several specimens, with about 10 relevant cells marked
by a black ink circle on the coverslip.1
If appropriate, the type slides are accompanied by an equally-sized sheet of paper, which states
the species and the kind of types contained (H – holotype specimen, N – neo(holo)type specimen,
1 Note by H. Berger: Foissner planned a table showing the accession numbers of the type and voucher slides, like Table
1 in Foissner et al. (2002). This table was not prepared by W. Foissner. For details on type material and voucher slides,
see paragraphs “Type material” or “Material” at individual descriptions in Chapter 4. For further details on slides of taxa
described in Chapter 4, for example, accession numbers, see Chapter 5.

P – paratype specimen, V – voucher). The specimens which served as a basis for the illustrations are
marked by the letter “D”, for instance, PD = paratype used for illustration. The holotype specimen
(H), of course, has been drawn. Note that some slides contain types of several species, which are
distinguished by different colours or letters. Furthermore, several species occurring in Australia and
described in this monograph have been found and studied previously in soil samples from other
regions of the world. Thus, the type locality of some of the new taxa is not in Australia, that is,
not contained in the site descriptions given above.1 Brief site descriptions for these species and
populations are provided in the respective occurrence and ecology sections. The samples were
processed like those from Australia.
2.7.2 Neotypification
I broadly apply neotypification in this monograph.2 As this poses a major problem (see below), I shall
discuss it in detail. Furthermore, I published a paper in the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature
discussing neotypification in protists (Foissner 2002).
Methods for preparing soft-bodied ciliates with a quality that provides meaningful types to be
deposited have only been available for the past five decades. At present, most “modern” ciliate types
are deposited in two centres: the Smithsonian Institution in the USA (Corliss 1972, Cole 1994)
and the Museum of Natural History of Upper Austria in Linz (Aescht 1994, 2008).3 However, more
than 90% of all described ciliates lack type material at all, or the material hardly shows the species-
specific features, or is difficult to obtain because deposited in private or University collections (see
Foissner & Pfister 1997 for an example).
Certainly, the lack of types is one of the most difficult problems in ciliate and protozoan
alpha-taxonomy in general. There are innumerable examples of poorly described species, doubtful
identifications, and problematic redescriptions. Although my group usually recognizes a thorough
redescription as “authoritative” (e.g. Foissner 1993), others do not.
Berger (1999), for instance, assigned Onychodromopsis flexilis Stokes, 1887, carefully redescribed
and neotypified by Petz & Foissner (1996), to Allotricha, a genus and species never illustrated
or carefully described. Obviously, no consensus can be reached, and ciliate identification and
nomenclature remain a matter of choice.
Clearly, many of the existing problems could be solved by types. The present practice of using
illustrations as types cannot solve the problem because these cannot be reinvestigated. Thus,
neotypification is the only way to overcome these and related problems and to bring stability in ciliate
taxonomy and identification. This was emphasized already in 1972 by Corliss, who established some
neotypes for “difficult” ciliates in the sixties. Likewise, Medioli & Scott (1985) established neotypes
for some testate amoebae. Generally, however, neotypification is exceedingly rare for protists. It was
only recently that my group commenced using this valuable instrument on a large scale (Foissner 1997,
1999a, Foissner & Brozek 1996, Foissner & Dragesco 1996, Foissner & Kreutz 1996, Petz & Foissner
1996); several specialists followed (Agatha & Riedel-Lorje 1998, Petz et al. 1995, Song et al. 2001).
Neotypification is strictly regulated by article 75 of the Code (ICZN 1999). Because our neotypes
deviate in an important aspect from the Code rulings, and protists have several peculiarities (Corliss
1 Note by H. Berger: The detailed “site description” was not yet done by W. Foissner. I could not reconstruct these data
within reasonable time. Thus, this section is not included in the present book. However, at each described species (see
Chapter 4) a detailed site description has been provided by the author.
2 Note by H. Berger: I checked the descriptions and found that none of the species redescribed in the present work is
neotypified. Despite I did not change the text.
3 Note by H. Berger: Many type slides of ciliates are also deposited in other repositories; for details, see Warren et al.
(2017, p. 42).
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 9–20 / 16

Chapter 2: Sampling, collection of material for preparations, identification, description, species concept, types
1993), they need a detailed comment. We establish neotypes only if at least one of the following
items applies:
1 No useable type material is available, and the identification appears reasonable.
2 The original description is so incomplete and/or based on so few specimens that any identification
becomes arbitrary. Alternatively, such descriptions could be considered as species indeterminata.
However, this would greatly increase the number of scientific names because many original
descriptions of ciliates are very incomplete, at least from our present point of view. Thus, we
prefer to identify our taxa with previous ones, even if these are poorly described, and to redefine
them by detailed redescriptions; of course, identification requires matching of at least one main
feature.
3 The species has one or more proposed subjective synonyms, that is, a questionable identity discussed
in the literature. This is, in the absence of type material, a “classic” case for neotypification.
4 If there are several similar species whose identity is threatened by the species to be neotypified.
5 If there are competing redescriptions.
6 If the new preparations (“neotype slides”) are of a quality allowing the specific features to be
clearly recognizable.
Conditions as described above basically pose no problems for neotypification according to the
Code. However, our neotypes usually do not comply with article 75.3.6 (ICZN 1999), that is, are
not from or near the type locality. Thus, they might be considered as invalid. However, we defend
our approach for the following reasons:
1 Most ciliates and protists are cosmopolitan, at least at morphospecies level (Finlay et al. 1996,
Foissner 1999).
2 The existing chaos can be mastered only by types available to everyone. Certainly, the chaos
produced by a few probably misidentified neotypes is much smaller than the existing one.
3 Considering the situation in alpha-taxonomy of ciliates, where only few regularly publishing
taxonomists are left worldwide, we cannot wait for neotype material from or near to the type
locality. If so, types will never be established! Furthermore, the chances of rediscovering such
minute organisms at a certain locality are minimal because they may be in a dormant (cystic)
stage most of their lives and cultivation is often not successful.
To sum up, I suggest that neotypes of protists, especially ciliates, should be freed from the type
locality regulation of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999; article
75.3.6.), provided that neotypification is based on a thorough redescription of the organism and
useable neotype material has been deposited in an acknowledged repository.1

Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa1, 2

3.1 Introduction
This is an update of the review by Foissner (1991). Since then, I have improved some methods
considerably. The following methods are described in detail: live observation, supravital staining
with methyl green-pyronin, dry silver nitrate impregnation, wet silver nitrate impregnation, silver
carbonate impregnation, protargol impregnation (three procedures), scanning electron microscopy,
deciliation, and labelling of permanent preparations, deposition of type material. Familiarity with
these methods (or modifications) is a prerequisite for successful taxonomic work. No staining method
is equally appropriate to all kinds of ciliates. A table is provided which indicates those procedures
which work best for certain groups of ciliates (Table 1). A second table relates to the structures
revealed by the procedures (Table 2). Good descriptions usually demand at least live observation,
silver nitrate and protargol or silver carbonate impregnation. Some instructions are provided for
distinguishing mono- and dikinetids as well as ciliated and non-ciliated basal bodies in silvered
ciliates. Furthermore, I added a section on ‘Deposition and Labeling of Preparations’. All methods
work not only with ciliates but also with many other heterotrophic and autotrophic flagellated and
amoeboid protists. The brilliancy of silver preparations has tempted some taxonomists to neglect
live observation. However, many important species characteristics cannot be seen or are changed
in silvered specimens. I thus consider all species descriptions based exclusively on silver slides as
incomplete.
The micrographs of various freshwater, marine and soil ciliates published by my colleagues and
myself during the past 45 years, most based on the few methods described here and by Foissner
(1991), have been widely accepted as being of a high standard. All methods are modifications of
techniques which initially did not work well in our laboratory, either because they were incompletely
described or too complicated. Here, I provide detailed step-by-step protocols for the methods used
in our laboratory. For other techniques, the reader is referred to the literature cited and to the

b ‘Cortical granules’ include various extrusive (especially mucocyts or mucocyst-like extrusomes) and non-extrusive

Foissner Wilhelm
on hard experimental work or, rarely, on good luck. As an example for both, I mention the use of
albumized slides (luck) and of a chemical developer (many experiments) for the dry silver nitrate
method of Klein (1926, 1943). The results of these modifications were so convincing that I could
publish them in Mikrokosmos, a journal for amateur microscopists, when I was just fifteen. Since
then, I tried to improve the methods almost continuously, the most recent success being a simple
technique for deciliation so that the often complex cortical and ciliary structures can be observed
with outstanding clarity (Fig. 6).
In addition, photographic documentation has profited greatly from the digital revolution. The
images can be nicely improved, and the problem of low focal depth can be overcome by stacking
(Fig. 3).
3.2 Structures revealed by the methods described and interpretation of silver impregnations
There is no single method which can reveal all details necessary for a good description of a ciliate.
Likewise, no staining method is equally appropriate to all kinds of ciliates. Good descriptions usually
demand, as is evident from Tables 1 and 2, at least live observation, silver nitrate and protargol or
silver carbonate impregnation. The brilliancy of silver preparations has unfortunately tempted some
taxonomists to neglect live observation. However, many important species characteristics cannot
be seen or are changed in silvered specimens such that descriptions based exclusively on silver slides
are incomplete and of doubtful value for α-taxonomists and ecologists, especially as the latter are
usually not trained to correlate the silvered structures with the live appearance of the cell. Whenever
it is possible, important and/or unusual details (e.g. species characters) should be documented not
only by accurate drawings but also by photographs.
Several species (e.g. in the genera Pseudoprorodon and Cyrtolophosis) persistently withstand our
methods, their infraciliature and/or silverline pattern impregnates poorly or not at all. Further
improvements of existing methods or new techniques should therefore be developed. Stimulating
ideas can be found in the papers of J. Gelei (1934, 1935), G. Gelei (1939) and Horváth (1938).
The methods described here work not only with ciliates but also with many heterotrophic and
autotrophic flagellated and amoeboid protists.
Usually, silver impregnation is undertaken to reveal the infraciliature (= ciliary pattern) and
the silverline pattern (= lines revealed by silver nitrate, connecting basal bodies and other cortical
organelles such as extrusomes and the cytopyge). Extrusomes, various structures associated with
the basal bodies of the cilia (e.g. parasomal sacs, microtubular ribbons) and several cortical fibrillar
networks (e.g. the infraciliary lattice) are sometimes also impregnated. This may render interpretation
of silver impregnations difficult. It is beyond the scope of this treatise to discuss this problem in
detail; in fact, interpretation is different for each method (and even for slight variations of each
method) and almost for each higher systematic category. Thus, I must refer the reader to some key
references (Foissner 1977, 1981, G. Gelei 1939, J. Gelei 1934, Hiller 1991, Hiller & Bardele 1988,
Klein 1943, Peck 1974, Tellez et al. 1982, Zagon 1970). However, the differentiation of mono- and
dikinetids must be mentioned because this is of basic importance for successful taxonomic work.
Cilia and their basal bodies may be arranged singly (monokinetids) or in pairs (dikinetids); the
basal bodies may be ciliated or non-ciliated (e.g. Foissner & Foissner 1988). All silver methods
described here reveal at least the basal bodies (cilia are usually not impregnated with silver nitrate
methods), but not each black or brown granule is a basal body of a cilium! Depending on the
procedure used, other structures which have a similar size as the basal bodies are also impregnated
(e.g. parasomal sacs, extrusomes). Thus, the arrangement and the state of the basal bodies cannot be
unequivocally ascertained with silver methods, and transmission electron microscopy is necessary
[scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is insufficient as it often does not reveal non-ciliated basal
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 21–53 / 24

Chapter 3: Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa
bodies]. The following procedure provides a rather reliable differentiation of mono- and dikinetids
and of ciliated and non-ciliated basal bodies. (i) Study cells carefully in vivo, preferably with
interference contrast. With some experience it is easy to see whether or not cilia are paired. (ii) Over-
impregnate cells with protargol and/or silver carbonate. In over-impregnated cells cilia are usually
clearly recognizable. (iii) Non-ciliated basal bodies and/or parasomal sacs are often slightly smaller
than ciliated basal bodies. (iv) Study the electron microscopic literature related to the species or
group of species under investigation and try to correlate the stained structures with ultrastructural
features.
3.3 Methods
3.3.1 Observing living ciliates
Many physical and chemical methods have been described for retarding the movement of ciliates
in order to observe structural details (for literature, see Foissner 1991). Chemical immobilization
(e.g. nickel sulfate) or physical slowing down by increasing the viscosity of the medium (e.g. methyl
cellulose) are, in my experience, usually unsuitable. These procedures often change the shape of the
cell or cause premortal alterations of various cell structures. The following simple method is therefore
preferable: place approximately 0.5 ml of the raw sample on a slide and pick out/collect the desired
specimens with a micropipette (Fig. 1g–l) under a compound microscope equipped with a low
magnification (e.g. objective 4:1, eyepiece 10×). If specimens are large enough, they can be collected
from a Petri dish under a dissecting microscope. Working with micropipettes, the diameter of which
must be adjusted to the size of the specimens, requires some training. The collected specimens now
should be in a very small drop of fluid; reduce drop size when necessary with the micropipette.
Next, apply small dabs of petroleum jelly to each of the four corners of a coverslip or directly on the
slide; it is useful to apply the jelly by an ordinary syringe with a thick needle. Place the coverslip
on the minute droplet containing the ciliates. Press on the petroleum jelly corners with a mounted
needle until the ciliates become slightly squeezed between the slide and the coverslip (Fig. 1a–d).
As the pressure is increased, the ciliates gradually become less mobile and more transparent. Hence,
first the location of the main cell organelles (e.g. nuclear and oral apparatus, contractile vacuole) and
then the details (e.g. extrusomes, micronucleus) can easily be observed under low (×100–400) and
high (×1000, oil immersion objective) magnifications.
The shape of the cells is of course altered by this procedure. Therefore, specimens taken directly
from the sample with a large-bore pipette (opening ~1 mm) must first be investigated under low
magnification (×100–400). Some species are too fragile to withstand handling with the micropipette
and coverslip trapping without deterioration. Investigation with low magnification also requires
some experience but it guarantees that undamaged cells are recorded. Video-microscopy is very
useful at this point of investigation, especially for registering body shape and swimming behaviour.
A compound microscope equipped with differential interference contrast is best for observing
living ciliates. If not available, use bright-field or phase-contrast; the latter is only useful for very flat
species.
3.3.2 Staining and impregnation procedures
Although there are numerous methods for staining ciliates, most of the older procedures (e.g.
haematoxylin; see Kirby 1950 for an excellent compilation of protocols) have been outdated by
silver impregnation and scanning electron microscopy. Various silver impregnations are available,
but all need some experience and are usually individually modified. However, familiarity with the

four silver methods described below is an absolute prerequisite for studying ciliates. These are thus
described in detail in order to give even beginners a fair chance to obtain usable slides.
Apart from silver impregnation, various other staining techniques are useful for taxonomic work
with ciliates, especially the Feulgen nuclear reaction and supravital staining with methyl green-
pyronin in order to reveal the nuclear apparatus and the mucocysts, respectively.
Simple, viz., molecular formulae are given for the chemicals used, since usually only these are
found in the catalogues of the suppliers (e.g. Merck). In a laboratory manual it is thus convincing to
use this style too, instead of the more correct constitutional or structural formulae.
Five plates of selected micrographs should show examples of excellent preparations. There are
two ways to do this: either to use a few species and show them treated with all methods described
or to select many species to give the reader an impression of the diversity. I selected the second way
as it is possibly more convincing for beginners. However, two species (Colpidium colpoda, Fig. 2d, e,
6b, f and Paramecium caudatum, Fig. 2g, h, 3a) are shown prepared with three methods and several
others with two methods.
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 21–53 / 26

Chapter 3: Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa
3.3.2.1 Feulgen nuclear reaction
Descriptions of this method can be found in Lee et al. (1985) and Dragesco & Dragesco-Kernéis
(1986). The Feulgen reaction reveals the nuclear apparatus very selectively. I use it only occasionally
for α-taxonomic purposes because the nuclear apparatus usually impregnates well with protargol.
However, as protargol often impregnates various small cytoplasmic inclusions too, some caution
is necessary, especially with multimicronucleate species. If in doubt, use the Feulgen reaction or
another nuclear staining method, such as that described by Larsen (1975).
3.3.2.2 Supravital staining with methyl green-pyronin
This simple method is an excellent technique for revealing the mucocysts of many ciliates (however,
those of tetrahymenids and rather many haptorids usually do not stain). Mucocysts are stained
deeply and very selectively blue or red and can be observed in various stages of swelling because the
cells are not killed instantly. The nuclear apparatus is also stained. For examples see Fig. 2i in this
work and figures 8, 17 and 38 in Foissner (1991).
Procedure (after Foissner 1979)
1 Pick out the desired ciliates with a micropipette and place the very small drop of fluid in the
centre of a slide.
2 Add an equally sized drop of methyl green-pyronin and mix the two drops gently by swiveling
the slide or with a needle.
Remarks: If ciliates were already mounted under the coverslip, add a small drop of dye at one
edge of the coverslip and pass it through the preparation with a piece of filter paper placed at the
opposite end of the coverslip.
3 Place a coverslip with petroleum jelly corners on the preparation and squeeze specimens slightly.
Remarks: Observe immediately. Cells die in the stain within seconds or minutes. Mucocysts
stain very quickly and many can be observed at various stages of swelling. To reveal the nuclear
apparatus, cells should be fairly strongly squashed (= flattened). The preparation is temporary. After
5–10 min the cytoplasm often becomes heavily stained and obscures other details.
Reagents
a Solve 1 g methyl green-pyronin (CHROMA, Germany) in 100 ml distilled water and filter.
Remarks: This solution is very stable and can be used for years.
3.3.2.3 The ‘dry’ silver nitrate methods
Because of the numerous problems with the basic Klein (1926, 1958) technique, Foissner (1976)
and others (e.g. J. Gelei 1934, Ruzicka 1966) introduced some improvements. The dry methods
(‘dry’ because cells are air-dried and not chemically fixed before being treated with silver nitrate)
provide preliminary information on the somatic and oral infraciliature (= ciliary pattern) and are
often best for revealing the silverline pattern (= lines revealed by silver nitrate and connecting basal
bodies and other cortical organelles such as extrusomes and the cytopyge). Although the results
vary highly, the method is worthwhile because it is quick and often produces excellent preparations,
which can be well-documented since the cells are flattened during dehydration. Only cortical
structures are revealed. For examples see Fig. 2g in this work and figures 15, 19, 20, 23, 26, 35 and
36 in Foissner (1991).

Procedure (after Foissner 1976 and recent experience)
1 Take 5–10 clean slides and spread a very thin layer of albumin over the middle third of each with
a fingertip. Dry for at least 1 min.
Remarks: The egg-albumin (remove germinal disc! do not add glycerol) must have been kept
open in a wide-necked flask for at least 20 h; fresh albumin is often less satisfactory. It can be used
for 2–3 d if the flask is subsequently sealed; however, do not stir before use, but skim the albumin
from the surface with a fingertip. To facilitate spreading, breathe on the slide so that a film of

condensation is produced on which the albumin can glide. The albumin layer must be very thin and
uniform but should not cover the cells.
2 Place a drop of fluid containing the ciliates on the albumized slide, spread with a needle (do not
touch albumin layer!), and dry the preparation at room temperature.
Remarks: Even single specimens can be placed on the albumized slide with a micropipette. If
necessary, enrich ciliates by gentle centrifugation or by leaving the sample settle for a few hours,
which causes oxygen depletion and induces many ciliates to move to the water surface. The amount
and chemical composition of the fluid with which the ciliates are air-dried, as well as temperature
and air humidity, greatly influence the results. Therefore, 5–10 slides should usually be prepared
simultaneously to vary these parameters, e.g. by washing cells with different amounts of distilled
water or fresh culture medium. Washing cells with distilled water or spreading the drop to a very
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 21–53 / 31

thin film is especially recommended with saline fluids, e.g. seawater, sewage and soil. Temperature
and humidity are varied using an ordinary hairdryer.
3 Apply some drops of silver nitrate to the dried material for about 1 min.
Remarks: Do not touch albumin layer with the pipette. The reaction time does not influence the
results; a minute is adequate to impregnate and fix the cells on the slide.
4 Wash the slide for about 3 s with distilled water and redry.
Remarks: Wash gently! Apply water current from the top third of the tilted slide so that water
runs gently over the dried material. Leave slide tilted during drying.
5 Pre-develop the dried slide by exposing it for 5–60 s to a 40–60 W electric bulb at a distance of
3–10 cm.
Remarks: Time and distance influence intensity of impregnation (see also next step).
6 Apply a few drops of developer to the dried preparation for about 60 s.
Remarks: The pre-development (step 5), the composition of the developer, and the material itself
influence impregnation intensity and quality. The best ratio of these parameters must be evaluated
in pilot experiments. If the developer is well-adjusted, the albumin around the dried fluid turns
brown-black; if the developer is too strong, the albumin appears black (add some component A [see
Reagents] and/or reduce pre-developing time); if the developer is too weak, the albumin appears
brownish or yellowish (add some components B and/or C and/or increase pre-development time).
7 Pour developer off slide, rinse gently in tap water for 5–10 s, and immerse it in the fixative
(sodium thiosulfate) for 5 min.
8 Remove slide from fixative and rinse gently in tap water for 10 min changing the water three
times.
Remarks: The fixative must be thoroughly removed to avoid bleaching of the impregnation.
Preparations usually fade within a few weeks when the silver nitrate is reduced only by sunlight or
an UV-lamp. Do not use distilled water, otherwise cells swell and eventually detach from the slide!
9 Air-dry the slide again and mount in synthetic neutral medium (e.g. Eukitt, Euparal).
Remarks: Slides should be tilted during drying. Mounting medium should be of medium
viscosity. The preparation is stable, providing good fixation and careful elimination of the fixative.

3.3.2.4 The ‘wet’ silver nitrate methods
The first wet (‘wet’ because cells are chemically fixed before being treated with silver nitrate)
method was described by Chatton & Lwoff (1930, 1936). The technique became well-known after
Corliss (1953) published the version used in the Paris laboratory of Fauré-Fremiet. It works well
with many kinds of limnetic and marine ciliates, especially with hymenostomes (e.g. Tetrahymena,
Paramecium, Cyclidium), holophryids (e.g. Holophrya), most colpodids (e.g. Colpoda, Bresslauides)
and some hypotrichs (e.g. Euplotes). Less convincing results are usually obtained with peritrichs (e.g.
Vorticella), heterotrichs (e.g. Spirostomum, Metopus), oligotrichs (e.g. Halteria) and most hypotrichs
(e.g., Oxytricha, Urostyla). The wet methods provide valuable information on the somatic and oral
infraciliature as well as the silverlines, which are, however, often rather faintly impregnated. The
shape of the cells is usually well-preserved, which is of advantage to the investigation but makes
photographic documentation difficult. As with the dry methods, only cortical structures are
revealed. For examples see Fig. 2j, 3a–e in this work and figures 7, 10, 16, 28 and 29 in Foissner
(1991). Modifications have been described by for example Chatton (1940), Frankel & Heckmann
(1968), Lynn et al. (1981) and Roberts & Causton (1988), who investigated some variables in detail.
The method described in 1991 and likely all modifications have several problems: (i) the
gelatin, in which the specimens are embedded, is too weak, i.e. does not become sufficiently
solid, and the preparations are lost or full of clouds; (ii) the gelatin becomes cloudy and/or gets
sharp fissures above the individual cells, even if ‘good’ gelatin is used; (iii) the impregnation is too
faint, especially on the ‘back side’, that is the side oriented to the microscope slide; and (iv) the
impregnation bleaches more or less strongly within a few days or months.
Problem (i) can be solved by using good ‘Gelatin from Bovine Bone’ (e.g., Wako, Japan).
Problem (ii) occurs when the preparation becomes too warm, i.e. when the gelatin commences
melting. Thus, keep the preparation <10 °C throughout the procedure. Problem (iii) is partially
caused by the inability of UV-light to penetrate sufficiently the gelatin and the cells. Thus, silver
reduction should be done from above and below (see step 12) and chemical development should
follow UV-reduction. The fourth problem, I solved only recently (see steps 13–15). It makes the
protocol rather complex but is worth doing because stable preparations can be obtained. Several
slides should be prepared simultaneously from the same material. If only few specimens are
available, these must be handled with micropipettes during steps 1–7 (difficult task!); for ample
material a centrifuge may be used. Until dehydration (step 19), keep all solutions cold (<10 °C)
as warming causes clouds or even detaches the gelatin from the slide. The Da Fano solution is of
paramount significance because it determines the strength of the impregnation. If too much is

used, precipitations may develop; if too little is used, the impregnation may become too faint.
The method is not simple and requires experience. Since some steps must be done quickly, it is
necessary to be well-organized.
Procedure
1 If possible, concentrate ciliates by gentle centrifugation (the fixative is expensive) or collect
individual specimens and drop them into the fixative.
2 Put ciliates into Champy’s fluid and fix for 1–30 min.
Remarks: The ratio of material to fixative should be at least 1:1, better 1:2. The fixation time
apparently does not influence the results greatly. We usually fix for about 10 min. Fixation should
be carried out in a fume hood since osmic vapours are highly toxic.
3 Remove fixative by centrifugation or micropipette and post-fix in Da Fano’s fluid for at least 5
min. Continue this replacement until the solution is the colour of Da Fano’s fluid (2–3 times are
usually sufficient).
Remarks: Material can be stored in Da Fano’s fluid for years.
4 Place a clean, grease-free slide on a hotplate (35–60 °C).
Remarks: The slides must be grease-free (clean with alcohol and flame); even commercially pre-
cleaned slides should be cleaned with an alcohol-moist cloth.
5 Place a small piece (about 2–4 mm diameter) of gelatin in the centre of the warmed slide and
allow to melt.
Remarks: Gelatin should have been stored in the refrigerator for at least one week before use.
Fresh gelatin may cause cloudy silver deposits.
6 Quickly add an equal-sized or smaller drop of concentrated specimens to the molten gelatin and
remove slide from hotplate.
Remarks: Use the least amount of Da Fano’s fluid as possible. Mix organisms thoroughly into the
gelatin using a mounted needle.
7 Quickly spread the drop on the slide or remove excess fluid under the dissecting microscope with
a warmed micropipette until ciliates remain just nicely embedded in a thin gelatin layer.
Remarks: Steps 6 and 7 must be done quickly to avoid hardening and/or desiccation of the
gelatin; if the gelatin solidifies during the procedure return the slide to the hotplate for a few
seconds. Excess fluid can be removed only if ciliates are large or very numerous. For small (<100
µm) species, and in general, it is more convenient to spread the drop over the slide until the gelatin
layer has the appropriate thickness. If the drop does not spread well, the slide is not grease-free.
The gelatin layer must be thin to allow the silver nitrate and UV-light to pass through. Material
should be very concentrated; if too much Da Fano’s fluid has been used or remains, precipitations
develop or the gelatin detaches.
8 Immediately transfer the slide to a cold, moist chamber (e.g. a covered Petri dish with damp filter
paper covering the bottom). Leave for about 5 min in the refrigerator or on ice until the gelatin
has hardened.
Remarks: The gelatin must be hardened (check with tip of a mounted needle under dissecting
microscope if in doubt) but must not desiccate and/or freeze. Desiccated or frozen slides are of poor
quality.
9 Flush slide in cold distilled water for 3–10 s.
Remarks: This step is essential and determines the quality and intensity of the impregnation. If
the preparation is washed too long, the impregnation may become too faint; if it is insufficiently
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 21–53 / 34

Chapter 3: Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa
washed, coarse silver precipitations may cover the gelatin. It is recommended that at least four slides,
washed for 3, 5, 7 and 10 s, respectively, are prepared.
10 Immediately transfer slide to cold silver nitrate solution for 30–60 min.
Remarks: Keep silver nitrate solution cold, as warming melts and detaches the gelatin from the
slides. 30 min impregnation suffices for large ciliates (e.g. Paramecium). Immersion of more than 60
min intensifies impregnation only slightly and may cause darkening of cytoplasmic inclusions. The
gelatin layer becomes slightly milky in the silver nitrate solution. A distinct milky coat indicates that
too much Da Fano’s fluid has been used and/or remained (step 7).
11 Flush slides with cold distilled water for 1 min.
12 Immediately submerge slides into ~2 cm depth cold distilled water. Irradiate slides for 30 min
each from above and below to obtain fully impregnated cells, using UV sources (<254 nm)
placed 5–15 cm above and below the slides until the gelatin turns golden brown.
Remarks: Tilt dish gently back and forth and change water after 2–3 min of irradiation to
avoid silver precipitations. Take care that water remains cold (<10 °C).
13 After UV-irradiation, place slides in cold ordinary protargol developer diluted 1:1 with distilled
water for 15 min.
14 Wash slides in cold distilled water for 3 min.
15 Immerse slides for 5 min in the cold silver fixer (sodium thiosulfate) used for protargol
impregnation.
16 Wash slides five times in cold distilled water for about 10 h; keep the preparation cool in the
refrigerator.
Remarks: Washing out all chemicals is of paramount significance for stabilizing the preparation.
17 Transfer slides to chilled 30% and then 70% alcohol (ethanol) for 10 min each.
18 Complete dehydration by two transfers each at least 10 min long through 100% alcohol (ethanol)
at room temperature.
Remarks: As the gelatin hardens, the alcohol does not need to be chilled. Dehydrate thoroughly
to avoid milky ‘water spots’ in the mounted slides.
19 Clear by two transfers each at least 10 min through xylene.
Remarks: A prolonged stay in xylene (e.g. 2 d) sometimes produces extremely clear preparations.
20 Mount in synthetic neutral medium.
Remarks: Do not dry slides between steps 19 and 20! The mounting medium should be rather
viscous to avoid air-bubbles being formed when the solvent evaporates during drying. If air-bubbles
develop in the mounted and hardened slide, re-immerse in xylene for some days until the coverslip
drops off. Remount using a more viscous medium and remove materials protruding from the gelatin.
Usually, some air bubbles are found immediately after mounting; they can be pushed to the edge of
the coverslip with a finger or mounted needle. The preparation is stable. However, the drop margin
may bleach more or less. The infraciliature should stand out dark brown or black against the light
brown gelatin and the unstained cytoplasm. Silver deposits on the gelatin surface indicate that too
much Da Fano’s fluid remained (steps 7–9). Very rarely, the impregnation is too intense, especially
in large species.

fixations; use fume hood)

3.3.2.5 The silver carbonate methods
Because of the large quantity of cells needed for the basic Fernández-Galiano (1976) technique,
Augustin et al. (1984) proposed a modification which requires only few specimens and may
also yield permanent slides. Although the results are highly variable with all modifications, the
method is worthwhile because it works very fast and often produces excellent impregnations,
especially with hymenostomes (e.g. Tetrahymena, Paramecium), holophryids (e.g. Holophrya),
colpodids (e.g. Colpoda, Bryometopus, Platyophrya) and heterotrichs (e.g. Stentor). Fixation is
by formalin, which means that the shape of the cells is poorly preserved and even destroyed (cells
burst) in some species (e.g. most hypotrichs). The cells swell strongly during the preparation
process and become very soft being easily flattened between slide and coverslip. This makes
photographic documentation easy but may result in interpretation errors. The silver carbonate
methods reveal the infraciliature and certain cortical and cytoplasmic structures, especially the
kinetodesmal fibres and the nuclear apparatus. The silverlines in most cases do not impregnate.
Several modifications have been suggested (Wilbert 1983, Wolska 1966). Ma et al. (2003) provide
a protocol for marine ciliates. Independently, I developed the same protocol and can state that
it works well. However, permanent preparations loose quality, as with the Augustin method (see
step 5). For examples, see Fig. 2a, b, h in this work and figures 5, 6, 11, 18 and 27 in Foissner
(1991).
Procedure (after Augustin et al. 1984)
1 Place a droplet (about 0.05 ml or less) of a rich ciliate culture or even single specimens on a slide.
Remarks: The slide need not be grease-free. The middle-third should be delimited by lines drawn
with a greasy fingertip or a wax crayon to prevent solutions from spreading over the whole slide.
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 21–53 / 36

Chapter 3: Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa
2 Add 1–2 drops of formalin (about 4%) and fix for 1–3 min. Mix organisms with formalin by
swiveling the slide.
Remarks: The duration of this step may greatly influence the results. Species with a firm cortex
(or resting cysts) usually need to be fixed longer (≥3 min) than those with a more fragile cortex (≤1
min). Some species cannot be fixed well with formalin and cells may even burst. For these species,
fixation with osmium tetroxide vapours is sometimes useful (place inverted slide with ciliates over
a 4% osmium tetroxide solution in a fume hood for about 1 min). Fix as usual with formalin after
osmium treatment.
3 Add 1–3 drops of Fernández-Galiano’s fluid to the fixed ciliates, without washing out the
formalin, and mix by swiveling the slide for 10–60 s.
Remarks: The amount of Fernández-Galiano’s fluid needed depends on many unpredictable
factors (e.g. amount and concentration of fixative, size of drops, kind of species and composition of
sample fluid). 1–3 drops usually work well. The same holds for the reaction time (10–60 s). The trial
and error method must frequently be used to obtain best results!
4 Place slide on a preheated (60–70 °C) hotplate and leave until the drop, which is now rather
large, turns golden brown (like cognac). This usually takes 2–4 min and the slide must be kept
in constant circular motion during this time. As soon as the drop appears cognac-coloured,
check impregnation with the compound microscope. Replace the slide on the hotplate if the
impregnation is too faint; if it is already too dark repeat the procedure, starting with step 1, but
vary amount of Fernández-Galiano’s solution and/or impregnation time etc. If the preparation is
too faint, specimens can be put on a new slide and the procedure repeated beginning with step 2.
Remarks: The correct impregnation time depends on many factors which are difficult to
control (size of drops, temperature, kind of species, etc.). The ratio of the components in the
Fernández-Galiano fluid is especially important. Add, e.g. some drops of pyridine and/or silver
carbonate solution to the Fernández-Galiano fluid if the impregnation is repeatedly too faint, i.e.
cannot be intensified by prolonged heating. Fix ciliates in 2 or 3 drops of formalin instead of 1
or 2 drops if the impregnation is too faint. Ciliates from old cultures, ion-rich fluids (e.g. sewage,
soil) or anaerobic biotopes frequently impregnate poorly. For these, impregnation sometimes
improves if they are washed prior to fixation (fluid from sample and distilled water 1:1).
5 Interrupt impregnation by removing the slide from the hotplate and add a drop of fixative
(sodium thiosulfate).
Remarks: The preparation is now ready. Augustin et al. (1984) describe a method for obtaining
permanent slides. Their quality is, however, often not as good as with wet (fresh) preparations,
which are thus usually preferred for investigation and photography. Pick out some well impregnated
specimens with a micropipette, place them on a clean slide and cover with a coverslip. For good
pictures, the drop with the selected specimens should be very small so that cells are compressed
between slide and coverslip. Excess fluid may be removed from the edge of the coverslip using a
piece of filter paper. The impregnation need not be fixed with sodium thiosulfate if the investigation
is undertaken immediately. The impregnation is stable for some hours when stored in a moist
chamber. I recommend that the cells be compressed between the slide and coverslip immediately
after the impregnation since silver precipitates may occur with time in the reaction fluid.

3.3.2.6 Protargol methods
Protargol methods are indispensable for descriptive research on ciliates. The first protocols were
provided by Kirby (1945), Moskowitz (1950), Dragesco (1962) and Tuffrau (1964, 1967), and
many more modifications were subsequently proposed (Aufderheide 1982, Dieckmann 1995,
Dragesco & Dragesco-Kernéis 1986, McCoy 1974, Ng & Nelsen 1977, Wilbert 1975, 1976,
Zagon 1970). Protocols for quantitative protargol stains (QPS) have been published by, for
example, Montagnes & Lynn (1987) and Skibbe (1994). Here, three qualitative variations which
produce good results in our laboratory are described. These protocols work well with most ciliate
species (some, however, only rarely impregnate well, e.g. Loxodes, Paramecium) but require at
least 20 specimens. Contrary to the silver carbonate method, single specimens cannot usually be
handled successfully. Depending on the procedure used, protargol can reveal many cortical and
internal structures, such as basal bodies, cilia, various fibrillar systems, and the nuclear apparatus.
The silverlines, however, never impregnate. The shape of the cells is usually well-preserved
in permanent slides, which is an advantage for the investigation but makes photographic
documentation more difficult. However, pictures as clear as those taken from wet silver carbonate
impregnations can be obtained with the Wilbert modification if the cells are photographed prior
to embedding in the albumin glycerol. This applies also to my protocol (see step 12).
The more recent preparations were done with the method described now. It differs from my
1991 protocol in some small but important details: instead of using distilled water, tap water is used
in most steps. This avoids swelling and detachment of the albumin, the main problem in the 1991
protocol. In addition, ‘new’ fixatives and a second developer, which often produces more contrast,
are introduced.

Chapter 3: Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa
The quality of the slides is usually adequate but frequently not as good as with the Wilbert
modification. The latter demands more material and experience; inexperienced workers may
easily lose the material. As in all protargol methods, the procedure is rather time-consuming and
complicated. Experiments with students showed that beginners have a fair chance of obtaining
good slides (for example, figure 31 in Foissner 1991). A centrifuge may be used for step 2; staining
jars (Fig. 1e) are necessary for steps 6–16. The procedure is complex and subject to many factors.
Thus, be well-organized and study ‘Remarks’ carefully. For examples see procedure B.
Procedure A
1 Fix organisms in Bouin’s or Stieve’s fluid or in alcohol (50–100% depending on species and
material), alcohol/formalin solution (see below), formalin (~4%), or in other fixatives for 10–30
min.
Remarks: To use an appropriate fixative is of paramount significance. Surprisingly, simple
alcohol frequently provides excellent impregnations, although shrinkage may be rather pronounced.
Alcohol/formalin and Champy’s or Da Fano’s fixatives are sometimes also useful. The fixation time
has little influence on the quality of the preparation within the limits given. The ratio of fixative to
sample fluid should be at least 1:1. Pour ciliates into the fixative, using a wide-necked dish to bring
the organisms in contact with the fixative as fast as possible. Most fixatives may be supplemented
with some drops of 2% osmium tetroxide for better fixation of fragile ciliates, e.g. the hypotrich
Urosoma, which, however, fixes perfectly with alcohol. This increases the stability of the cells but
usually reduces their impregnability.
2 Concentrate specimens by centrifugation and wash 3 or 4 times in tap water.
Remarks: There are now two choices: either continue with step 3 or transfer the material through
30–50–70% alcohol (ethanol) where it remains stable for years. Transfer preserved material
back through the graded alcohol series into tap water prior to continuing with the next step. The
impregnability of preserved material may be slightly different.
3 Clean eight slides (or less if material is very scarce) per sample. The slides must be grease-free
(clean with alcohol and flame or use pre-cleaned slides).
Remarks: Insufficiently cleaned slides may cause the albumin to detach. Mark slides on back with
a diamond scribe if several samples are prepared together. We use staining jars with eight sections so
that we can work with 16 slides simultaneously by putting them back to back (Fig. 1e).
4 Place a small drop each of albumin-glycerol and concentrated organisms in the centre of a slide.
Mix drops with a mounted needle and spread over the middle-third of the slide.
Remarks: Use approximately equal-sized drops of albumin-glycerol and suspended (in tap water)
organisms to facilitate spreading. The size of the drops should be adjusted so that the middle-third
of the slide is covered after spreading. Now remove sand grains, etc. The thickness of the albumin
layer should be equal to that of the organisms. Some thicker and thinner slides should, however, also
be prepared because the thickness of the albumin layer may influence the quality of the preparation.
Cells may partially dry out and/or shrink if the albumin layer is too thin; if it is too thick, it may
detach or the cells cannot be studied with the oil immersion objective.
5 Allow slides to dry for at least 2 h or overnight at room temperature.
Remarks: Slides may be allowed to dry for up to 48 h; longer times decrease quality. Oven-dried
(2 h at 60 °C) slides are usually also of poorer quality.
6 Place slides in a staining jar (Fig. 1e) filled with 95% alcohol (ethanol) for 20–30 min. Place a
staining jar with protargol solution into an oven (60 °C).
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 21–53 / 39

Foissner Wilhelm
Remarks: Slides should not be transferred through an alcohol series into concentrated alcohol
as this causes the albumin layer to detach. Decrease hardening time to 15–20 min if the albumin is
rather old and/or not very sticky.
7 Rehydrate slides through 70% alcohol and two tap water steps for 5 min each.
8 Place slides in 0.2% potassium permanganate solution. Remove first slide (or pair of slides) after
30 s and the others at 15 s intervals. Collect slides in a staining jar filled with tap water.
Remarks: Bleaching is by permanganate and oxalic acid (step 9). The procedure described above
is necessary because each species has its optimum bleaching time. The sequence in which slides are
treated should be recorded as the immersion time in oxalic acid must be proportional to that in the
permanganate solution. The albumin layer containing the organisms should swell slightly in the
permanganate solution and the surface should become uneven. If it remains smooth, the albumin is
too sticky and this could decrease the quality of the impregnation. If the albumin swells strongly, it
is possibly too weak (old) and liable to detach. Use fresh potassium permanganate solution for each
series.
9 Transfer slides to 2.5% oxalic acid. Remove first slides (or pair of slides) after 60, 90, 120 and 160
s, the others at 20 s intervals. Collect slides in a staining jar filled with tap water.
Remarks: Same as for step 8! The albumin layer becomes smooth in oxalic acid. Hard tap water
should be mixed with distilled water 1:1.
10 Wash slides twice in tap water and once in distilled water for 3 min each.
11 Place slides in the warm (~60°C) protargol solution and impregnate for 10–15 min.
Remarks: The protargol solution can be used only once. Organize seven staining jars for
developing the slides: distilled water – tap water – tap water – fixative (sodium thiosulfate) – tap
water – 70% alcohol – 100% alcohol (ethanol).
12 Remove the staining jar from the oven and take one slide from the mid of the series for adjusting
the developer. Dip the slide into distilled water for 1–2 s and then transfer it into the acetone
developer. As soon as the albumin turns yellowish, remove the slide, dip it into the first two tap
water steps for about 2 s each, and control the impregnation with the compound microscope. If
the cells appear impregnated, then submerge the slide into the fixative (sodium thiosulfate) for
10 min. If the cells appear not or too faintly impregnated, then take a second slide and do the
same procedure with the ordinary developer. If necessary, adjust the developer (see reagents) and
continue to develop the rest of the slides; collect the slides in the fixative.
Remarks: We now use two different developers: the ordinary one and that proposed by Dieckmann
(1995), which is preferable but, for unknown reasons, does not work with all materials and fixatives.
For instance, it sometimes does not work with material that was not stored in 70% alcohol for a few
days. Despite of this problem, the Dieckmann developer should be tried first because it impregnates
the cytoplasm weaker than the ordinary developer, enhancing the contrast of the preparation. The
impregnation intensity is sufficient if the ciliary pattern is just recognizable. The permanent slide
will be too dark if the ciliary pattern is distinct at this stage of the procedure. The intensity of the
impregnation can be controlled by the concentration of the developer and the time of development:
5–10 s usually suffice for the diluted ordinary developer, while 20 s to 5 min, usually about 1–2
min, are needed with the acetone developer. Some species (e.g. most microthoracids) must be
treated with undiluted developer. Development time increases with bleaching time. The thinner the
albumin layer, the faster the development.
To obtain excellent micrographs use the following method: scrap off the albumin layer, put it in
distilled water, and suck it through an ordinary Pasteur pipette several times to isolate specimens

Chapter 3: Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa
from the albumin. Take out well-impregnated cells and put them on a slide with very little water.
Add a coverslip which will flatten and enlarge the cells so that good micrographs can be made.
13 Fix slides in sodium thiosulfate for 10 min. Then wash in tap water three times for about 5 min
each.
Remarks: Both, sufficient fixation and thorough washout of the fixative are of paramount
importance for the stability of the preparation.
14 Transfer slides to 70% – 100% – 100% alcohol for 3–5 min each.
15 Clear by two 10 min transfers through xylene.
16 Mount in synthetic neutral medium.
Remarks: Do not dry slides between steps 15 and 16. The preparation is stable, provided step 13
is done correctly. The mounting medium should be rather viscous to avoid air-bubbles being formed
when the solvent evaporates during drying.

c Alcohol/formalin solution (prepare immediately before use; components can be stored)
50 ml 70% alcohol (ethanol)
5 ml formalin (HCHO; commercial concentration, about 37%)
Remarks: The two components can be used in a wide variety of concentrations, even vice versa.
Furthermore, they can be used individually in various concentrations. The often excellent results
obtained with pure alcohol fixation are partially caused by the poor preservation of the cytoplasm,
which then impregnates only faintly, enhancing the contrast of the cortical structures.
d Albumin-glycerol (2–6 month stable at 3 °C)
15 ml egg albumin
15 ml concentrated (98–100%) glycerol (C H O )
3 8 3
Remarks: Pre-treatment of the egg albumin and preparation of the albumin-glycerol: separate
the white carefully from the yolk and embryo of three eggs (free range eggs are preferable to
those from battery chickens, whose egg white is less sticky). Shake the white by hand (do not use
a mixer!) for about 1 min in a narrow-mouthed 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask until a stiff white foam
is formed. Allow the flask to stand for 30–60 s. Then pour the viscous rest of the egg white in a
second Erlenmeyer flask and shake again until a stiff foam is formed. Repeat until most of the egg
white is either stiff or becomes watery; usually 4–6 Erlenmeyer flasks of foam are obtained. Leave
all flasks undisturbed for about 10 min and discard the watery albumin from the last flask. During
this time a glycerol-like fluid percolates from the foam. This fluid is collected and used. Add an
equal volume of concentrated glycerol and a small thymol crystal (C H O) for preservation of
10 14
the mixture. Mix by shaking gently and pour mixture into a small flask. Leave undisturbed for two
weeks in the refrigerator. A whitish slime settles at the bottom of the flask. Decant the clear portion,
discard slime and thymol crystal. Store the clear portion at about 3 °C. A ‘good’ albumin-glycerol

drags a short thread when touched with a needle. The albumin is too thin (not sticky enough) or
too old if this thread is not formed. Fresh albumin which is too thin may be concentrated by leaving
the flask open for some weeks so that water can evaporate. If the albumin is too sticky, which may
result in only one side of the organisms impregnating well, it is diluted with distilled water or old,
less sticky albumin to the appropriate consistency. The preparation of the albumin-glycerol must
be undertaken with great care because much depends on its quality. Unfortunately, all commercial
products which I have tried detached during the following steps.
e 0.2% potassium permanganate solution (stable for about1 d)
0.2 g potassium permanganate (KMnO ) dissolved in 100 ml distilled water
4
f 2.5% oxalic acid solution (stable for about 1 d)
2.5 g oxalic acid (C H O .2H O) dissolved in 100 ml distilled water
2 2 4 2
g 0.4–0.8% protargol solution (stable for about 1 week when not heated)
100 ml distilled water
add 0.4–0.8 g protargol
Remarks: Use light brown ‘protargol for microscopy’ presently not available but a protocol
has been published by Pan et al. (2013). Some dark-brown, cheap products do not work! Sprinkle
powder on the surface of the water of a wide-mouthed bottle and allow to dissolve without stirring.
The concentration of the protargol depends on its ‘strength’, that is, on the silver contents.
h Ordinary developer (mix in sequence indicated; sodium sulfite must be dissolved before
hydroquinone is added).
95 ml distilled water
5 g sodium sulfite (Na SO )
2 3
1 g hydroquinone (C H O )
6 6 2
Remarks: This recipe yields the stock solution which is stable for some weeks and should be
used undiluted for certain ciliates (step 12). Usually, however, it must be diluted with tap water in a
ratio of 1:20 to 1:50 to avoid too rapid development and one-sided impregnation of the organisms.
Freshly prepared developer is usually inadequate (the albumin turns greenish instead of brownish).
The developer should thus be aged artificially by adding some sodium carbonate (Na CO ) or by
2 3
adding about 1 ml old, slightly brownish stock solution to 100 ml fresh developer. Alternatively,
air-aged solutions can be used, that is, a developer that has been kept uncovered for one to two
days in a wide-mouthed bottle. It first turns yellowish, then light brown (most effective) and later
dark brown and viscous (at this stage the developer has lost most of its activity but is still suitable
for artificial ageing of fresh developer; see above). Take great care with the developer as its quality
contributes highly to that of the slides. If the developer has lost its activity (which is not always
indicated by a brown colour!), the silver is not or only insufficiently reduced and the organisms
impregnate too faintly. Fresh developer should therefore be prepared for each ‘impregnation week’
and some old developer kept.

each before adding the next)

from Fryd-Versavel (personal communication). Pour the developer into a staining jar and immerse

slides, one by one, controlling impregnation intensity when the albumin becomes light brown or
light green. See step 12 for details.
j Fixative for impregnation (stable for years)
Dissolve 150 g sodium thiosulfate (Na S O ·5H O) in 1000 ml distilled water
2 2 3 2
Procedure B (after Wilbert 1975 and personal experience)
This modification produces excellent results but demands much experience. I manipulate large
cells with micropipettes in a watch-glass (Fig. 1f), whereas the centrifuge is used for steps 1–4
and 7–8 if cells are smaller than about 150 µm. The watch-glass method is also used when
there are only a few specimens of larger cells. The organisms are very soft after development
and fixation and are thus easily compressed between slide and coverslip, which greatly facilitates
photographic documentation. For examples, see Fig. 2d, f in this monograph and figures 12, 22,
25 and 31–33 in Foissner (1991).
1 Fix organisms as described in protargol procedure A (Foissner’s modification).
2 Wash and, if so desired, preserve organisms as described in procedure A (Foissner’s modification).
Remarks: Wash cells either in the centrifuge (small species) or in a watch-glass (Fig. 1f). To change
fluids allow cells to settle on bottom of watch-glass and remove supernatant with a micropipette
under the dissecting microscope; concentrate cells in the centre of the watch- glass by gentle swirling.
3 Transfer organisms with a small amount of distilled water to an at least 10-fold quantity of
sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and bleach for about 3 min.
Remarks: This is the critical step in this modification. If bleaching is too strong or too weak all is
lost: cells either dissolve or do not impregnate well. Systematic investigations showed that not the
bleaching time but the amount of active chloride in the sodium hypochlorite and the pre-treatment
of the cells (fixation fluid, fresh or preserved material) are decisive for the quality of the preparation.
Different species need different concentrations. Unfortunately, the concentration of active chloride
in the commercial products varies (10–13%) and is dependent on the age of the fluid. It is thus
impossible to provide more than only a few guidelines: 100 ml distilled water + 0.2–0.4 ml NaClO
(if product is fresh and cells were not stored in alcohol) or 100 ml distilled water + 0.5–1.6 ml
NaClO (if product is older and cells were stored in alcohol). The transparency of the cells under
the dissecting microscope may serve as a further indicator: fixed, unbleached cells appear dark and
opaque whereas accurately bleached cells are almost colourless and rather transparent (depends,
however, also on size and thickness of the cells). Thus, increase the concentration of sodium
hypochlorite stepwise if cells appear too dark with the recommended concentrations. I routinely
start with three different hypochlorite concentrations if sufficient material is available.
4 Wash organisms at least three times with distilled water and finally once in the protargol solution.
Remarks: Wash thoroughly, especially when fluids are changed with micropipettes, because even
the slightest traces of sodium hypochlorite disturb the impregnation.
5 Transfer to 1% protargol solution and impregnate for 10–20 min at 60 °C.
Remarks: This and the next step should be carried out in a watch-glass even for material which
is otherwise manipulated with the centrifuge. The impregnation time depends on the kind of
material and the degree of bleaching. Check the progress of impregnation every 3–4 min under
the compound microscope by picking out a few cells with the micropipette under the dissecting
microscope; add these to a drop of developer. Dilute developer and/or interrupt development by
adding some fixative (sodium thiosulfate) if impregnation is sufficiently intense.
6 Remove most of the protargol solution with a micropipette and add 5–15 drops of developer to
the remainder containing the organisms.
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 21–53 / 43

Foissner Wilhelm
Remarks: Fresh, undiluted developer is usually used (but see step 5). Control development
in a compound or dissecting microscope. As soon as the infraciliature becomes faintly visible,
development must be stopped by adding some drops of sodium thiosulfate. Judging the right
moment is a question of experience; the permanent slide will be too dark if the infraciliature is very
distinct at this stage of the procedure.
7 Stabilize the impregnation by two approximately 5 min transfers through sodium thiosulfate.
Remarks: The developer needs not be removed before fixation. For small species this and the
next step can be carried out in a centrifuge. Larger species must be manipulated with micropipettes
because cells are now very fragile and would be damaged in the centrifuge. Cells are very soft at
this stage and can thus be easily compressed and photographed. Transfer some of the more darkly
impregnated specimens with a very small amount of fixative onto a clean slide, using a micropipette
and cover with a coverslip. Organisms are usually flattened by the weight of the coverslip; excess
fluid may be removed from the edge of the coverslip with a piece of filter paper.
8 Wash very thoroughly in distilled water (three times with the centrifuge; 7–10 times in watch-
glass with a micropipette) or in tap water (when cells appear strongly inflated and tend to burst
or dissolve in distilled water). Finally remove most water.
Remarks: Even the slightest traces of the fixative destroy the impregnation within a few days or
weeks.
9 Smear a moderately thick layer of albumin-glycerol on a clean slide with a finger. Drop the
impregnated, washed cells on the albumized slide with a large-bore pipette (opening ~1 mm)
and air-dry the preparation for at least 2 h.
Remarks: The cells are too fragile to be spread with a needle. With much care it is possible to
orientate cells using a mounted eyelash. Commercial albumin-glycerol can be used.
10 Harden albumin by two 10 min transfers through concentrated alcohol (propanol or ethanol).
Remarks: This and the next step are best carried out in staining jars. The albumin layer turns
milky and opaque.
11 Clear by two 5 min transfers through xylene.
Remarks: The albumin layer turns transparent.
12 Mount in synthetic neutral medium.
Remarks: Same as for step 20 of the wet silver nitrate method.
Reagents
If not stated otherwise, the same reagents as in the first protargol procedure (Foissner’s modifica-
tion) are to be used.
Procedure C (for few specimens)
I learned this simple modification in Dr P. Didier’s laboratory (Clermont-Ferrand University,
France). It sometimes produces excellent impregnations, especially with species having a firm pellicle
(e.g. microthoracids). It also demands little material because the specimens are mounted on the slide
without washing.
1 Collect specimens with a micropipette and place them in the centre of a grease-free slide. Remove
excess fluid as far as possible.
2 Fumigate cells with 4% aqueous osmium tetroxide for about 2 min.
Remarks: Hold inverted slide close to the osmium tetroxide. Carry out the procedure in a fume
hood as osmic acid vapours are highly toxic.
3 Add an equal-sized drop of albumin-glycerol, mix thoroughly but gently with a mounted needle
and spread the mixture in a moderately thin layer over the middle third of the slide.
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 21–53 / 44

Chapter 3: Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa
Remarks: The albumin-glycerol must be prepared as described in the first protargol procedure
(Foissner’s modification). Cells are very fragile and frequently break or dissolve.
4 Allow to dry for about 4 h.
5 Proceed with steps 6 (coagulation of albumin in concentrated alcohol) to 16 of the first protargol
procedure (Foissner’s modification). Bleaching times are usually about 50% shorter than with my
modification.
3.3.2.7 Preparation for scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
Ciliate species cannot be identified solely by SEM because only a limited number of characteristics
are revealed. However, SEM is useful for the beginner by allowing a three-dimensional view of the
specimens and for the specialist in documenting details which are difficult to reveal with other
methods. Only the method used by ourselves is described here; it has changed considerably since
Foissner (1991). See textbooks for general SEM techniques. For examples see Fig. 4a–e, 5a, b in this
work and figures 2–4, 13, 14, 21, 24, 30, 34 and 37 in Foissner (1991).
Procedure
1 Pour ciliates into Parducz’ fixative and leave for about 30 min.
Remarks: Concentrate and clean material as thoroughly as possible (see step 2). The ratio of
sample to fixative should be at least 1:1, better 1:2. Add some drops of 5M HCl if fixative becomes
milky when the material is added. Fixation must be done in a wide-mouthed bottle so that the
organisms come in contact with the fixative immediately. Then put the fixed sample in a narrow
glass tube (diameter ~2 cm), where the organisms can settle. Parducz’ fluid preserves most ciliates
very well. However, the cirri of hypotrich ciliates usually disintegrate into their component cilia.
Thus, they should be fixed either in concentrated mercury chloride (dissolve 60 g HgCl in 1 l
2
hot distilled water and allow to cool) or in a mixture composed of 4 parts concentrated mercury
chloride and 1 part 2% osmium tetroxide. A much better fixative for hypotrichs is that used by
Barry Wicklow (personal communication): mix equal amounts of 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide
and 3% glutaraldehyde and fix cells for 15–30 min. Wash in distilled water and proceed as described
below (steps 2–7). Unfortunately, such material cannot be stored because crystals are formed. Thus,
critical-point drying must follow immediately. This fixative also preserves many other ciliates well
although the metachronal ciliary waves are frequently not as distinct as with Parducz’ fluid.
2 Wash and clean the material (ciliates or other protists) in tap water.
Remarks: Washing must be done in a watch-glass (Fig. 1f) and with a micropipette to remove
bacteria and debris. This cleaning of the material is essential but rather difficult and laborious,
especially with small species (<100 µm) and field material; thus, cultures and/or pre-cleaned
material (see below) should be used. The cleaning is performed as follows: ciliates have settled at the
bottom of the tube after 30 min (step 1). Remove as much supernatant as possible with a pipette
(use a centrifuge only if the specimens did not settle well). Then transfer the material to a watch-
glass and allow to settle for about 5 min (use fume hood). Quickly remove most of the fixative with
a micropipette under the dissecting microscope. Now wash the ciliates with tap water by several
passages through a large-bore pipette (diameter about 1 mm). Bacteria and debris adhering to the
ciliates are hereby mechanically removed. Again, allow to settle, but control sedimentation with
the dissecting microscope; remove supernatant containing bacteria and debris with a micropipette
as soon as ciliates have settled. This procedure must be repeated until the material is clean. Use
fractionated sedimentation if the sample contains several species differing in size and/or mass.
Field material: Larger species (>100 µm) are picked out with a micropipette and collected in
a small bottle. Then pour the fixative over the cells. Several hundred specimens must be collected

because loss of material may be considerable during the following steps. Small species can be prepared
by this method only if abundant material is available. Some accumulation can often be achieved
by the following simple method: leave a freshly collected sample containing ample mud to stand

Chapter 3: Microscopic methods for taxonomic studies of ciliated protozoa
for some hours at room temperature. Due to oxygen
depletion the ciliates usually move to the surface where
they can be skimmed off with a teaspoon.
The cleaned material can be stored in ~1% osmium
tetroxide for years. However, when the fixative
contained aldehydes (formalin, glutaraldehyde), the
osmium should be changed two or three times within
the first month, otherwise it becomes black from
remnants of the fixative and crystals are formed.
3 Transfer the cleaned ciliates with a small drop of tap
water into the preparation chamber (Fig. 7).
Remarks: Place a small amount of commercial
cotton wool on the bottom plankton net of the
chamber. Then put a drop of specimens on the cotton
and load the preparation with washer 1. The net must
be dry to avoid spreading of the drop to the chamber
margin and the washer. Place the top plankton net
carefully on the drop, that is, on washer 1, using
forceps. Weight top net with washer 2, close chamber

They are stable for years.
4 Dehydrate chamber with ciliates in an ethanol series (30–50–70–90–100–100%) for 5 min
each.
5 Dry chamber with ciliates in a critical-point drying apparatus.
Remarks: We use CO and change the alcohol at least 10 times. Amylacetate, as used previously
2
(Foissner 1991), proved to be superfluous.
6 Use a mouth protection fabric to the end of the protocol and put a glass shield between the
dissecting microscope and the sample to avoid any rewetting of the dried organisms by your
breath! Open chamber and place ciliates on a SEM-stub.
Remarks: The dried ciliates usually form small lumps in the cotton wool. The cotton and the
net are carefully transferred with forceps to the SEM-stub, where the organisms are separated from
the cotton and the net by knocking on the forceps. If small lumps of organisms remain, they can
be dispersed with a mounted eyelash under the dissecting microscope. The ciliates spread easily if
cleaning and drying were sufficient.
Preparation of the SEM-stub: We use commercial aluminium SEM-stubs, 25 mm diameter. To
fix the organisms and to get a black, homogeneous background, the stub is covered with a graphite
tab available from several providers, e.g. Christine Gröpl, Austria (order no. G 3347 or G 3348, for
tabs with 12 or 25 mm diameter, respectively). Note that small species (<30 µm) tend to sink into
the graphite. For these, the graphite tab is pre-sputtered three times with gold.
7 Sputter with gold. This is a very critical step! Use low (4 mA) sputter energy. Sputter about
10 times for 30 s each, with breaks of about 5 min to avoid heating. Cilia become curled and

denatured if sputter energy is too high and/or the sample is slightly rewetted by your breath
or perspiration when you transfer the stub into the microscope!
Remarks: Use a mouth protection fabric when transferring the sample into the SEM.
Reagents

4 ml aqueous 2% osmium tetroxide (OsO )

1 ml saturated, aqueous mercuric chloride (HgCl ; for preparation see protargol protocol)

3.3.3 Deciliation of ciliates for scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The methods available for deciliation of ciliates are either rather complex or very specific, that is,
deciliate only certain species, usually Tetrahymena or Paramecium (Nelson 1995, Thompson et al.
1974). In searching for an easier and better method, I obtained excellent results for rather many
taxa with ordinary liquid soap. Experiments with 30 surfactants showed that many have deciliating
properties, but excellent results were obtained only with liquid soap (Teepol, see below), Marlon
AS3, and Nonidet P40. The method is quite simple and produces pictures of unseen clarity, although
the adoral membranelles are rarely completely deciliated, showing that their cilia have different
properties (Fig. 6 and Quintela-Alonso et al. 2013).
Procedure
1 Use dense cultures or concentrate ciliates by mild centrifugation (~1500 rpm).
2 Transfer ciliates with about 1 ml of medium into a watch-glass and add 1 ml deciliation fluid.
Mix by moving the watch-glass.
3 Control deciliation under the dissecting microscope. As soon as most specimens have become
motionless and sink to the bottom of the watch-glass, usually within 30–90 s, put the sample
into 3–4 ml of Parducz’ fixative for about 30 min.
4 Proceed with step 2 of ‘Preparation for SEM’.
Remarks: To get sufficient material and some variation, two or three samples should be made
with either the same or different surfactants and united to a composite sample. Excellent results are
obtained with most Oligohymenophora (Fig. 6a, b, e–g) but Paramecium works only with Nonidet
(see below). Good results are obtained with some colpodids (Fig. 6c, d) and prostomatids, while
heterotrichs, hypotrichs and haptorids do not work, at least with the few species tested: Blepharisma,
Condylostomides, Sterkiella, Kahliella, Epispathidium, and Dileptus. With some patience, it may be
possible to find a surfactant or a compound surfactant which also deciliates these ciliates.
Reagents
a Parducz’ fixative as described in ‘Preparation for SEM’
b Deciliation reagents. Add to 1 l tap water either 0.5 ml Teepol, 0.005–0.050 ml Marlon AS3, or
0.25 ml Nonidet P40
Remarks: Teepol, the liquid soap, can be obtained in drugstores in Austria or from the distributer:
Sara Lee HBC, Austria. Teepol consists of three surfactants: sodiumlaurylethersulfat (CAS-No.:
68891-38-3), alkylpolyglycolether (CAS-No.: 68131-39-5) and alkylbenzenesulfonic acid (CAS-
No.: 85117-49-3). Experiments showed that the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid is the main deciliating
agent. It is distributed under the commercial name MARLON AS3 by Sasol, Germany. Nonidet
P40, which works as well as Teepol, is a compound surfactant composed of 15 homologues and
distributed by AppliChem, Germany.

Fig. 8. Labelling of permanent preparations (slides).
3.4 Labelling and deposition of preparations
3.4.1 Labelling
Concise labelling of the slides is important. However, the most important information must be
selected because of the restricted space on the microscope slide. I label the slides usually as shown
in Fig. 8. If necessary, additional information can be provided in the publication and/or on a stiff
paper slide. Clean the slide carefully and then mark the specimens on the coverslip with a sharp pen
using Indian ink. Avoid artificial ink because it usually bleaches within a few years.
3.4.2 Deposition
Corliss (1963) was among the first who emphasized the deposition of permanent preparations of
new or reinvestigated ciliates in acknowledged repositories. His appeal was successful, i.e. most
scientific journals now require the deposition of type slides (Lynn & Simpson 2009), and the
discussion of the scientific value of types has been rejuvenated (Aescht 2008).
Basically, there are three kinds of types in ciliates (for details, see ICZN 1999). Briefly, the
holotype is the one specimen or illustration designated by the author as the nomenclatural type
(type specimen, name-bearing type). All specimens other than the holotype are paratypes, i.e.
the holotype and the paratype(s)1 are from the same population and (type) locality. Vouchers,
in contrast, are from other populations and localities. Typification guidelines and acknowledged
repositories for preparations of unicellular organisms have been compiled by Aescht (2008).
Any kind of type should be deposited in an appropriate slide box and in an acknowledged
repository, usually a museum of natural history. Avoid deposition in the laboratory because your
follower may be ignorant of the importance of types and thus may dispose of the slides.
1 Note by H. Berger: For exact definition of paratype and type series, see ICZN (1999, Articles 7.24, Glossary).

4.2 Description of taxa1
4.2.1 Gymnostomatea
For some recent comments on this taxon by W. Foissner, see Foissner (2016, p. 49).
Enchelariophrya Foissner, 2016
Remarks: The new species discovered, Enchelariophrya jamaicensis, stimulated me to re-investigate
the materials from Enchelys micrographica Foissner, 2010, especially the oral structures which are
very difficult to recognize due to the narrow setting between oral bulge and body proper (Fig. 1a–c,
2a–c, e, 3a, d, e, j, k, m, q, r). However, with some effort, I could produce very detailed photographs,
showing a single dikinetid, which produces an oral basket rod at anterior end of each ciliary row
and close to the first kinetid of the ciliary rows (Fig. 1d, 3e, f, j, k, m, n, q, r). Thus, oralized somatic
kinetids, as suggested by Foissner (2010, Fig. 12), are absent.
A very similar pattern occurs in the genus Semispathidium Foissner, Agatha & Berger, 2002.
However, Semispathidium species still have a minute gap between the somatic kineties and the
circumoral kinety (Foissner et al. 2002, 2010; Vd’ačný & Foissner 2013; Vd’ačný et al. 2014a) and
have much more circumoral dikinetids than somatic kineties. Further, all described Enchelariophrya
species have a pyriform body shape and an acentric oral opening while Semispathidium species are
rod-shaped and have a central oral opening. Thus, it is unlikely that Enchelariophrya is a junior
synonym of Semispathidium.
Enchelariophrya micrographica (Foissner, 2010) nov. comb.
(Fig. 1a, f, 2g, j, 3j–r, 9g–k; Table 1 on p. 308)
2010 Enchelys micrographica nov. spec. — Foissner, MittBl. Mikroskop. Ges. Wien, Festschrift, November 2010: 72 (ori-
ginal description).
Remarks: The discovery of → Enchelariophrya jamaicensis stimulated me to re-investigate the
live micrographs of the extrusomes (Fig. 2j) and the protargol preparations of Enchelariophrya
micrographica. As concerns the extrusomes, they are thicker in E. micrographica than in E.
jamaicensis (in vivo 3.0–4.0 × 0.5–0.8 µm vs. about 3.0 × 0.4 µm; cp. Fig. 1f, 2j with Fig. 1e, 2h).
The second problem, viz., the structure of the oral ciliature, could be solved by stacked micrographs
of E. micrographica and E. jamaicensis (see above and Fig. 1d, 2e, f, j, k, m, q, r).
1 Note by H. Berger: The arrangement (classification) of the taxa within this work was not yet fixed by W. Foissner.
Thus, I arranged them basically as in Foissner et al. (2002) and Foissner (2016). In addition, W. Foissner did not yet
write comments to the higher taxa as he did it in Foissner (2016). I added some brief hints (see, for example, chapter
4.2.1 above). An arrow ahead of a certain taxon means that it is described in the present work. The “Type locality” and
“Occurrence and ecology” sections sometimes contain sample numbers (e.g., “Australian site (30)”). Foissner did not
yet compile a table/list with a detailed description of these samples as he did it in his other monographs (e.g., Foissner
2016). I did not delete them, although they have no meaning in the present work. Perhaps I can provide such a list in a
later work. The present chapter also contains the description of a new Microsporidium species, which follows immedia-
tely the host species, a new Protocyclidium species.
The work contains 204 plates, but relatively little text. Therefore I have added the tables with the morphometric charac-
terisations (Tables 1–37) at the end of the chapter (p. 307–345).

Enchelariophrya jamaicensis nov. spec.
(Fig. 1b, c, e, 2a–i, 3a–i; Table 1 on p. 308)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 135 × 45 µm. Usually pyriform with oral opening distinctly out of
pole centre. On average about 260 macronuclear nodules 3.8 × 3.2 µm in size. Extrusomes bluntly
fusiform and slightly curved, about 3.0 × 0.4 µm in size. Cortical granulation very dense, plate-like.
On average 41 ciliary rows; middle row of dorsal brush extends about 32% of body length. Spines
of resting cyst about 13 µm long.
Type locality: Humous surface soil (0–5 cm) around an Aechmea paniculigera (Bromeliacea) in
the outskirt of the village of Quick Step in Cockpit Country, Jamaica, 18°17'N, 77°41'W.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype (Fig. 1c, 3d) and three paratype slides with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and all paratype specimens have been marked with black ink
circles on the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 1a–e in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered, i.e., Jamaica.

Description and comparison with Enchelariophrya micrographica: Unfortunately, Enchel­
ariop hrya jamaicensis was very rare and the protargol preparations were mediocre. Thus, the mor-
phometry is incomplete (Table 1).
As concerns the general morphology and the in vivo aspect, I refer the reader to Figures 1
and 4 of E. micrographica in Foissner (2010). Details of E. jamaicensis and a comparison with E.
micrographica are shown by micrographs, the figure explanations, and the morphometric table.
Generally, the morphology of E. jamaicensis is highly similar to that of E. micrographica, both in
vivo and in protargol preparations. For feeding of E. micrographica, see → Enchelys australiensis
(Fig. 8g–k). Here, I mention only those features that help to separate E. jamaicensis from E.
micrographica (lined up according to importance; averages are given, see Table 1; E. jamaicensis
ahead): resting cyst spines (in vivo 13 µm vs. 3 µm; seen within cytoplasm and in a single mature

Fig. 3g–k. Enchelariophrya jamaicensis (g–i) and E. micrographica (j, k) after protargol impregnation. g: Overview,
showing a large food vacuole containing a decaying Frontonia depressa. This is remarkable, showing that the minute oral
bulge (Fig. 2a–c, e) can open widely. Note the globular to broadly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules. h, i: A specimen
with mainly elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules (h, 6.4 × 2.8 µm, n = 9; in two out of five cells) and another with
globular to broadly ellipsoid nodules (i, 3.8 × 3.2 µm; Table X; in three out of five cells). j, k: Lateral views of anterior
body portion of E. micrographica, showing the oral and circumoral ciliature, i.e., the circumoral kinety (for details, see
next plate) and the anteriorly curved somatic kineties, a spathidid character. Compared to E. jamaicensis (g–i), the
macronuclear nodules are larger and rarer. BU – oral bulge, CK – circumoral kinety, MA – macronuclear nodules, OB

body length in protargol preparations (118.8 µm vs. 107.2 µm; Table 1). Basically, these differences
suggest subspecies rank but the considerable difference in the length of the cyst spines as well as in
the number and size of macronuclear nodules suggest species rank.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Remarks: The third species, Enchelariophrya wolfi Foissner, 2016, is type of the genus and occurs
at the same locality as E. jamaicensis. This species is much smaller than E. micrographica and E.
jamaicensis (64.3 × 14.2 µm vs. 118.8 × 40.4 µm in protargol preparations), has only 23.0 vs. 41.4
ciliary rows, and 45 vs. 260 macronuclear nodules and occurs not only in Jamaica but also in the
Morrocoy National Park in Venezuela (Foissner 2016).
Enchelys polynucleata (Foissner, 1984) Foissner, Agatha & Berger, 2002
(Table 2 on p. 309)
Improved diagnosis (averages are provided): Size in vivo about 130 × 65 µm; bursiform. More than
100 macronuclear nodules. Oral bulge extrusomes rod-shaped, indistinctly curved, 10 µm long. On
average 35 ciliary rows, three anteriorly differentiated to a dorsal brush. Oral bulge about 30 µm
long in vivo, ordinary or formed like a propeller blade; temporary cytostome near centre of oral
bulge or neighboured dorsal margin. Resting cyst globular and with distinct spines 5–15 µm long.
Remarks: Over the years, I studied five Enchelys polynucleata-like populations. Originally, I
classified most as E. polynucleata, including two new Australian species, viz., → Enchelys australiensis
and → Crassienchelys oriclavata. Jang et al. (2017) discovered a further species, viz., → Enchelys
megaspinata, briefly described below. Very likely, all belong to the E. polynucleata-complex, possibly
except of Crassienchelys, which is thus not contained in the diagnosis of the complex.

38–77 µm, on average 120 × 55 µm. Oral bulge ordinary, temporary cytostome in or near centre of
oral bulge (0–7 µm, average 1–3 µm out of bulge centre). Spines of resting cyst <10 µm long; cyst
wall colourless.

Remarks: The records from Namibia and Venezuela remain uncertain because the location
of the temporary cytostome was not investigated and protargol preparations were not available.
Possibly, the population from Gough Island is also a distinct subspecies; however, the extremes
overlap suggesting conspecificity with Enchelys polynucleata polynucleata.

flattening posteriorly (k–q); the brush ridges undulate in the dikinetal portion (l, m, n, p); of 10 specimens investigated,
all have few to many, frequently loosely spaced ordinary monokinetal cilia posterior of brush rows 1 and 2 (k, m, n, q,
arrow); brush row 3 has slightly elongated bristles posterior the level of rows 1 and 2 (n, q); the anterior bristle of the
dikinetids is slightly shorter than the posterior (l, o, arrowhead, q); bristle length decreases from anterior to posterior
in rows 1 and 2 (l–o); anterior of the brush rows are some monokinetal, ordinary cilia (Fig. 3a, g). B – dorsal brush,

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Remarks: Foissner & Al-Rasheid (2007, p. 211) already suggested that this population could
be a distinct subspecies of Enchelys polynucleata because the temporary cytostome is rather near
to the dorsal end of the oral bulge (see diagnosis above). All other morphostatic features match E.
polynucleata polynucleata.

Enchelys megaspinata Jang, Vd’ačný, Shazib & Shin, 2017
Diagnosis (adapted to this review): Size in protargol preparations 90–150 × 31–74 µm, on average
130 × 47 µm; body slenderly bursiform. 85–148 macronuclear nodules. On average 30 ciliary rows.
Oral bulge ordinary, 23 µm long on average; temporary cytostome in or near bulge centre. Resting
cyst wall with 8–13 µm long spines.
Type locality: Leaf litter and soil from the surroundings of the Junggol reservoir, Mugeo-dong,
Namgu, Uslan, Korea, 35°32'35''N, 129°15'04''E.
Type material: The holotype slide (NIBRPR0000107176) and one paratype slide (NIBR P-
R 0000107176) with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Natural Institute
of Biological Resources, Incheon, South Korea. One additional paratype slide has been deposited
in the Laboratory of Biodiversity, Department of Biological Science, College of Natural Sciences,
University of Ulsan, South Korea. Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip (Jang et al. 2017, p. 942).
Description and remarks: Enchelys megaspinata has been well described and documented by
Jang et al. (2017). Thus, I refer the reader to their paper for details.
Enchelys megaspinata clearly belongs to the Enchelys polynucleata-complex and is morphologically
most near to → E. polynucleata polynucleata because the temporary cytostome is in or near the
centre of the oral bulge (Fig. 1f–h, 2b, g in Jang et al. 2017). Some other features of E. megaspinata
are slightly different from those of E. polynucleata: body length:width ratio 2.9:1 vs. 1.9:1, thus
slenderly bursiform vs. bursiform; number of macronuclear nodules (85–148, on average 108 vs.
>200); number of ciliary rows (24–33, on average 29.7 vs. 30–45, on average 35), and length of cyst
spines (8–13 µm vs. 5–9 µm).
Enchelys australiensis nov. spec.
(Fig. 8a–l, 9a–s; Tables 2, 3 on p. 309, 310)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 150 × 40 µm; bursiform and 2:1 flattened. About 150–300 ellipsoid
to elongate-ellipsoid macronuclear nodules. Extrusomes rod-shaped and slightly curved, 10 µm
long. Ciliary pattern as typical for genus, on average 42 ciliary rows, three modified anteriorly to
a dorsal brush, middle row about 32 µm long, row 3 distinctly shortened. Oral bulge width about
35 µm, in frontal view curved like a propeller blade; temporary cytostome about 9 µm out of bulge
centre, i.e., neighboured dorsal side.
Type locality: Upper soil layer (0–5 cm) of a small swamp near the village of Eubenangee, south
of the town of Cairns, Australia, 17°05'S, 145°00'E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype and three paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides,
see Fig. 4a–f in Chapter 5.
Etymology: australiensis refers to the continent the species was discovered.
Description: Only 13 specimens were found in eight protargol slides; fortunately, most
specimens were excellently impregnated; however, most cells appear inflated (CV of body width
37.6%). Thus, the morphometry is incomplete.
Body length in vivo 120–190 µm, on average about 150 × 40 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data (Table 2) adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body shape
basically bursiform but rather variable, i.e., ordinarily to broadly bursiform, more or less curved and
flattened laterally, neck indistinct, anterior quarter hyaline, further on studded with food vacuoles

(Fig. 8b, g, h, j, 9a–f, n, p; Table 2). Macronuclear nodules scattered, in some specimens ellipsoid
to broadly ellipsoid, in others ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid or with some long strands; nucleoli of
ordinary size and number (Fig. 8b, k, 9a–c, l, o, p–s; Table 2). A single contractile vacuole in rear
body end. Oral bulge extrusomes (toxicysts) rod-shaped, slightly curved, 10.0–11.0 × 0.5 µm in
size; developing extrusomes as usual, viz., scattered in cytoplasm and with a deeply impregnating
granule in mid of length (Fig. 8b–d, k, 9a–c, p, r). Cytoplasm turbid due to countless granules
about 0.5 µm in size, contains some crystals 3–5 µm in size, resting cyst spines 7–9 µm long, some
lipid droplets 3–10 µm across, and food vacuoles 10–20 µm in size (Fig. 8b, e, f, 9a–f). Feeds on
cysts of flagellates and on moderately-sized ciliates, such as Frontonia depressa, Gonostomum affine,
and Colpoda lucida (Fig. 8i, 9d–k). Glides slowly on microscope slides and between soil particles.

Ciliature as typical for genus, i.e., circumoral kinety absent, oral basket rods thus made by two
to seven oralized somatic monokinetids at beginning of ciliary rows anteriorly curved dorsally
on right side while ventrally on left side (Fig. 8b, j–l, 9o, q–s). Anteriorly, the rows commence
unequally due to the special shape of the oral bulge (see next paragraph). Cilia in vivo 10 µm long,
arranged in an average of 42 ordinarily spaced rows with ordinarily spaced cilia (basal bodies),
except in anterior portion where they are very narrowly spaced. Three dorsal ciliary rows anteriorly
modified to a dikinetal brush with 3 µm long slightly inflated bristles, each row commences with
some monokinetids; brush isomorphic and distinctly heterostichad, kinetids narrowly spaced; rows
1 and 2 about 32 µm long, row 3 distinctly shortened but with a monokinetal bristle tail extending
to near rear body end (Fig. 8a, b, k, l, 9q–s; Table 2).
Oral bulge conspicuous because 6–9 µm high in vivo; screwed like a propeller blade in frontal
view while like a recumbent number 8 in lateral view (Fig. 8d); and the distinct, funnel-shaped,
decentral temporary cytostome neighbouring dorsal side and widely open when feeding on ciliate
prey (Fig. 8b, d, j–k, 9a, f–j, l–o; Table 3); shape of oral bulge mainly in vivo and, less distinctly,

bulge). Oral basket rods comparatively short, viz., 30–60 µm, originate from 2–7 oralized somatic
monokinetids (Fig. 8j, l, 9o–s).
Occurrence and ecology: I found Enchelys australiensis in Australian samples (107, swamp soil)
and (169, bark from trees in the botanical garden in the town of Sydney). These are very different
habitats, indicating a broad niche.
Remarks: Enchelys australiensis is highly similar to several middle and large-sized spathidiids
mainly due to the specific oral bulge so far known only from a few spathidiids (for reviews, see

with such an oral bulge. Recognizing the absence of a circumoral kinety needs protargol preparation.

Enchelys bivacuolata nov. spec.
(Fig. 10a–v, 11a–s; Table 4 on p. 310)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 220 × 40 µm; body very elongate ovate or elongate bursiform with
oblique anterior end occupied by oral bulge. About 260 scattered, ellipsoid macronuclear nodules
and about 11 globular micronuclei. Two contractile vacuoles, one at begin of second third of cell,
another in posterior body end. Extrusomes form a bundle in centre of oral bulge, thorn-shaped and
slightly curved, about 9 µm long in vivo. On average 26 longitudinal ciliary rows, three anteriorly
modified to a monomorphic dorsal brush with up to 5 µm long, slightly inflated bristles. Oral bulge
broadly ellipsoid, indistinct because only 1.5–3.0 µm high.
Type locality: Australian site 111, i.e., soil from woodland in the surroundings of the town of
Alice Springs, 24°S, 134°E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype and five paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). The holotype and paratype specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 5a–i in Chapter 5.

one of the most important features, the number of ciliary rows, has an ordinary variability (CV =
6.3%, Table 4).
Size in vivo 160–275 × 30–50 µm, on average 220 × 40 µm, as calculated from some live
measurements and protargol-impregnated cells adding 15% preparation shrinkage (Table 4). Body
very elongate ovate or elongate bursiform, rarely cylindroid (length: width ratio 5.5:1), usually
slightly curved, anterior end obliquely truncate (Fig. 10a, c–e, j, n, 11g, h, k–m; Table 4). Nuclear
apparatus scattered throughout cell, composed of an average of 250 macronuclear nodules 4–7 ×
2–3 µm in size, studded with minute and moderately-sized nucleoli; shape and size highly variable.
About 10 globular micronuclei difficult to separate from cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 10a, d, i, 11g,
h, j–r; Table 4). Two contractile vacuoles, each with several pores; anterior vacuole posterior to
dorsal brush between first and second third of cell to near mid-body; second vacuole invariably
in posterior end of cell (Fig. 10a, j, n, 11h, i, l, m). Extrusomes restricted to centre of oral bulge,
forming a rather conspicuous bundle, in some specimens faintly impregnated in posterior third;
in type population thorn-shaped, slightly curved, and about 9 µm long (Fig. 10a, b, 11f); in other
populations 8–10 × 0.5–1 µm in size (Fig. 10o–v, 11a, e, f). When exploded with typical toxicyst
structure (Fig. 10q, 11b, e); developing toxicysts common in cytoplasm, fusiform (Fig. 11o, p, r).
Cortex very flexible and rather fragile, most cells thus more or less inflated in protargol preparations.
About 10 rows of colourless cortical granules between two ciliary rows, 0.7–1.0 µm in size, do not
impregnate with the protargol method used (Fig. 10k, 11c). Cytoplasm usually studded with lipid
droplets 3–8 µm across, some 20 µm-sized food vacuoles, macronuclear nodules and developing
toxicysts (Fig. 10a, d, 11g, k, m–o); some cells with spiny resting cyst precursors 5–8 µm long (Fig.
11e, d, j). Creeps and swims rather slowly changing body shape from cylindroid to distinctly curved.
Cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, narrowly to ordinarily spaced, form 23–28, on average 25.5
longitudinal, narrowly spaced rows anteriorly curved dorsally on right side while ventrally on left,

some shortened or broken (Fig. 10a, c, e–g, 11m, n, r; Table 4); produce a “false” circumoral kinety
due to the very narrowly spaced cilia at begin of rows (Fig. 10m, 11q, r). Three rows anteriorly
modified to a monomorphic, heterostichad, dikinetal dorsal brush, each row commences with
1–3 monokinetids; row 1 longest, i.e., 38 µm on average, row 2 slightly shorter than row 1, row
3 shortened posteriorly by about 30% but extending to near posterior body end with 3 µm long,
monokinetal bristles; dikinetids ordinarily spaced, have about 3 µm long, slightly inflated bristles,
not studied in detail (Fig. 10a, e, j, n, 11g, m, n; Table 4).
Oral bulge indistinctly separate from body proper, broadly ellipsoid, centre brownish and
occupied by a bundle of toxicysts described above. Oral basket made by 1–5 oralized somatic
kinetids at anterior end of ciliary rows, basket rods 10–30 µm long; circumoral kinety absent (Fig.

vacuoles. This indicates an insular distribution because it was absent in over 1000 samples studied
by me. Never abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures; pure cultures failed. Food not
identifiable in the vacuoles of impregnated specimens. Very likely, Enchelys bivacuolata lives in the
litter layer, as indicated by the long and slender body.
Remarks: Enchelys bivacuolata is easily identified because all described congeners have only one
contractile vacuole in posterior body end, except of the polyvacuolate → E. polyvacuolata (Berger et
al. 1984; Dragesco & Dragesco-Kernéis 1979; Foissner 1984, 2010; Foissner & Al-Rasheid 2007;
Foissner et al. 2002; Jang et al. 2017; Kahl 1930; Mermod 1914; Vuxanovici 1963). The genus
Enchelys is very distinct because it lacks a circumoral kinety. However, this must be verified by silver
impregnation. The extrusome shape is highly variable (Fig. 10o–v) possibly indicating subspecies
rank or a high natural variability. The same has been described in Pseudoholophrya terricola (Foissner
et al. 2002).
Enchelys polyvacuolata nov. spec.
(Fig. 12a–f, h, j, k, 13a–m; Table 4 on p. 310)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 270 × 40 µm; body slender to vermiform, with oblique anterior end
occupied by oral bulge. About 500 ellipsoid macronuclear nodules. At least five contractile vacuoles
posterior to dorsal brush. Extrusomes form a bundle in centre of oral bulge, very elongate fusiform,
slightly curved and 8–10 µm long. On average 21 ciliary rows extending longitudinally, three
anteriorly modified to a monomorphic, heterostichad, dikinetal dorsal brush. Oral bulge broadly
ellipsoid, moderately distinct.

in Linz (LI). The holotype and some paratype specimens have been marked by black ink circles on
the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 6a–f in Chapter 5.
Etymology: polyvacuolata (with more than two contractile vacuoles) refers to the increased
number of contractile vacuoles.
Description: The species was rare. Thus, the morphometry is slightly incomplete. Most features
are highly variable (CV>15%), very likely due to fixation problems because one of the most
important features, the number of ciliary rows, has an ordinary variability (CV = 7.1%).
Size in vivo 225–320 × 30–60 µm, on average 270 × 40 µm, as calculated from some live

not impregnate with the protargol method used. Cytoplasm colourless, usually studded with lipid
droplets up to 5 µm across and 10 µm-sized food vacuoles containing only a single type of prey
organelles, e.g., trichocysts of Frontonia (Fig. 12a, 13a, i, l). Some cells contain horn-shaped resting
cyst precursors 8–12 µm long (Fig. 12a, d, k, 13a, i, l), and one specimen has a ramified inclusion,
possibly a parasitic fungus (Fig. 13m). Feeds mainly on middle-sized ciliates, such as Frontonia
depressa and Colpoda lucida (Fig. 12a, 13d). Glides and swims rather slowly.
19–23, on average 21 ordinarily spaced ciliary rows with cilia densely spaced in oral region; anteriorly
curved dorsally on right side while ventrally on left; some shortened or broken (Fig. 12a, d, j, k, 13c,
h, i; Table 4). Three rows anteriorly modified to a monomorphic, heterostichad, dikinetal dorsal brush
each commencing with some monokinetids (Fig. 12a, f, k, 13i; Table 4): row 1 slightly shorter than
row 2, row 3 shortened posteriorly by about 42% but extending beyond mid-body with 3 µm long
monokinetal bristles; dikinetids ordinarily spaced, have 2–3 µm long bristles, not studied in detail.
Oral bulge rather distinctly separate from body proper because slightly wider than neck and up
to 4 µm high, elliptic in frontal view, centre occupied by a bundle of toxicysts described above. Oral
basket made by some oralized somatic kinetids at anterior end of ciliary rows, basket rods up to 40
µm long; circumoral kinety absent (Fig. 12a, c, d, h, j, k, 13a, c, e, f, h, i; Table 4).
Occurrence and ecology: The type locality is covered with grass and Opuntia. The soil is slightly
red brown and has pH 4.8 in water. The sample was collected on 21.7.1985 by Dr. Wolfgang Petz
(Salzburg, Austria). The same or a rather similar species occurs at Australian sites 111 (soil from
woodland in the surroundings of the town of Alice Springs) and 159 (soil from floodplain of the
Murray River; about 300 µm in vivo, extrusomes thorn-shaped) as well as in the Pantanal (Brazil).
Thus, Enchelys polyvacuolata or a very similar species has a wide ecological range and cosmopolitan
distribution.
Remarks: Enchelys polyvacuolata is a conspicuous species with several contractile vacuoles while
all described congeners have only one or two (Berger et al. 1984; Dragesco & Dragesco-Kernéis
1979; Foissner 1984, 1987c, 2010; Foissner et al. 2002; Kahl 1930; → E. bivacuolata) except of E.
multivacuolata Vuxanovici, 1963 which, however, is only 70 µm long and broadly elliptic (Fig. 12i).
Another species, E. vermiformis Foissner, 1987c has a similar size and shape as E. polyvacuolata but
has rows of somatic extrusomes and a moniliform macronucleus (Fig. 12g).
Crassienchelys nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Medium-sized Enchelyidae Ehrenberg, 1838 with cuneate oral bulge and a comparatively
large temporary cytostome near dorsal margin of oral bulge. Left side ciliary rows distinctly curved
and condensed anteriorly while moderately curved and condensed on right side. Dorsal brush three-
or four-rowed, i.e., composed of one or two short rows and two long rows. Resting cyst wall spinous.
Type species: → Crassienchelys oriclavata nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective crassus (thick), the thematic vowel ·i­, and the
genus-group name Enchelys (eel), meaning a “thick Enchelys”. Feminine gender.
Species assignable: → Crassienchelys oriclavata nov. spec.
Remarks: At first glance, Crassienchelys looks like Cranotheridium Schewiakoff, 1892, a rather
superficially described genus from Australia (Schewiakoff 1892, 1893, 1896). It has a single main
characteristic, viz., a specific structure in anterior dorsal margin of cell and resembling the basket
found in nassulids (Fig. 14a). However, Kahl (1930) interpreted the “basket” as a bundle of
trichocysts. I agree.
In 1984, Wirnsberger, Foissner & Adam used protargol for redescribing Pseudoprorodon foliosus
Foissner, 1983a and suggested a spathidid relationship because it has a circumoral kinety and a

rows (Fig. 14b–d). The classification into Cranotheridium of the ciliate studied by Wirnsberger et al.
(1984) can be accepted when the basket of the ciliate studied by Schewiakoff (1892) is interpreted
as a bundle of extrusomes.
Another similar ciliate is Prorodon deflandrei discovered by Dragesco (1960) in the fine coastal
sands of Lake Geneva. It matches Crassienchelys roughly by body shape and the clavate oral bulge
while the ciliary rows are not curved anteriorly; in addition, it possesses symbiotic green algae
(zoochlorelles). Further investigations on the shape of the ciliary rows are required.

10 µm in size, on average 12 µm distant from dorsal bulge margin. Cyst scales conical.
Type locality: Australian site (96), i.e., near to the town of Darwin, entrance to the Foog Dam
(12°33'29''S, 131°17'50''E); litter and soil from a young Eucalyptus forest.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype and six paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). The holotype and paratype specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 7a–m in Chapter 5.
Etymology: oriclavata is a composite in genitive case of os – oris (mouth) and the participial
adjective clavatus ­a ­um, meaning a ciliate with clavate mouth.
Description: Few specimens were present, when I cleared the non-flooded Petri dish culture
most cells had produced cyst scales; re-watering did not revive the population. The high coefficients
of variability (most >15%) suggest that Crassienchelys oriclavata is rather variable (Table 5), very
likely also due to insufficient fixation. Thus, measurements must be interpreted with care (Table 5).
Size in vivo 100–190 × 55–110 µm, on average about 140 × 60 µm, as calculated from some live
measurements and protargol-impregnated cells adding 15% preparation shrinkage (Table 5). Body

of inclusions: (i) many macronuclear nodules as described above; (ii) many developing and some
mature cyst scales (lepidosomes), developing scales 3–5 µm across, one half filled with smooth,
refractive material, the other half hyaline looking empty (Fig. 14e–g); mature scales about 10 µm
high, conical with circular base plate, both showing minute ridges bifurcated distally (Fig. 14f,
15c–e); such scales have been observed mainly in haptorids and enchelydids (see this monograph
and Foissner 2016); (iii) many globular and some tear-shaped structures 3–10 µm, respectively
up to 20 µm in size; impregnate faintly to deeply, many contain deeply impregnated granules and
granular accumulations resembling nuclear material, and a few look like dividers producing dumb-
bell-shaped figures (Fig. 14g, l, 15a–k, m–o, q, s, t, x).
Originally, I classified these granular globules as coccidian parasites; however, now I interpret
them as minute food vacuoles containing selected prey. This is supported by the absence of classical
food vacuoles larger than 20 µm, indicating that prey is lysed outside and then ingested and sorted
according to materials, such as extrusomes, lipid droplets, and nuclear pieces. Swims and creeps
rather fast.
Only one early mid-divider is contained and marked in the protargol slides. While the ciliary
pattern seems to divide ordinarily (Fig. 15u), the ellipsoid macronuclear nodules become long and
fusiform (Fig. 15v), as in some dileptids (for a review, see Vd’ačný & Foissner 2012).
Ciliary pattern epispathidid but without circumoral kinety, left side ciliary rows anteriorly
distinctly curved and condensed, right side rows only condensed anteriorly and gradually abutting
on oral bulge (Fig. 14g, m, p, 15h, k, m–p, s, t). Cilia of oral area about 14 µm long, decrease to 11
µm near posterior end of cell, all ciliary and dorsal brush rows begin with 3–6 very narrowly spaced
oralized somatic monokinetids, producing the oral basket rods (Fig. 14g, o, 15s). On average 62
narrowly to very narrowly spaced, densely ciliated rows abutting on oral bulge, four, rarely only
three rows anteriorly modified to an isomorphic, distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush composed of
ordinarily to narrowly spaced dikinetids having about 3 µm long bristles in vivo, monokinetal tail
of leftmost row with fusiform bristles gradually shortened to 2 µm in posterior third (Fig. 14g, p–r,
15g, k, q, r, w; Table 5).
Oral bulge moderately convex, cord of curve about 45 µm long in protargol preparations, slightly
to distinctly oblique, clavate and about 13 µm wide near dorsal end, about 2 µm high at ventral
end while about 6 µm at dorsal end, slightly screwed like a propeller blade in frontal view while
like a recumbent number 8 in lateral view (Fig. 14g, e, h, 15m, n, p–t; Table 5; cp. → Enchelys
australiensis). Temporary cytostome on average 14 µm distant from dorsal margin of oral bulge,
obconical with wide end on surface of bulge, about 10 × 8 µm in size and more conspicuous in vivo
than in protargol preparations (Fig. 14g, h, n, p–r, 15g, h, k, p; Table 5).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality and very likely also in the Brazilian
Pantanal where very few specimens occurred; the only difference in life observation was the length
of the extrusomes (11 µm vs. 13–15 µm). Crassienchelys oriclavata is a massive, conspicuous species
possibly endemic to Gondwana.
Remarks: Crassienchelys oriclavata is easily recognized by the comparably large temporary
cytostome, the many macronuclear nodules, and the moderate body length (~100–150 µm). There
is no other haptorid with such a combination of features. See also “Remarks” to genus.
Nomenclatural corrections and new spathidid genera
Foissner (2016) created the spathidid genus Facetospatha (species with arcuospathidid ciliary pattern
and faceted cyst wall) with Arcuospathidium cultriforme (Penard, 1922) Foissner, 1984 as type
species. However, Helmut Berger (Salzburg) recognized that I used Spathidium cultriforme Penard,
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 55–345 / 98

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
1922 previously as type species for the genus Arcuospathidium Foissner, 1984. Thus, Facetospatha
Foissner, 2016 has to be suppressed and the character “faceted cyst wall” added to the diagnosis of
Arcuospathidium. A new genus is required for arcuospathidids that have another cyst wall (see below).
As yet, the resting cyst of most spathidid genera and species is not known because it never has
been used as a generic character though it is of paramount significance for dispersal and survival
(Foissner 2011). Based on this knowledge, I created three spathidid genera in 2016: Mamillospatha,
Columnospatha and Facetospatha (Foissner 2016). Here, I add three new genera diagnosed below
and provide an improved diagnosis for Arcuospathidium.
Levispatha nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Spathidiidae Kahl in Doflein & Reichenow, 1929 with arcuospathidid ciliary pattern
and smooth cyst wall.
Type species: Levispatha tristicha (Foissner et al., 2002) nov. stat., nov. comb. (original
combination: Arcuospathidium namibiense tristicha Foissner, Agatha & Berger, 2002).
Species assignable: Levispatha tristicha (type species); Levispatha muscorum (Dragesco &
Dragesco-Kernéis, 1979) nov. comb. (original combination: Spathidium muscorum Dragesco &
Dragesco-Kernéis, 1979); → Levispatha australiensis nov. sp.
Etymology: Levispatha is a composite of the Latin adjective levis (smooth) and the Latinized
Greek noun spatha (spathula; Hentschel & Wagner 1996), referring to the smooth cyst wall.
Feminine gender.
Remarks: There are now three arcuospathidid genera: Arcuospathidium (with faceted cyst wall;
junior objective synonym Facetospatha Foissner, 2016); Columnospatha (cyst wall with pillar-shaped
lepidosomes), and Levispatha (cyst wall smooth).
Arcuospathidium Foissner, 1984
1984 Arcuospathidium nov. gen. — Foissner, Stapfia, 12: 74. Type species (by original designation): Spathidium cultri­
forme Penard, 1922.
2007 Arcuospathidium Foissner, 1984 — Foissner & Xu, Monogr. Biol., 81: 156 (detailed revision).
2007 Arcuospathidium Foissner, 1984 — Jankowski, Phylum Ciliophora, p. 565 (generic revision).
2016 Facetospatha nov. gen. — Foissner, Denisia, 35: 187. Type species (by original designation): Spathidium cultriforme
Penard, 1922 (junior objective synonym, that is, illegitimate because based on same type species as Arcuospathid­
ium).
Improved diagnosis: Spathidiidae Kahl in Doflein & Reichenow, 1929 with arcuospathidid ciliary
pattern and thick, faceted cyst wall.
Type species: Arcuospathidium cultriforme (Penard, 1922) Foissner, 1984 (original combination:
Spathidium cultriforme Penard, 1922).
Species assignable: So far only the type species.
Etymology: The name is a composite of the Latin noun arcus (arc, curve) and the genus-group
name Spathidium, referring to the often long and curved oral bulge and the similarity to the genus
Spathidium. Neuter gender (from Foissner & Xu 2007).
Remarks: Foissner & Xu (2007) recognized three subspecies in A. cultriforme but the cyst
structure is known only from Arcuospathidium cultriforme cultriforme.

Foissner Wilhelm
Protospatha nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Spathidiidae Kahl in Doflein & Reichenow, 1929 with protospathidid ciliary pattern
and smooth cyst wall.
Type species: Protospatha terricola (Foissner, 1998) nov. comb. (original combination:
Protospathidium terricola Foissner, 1998).
Species assignable: Protospatha terricola (Foissner, 1998) nov. comb.
Etymology: Protospatha is a composite of the Latin comparative proto (the first) and the Latinized
Greek noun spatha (spathula; Hentschel & Wagner 1996), referring to the supposed plesiomorphic
genus Protospathidium. Feminine gender.
Remarks: The type species of Protospathidium Dragesco & Dragesco-Kernéis, 1979 is P.
muscicola Dragesco & Dragesco-Kernéis, 1979, which has nipple-shaped cyst scales matching the
protospathidid genus Mamillospatha Foissner, 2016.
Spinispatha nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Spathidiidae Kahl in Doflein & Reichenow, 1929 with protospathidid ciliary pattern
and a spiny cyst wall.
Type species: Spinispatha serpens (Kahl, 1930) nov. comb. (original combination: Spathidium
serpens Kahl, 1930).
Species assignable: Spinispatha serpens (Kahl, 1930) nov. comb.
Etymology: Spinispatha is a composite of the Latin adjective spinosus (thorny, spiny) and the
Latinized Greek noun spatha (spathula; Hentschel & Wagner 1996), referring to the spiny cyst wall.
Feminine gender.
Remarks: The Antarctic Protospathidium serpens (Kahl, 1930) Foissner, 1981 has a different
cyst and is thus very likely another species, viz., P. fraterculus Xu & Foissner, 2005 (for details, see
Foissner & Xu 2007, p. 130).
Levispatha australiensis nov. spec.
(Fig. 16a–l, 17a–x, 18a–k, 19; Table 6 on p. 312)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 100 × 20 µm. Narrowly spatulate with oblique to strongly oblique,
very narrowly cuneate oral bulge about 2 µm wide and high and 1.2 times longer than widest trunk
region. Macronucleus usually oblong; single micronucleus. Extrusomes slightly curved rods with a
size of about 8.0 × 0.3 µm, attached only to right half of oral bulge and absent from dorsal bulge
region. On average 13 ciliary rows, three anteriorly differentiated to a heterostichad dorsal brush
occupying 15% of body length. Brush bristles up to 3 µm long; rows 1 and 2 each composed of an
average of 12 dikinetids, row 3 of seven followed by a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to second
quarter of cell.
Type locality: Soil from floodplain of the Murray River near to the town of Albury (Australia),
waterside of Ryans Road.1
Type material: The slide containing the holotype and three paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
1 Note by H. Berger: Foissner did not provide geographic co-ordinates. According to Google Maps, the sample site
must be at or near the following point: 36°06'49.342''S, 146°58'13.966''E. This is very likely also the type locality of →

Fig. 18g–k. Levispatha australiensis, resting cysts from life (g–i) and after methyl green-pyronin staining (j, k).
g–i: The cyst, which has an average diameter of 35 µm has a thin, smooth wall. Usually, there is a heap of slime and
granules (i), which highly resemble those in the cytoplasm, attached to the wall (arrows). j: Many of the cysts are
from post-conjugants because they have two globular macronuclear nodules. k: The cyst wall is about 1 µm thick

at low magnification; (iii) in trophonts many lipid droplets some impregnating with protargol (Fig.
18b). Feeds on hetertrophic euglenids, viz., Peranema sp. and Cyclidiopsis sp. Movement without
peculiarities.
Cilia about 8 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations, on average 31 cilia in a lateral row;
arranged in an average of 13 equidistantly and ordinarily spaced rows in typical Arcuospathidium
pattern, i. e., do not touch the circumoral kinety and their length increases gradually from ventral
to dorsal end of oral bulge (Fig. 16a, b, e, f, 17i, s, u, v, 18c; Table 6). Dorsal brush three-rowed,
occupies only 15% of body length, heterostichad because row 3 shorter than rows 1 and 2 by an
average of 32%, isomorphic, dikinetids ordinarily spaced (1.1–1.3 µm); rows 1 and 2 of same length
each composed of an average of 12 dikinetids, row 3 composed of about seven dikinetids, continues
to second quarter of body with an average of eight monokinetidal bristles (Fig. 16a, f, 17j, u, v, 18b,
d–f; Table 6). Brush bristles oblong, distal end knob-like inflated when disturbed. Anterior bristles
of row 1 dikinetids about 2 µm long, posterior bristles of same length as anterior bristles in upper
half of row gradually decreasing to about 1 µm in posterior half. Bristles of rows 2 and 3 very similar,
i. e., anterior bristles of dikinetids 2.5–3.0 µm long in upper half of rows gradually decreasing to
about 1 µm in posterior half; posterior bristles of dikinetids about 1 µm long in anterior half of
rows gradually decreasing to about 0.5 µm in posterior half (Fig. 16a, f, i, 17j, 18e, f). Anterior tail
of brush row 1 composed of one or two ordinary cilia; tail of row 2 composed of an average of two
cilia; tail of row 3 composed of 1–3 cilia (Fig. 16a, f, 17u, v, 18d, e; Table 6).

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
a usual basket rarely impregnating with protargol. Rarely, specimens with two mouths, one after the
other, the anterior more or less disturbed.
Resting cyst: Levispatha australiensis makes type III cysts (Foissner & Xu 2007), usually with
a heap of extruded slime and bright cytoplasmic granules 0.5–2.0 µm across; rarely, the granules
are distributed around the cyst (Fig. 16h, 18g–k). Mature cysts spherical, on average 35 µm across,
colourless; wall about 1 µm thick and composed of two membranous layers staining red with
methylgreen-pyronin; without slime cover. Macronucleus oblong or, in encysted postconjugants, in
two globular nodules (Fig. 16h, 18g–k; Table 6).
Division: The protargol slides contain several dividers. Here, only a very early stage with greatly
inflated micronucleus is shown (Fig. 16l), just as described in Cultellothrix coemeterii (Kahl, 1943)
(for revision, see Foissner & Xu 2007, p. 275).
Conjugation: The protargol slides contain some conjugating specimens and many post-dividers
with two globular macronuclear nodules. All were excluded from the morphometric analysis. The
cells unite with the oral bulge in the ventral-to-dorsal mode (Foissner & Xu 2007).
Phylogeny: The small subunit rDNA gene shows that Arcuospathidium is polyphyletic, appearing
in several clades of the haptorian phylogenetic tree (Vďačný et al. 2014; Fig. 19). Levispatha
australiensis forms a distinct clade and is sister to a rather large clade containing Arcuospathidium
cultriforme and A. namibiense Foissner et al., 2002. However, this may change because the statistical
support is low.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i. e., in a non-flooded Petri dish
culture with litter and soil from the floodplain of the Murray River. Thus, Levispatha australiensis
might be a limnetic species. It grew well for two months so that it could be studied in detail.
Remarks: There are several spathidids which resemble Levispatha australiensis but none has the
same combination of characters (for a review, see Foissner & Xu 2007). For instance, Arcuospathidium
cooperi Foissner, 1996b, which has a similar shape, size, and cytoplasmic inclusions lacks extrusomes
(for a review, see Foissner & Xu 2007, p. 157). Armatospathula periarmata Foissner & Xu, 2007 has
a similar size and shape but has somatic extrusomes (Foissner & Xu 2007, p. 308). Edaphospathula
gracilis Foissner & Xu, 2007 is also slender but possesses lenticular extrusomes and a different
circumoral ciliary pattern (Foissner & Xu 2007, p. 88).
Levispatha australiensis resembles Cultellothrix coemeterii in that the micronucleus becomes
enormously inflated during early division (Fig. 16l). Indeed, C. coemeterii is sister to L. australiensis
in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 19). A further peculiarity is the ornamentation of the oral bulge.
Usually, this is an arrowhead-like pattern with thin arms (Foissner & Xu 2007) while L. australiensis
and Arcuospathidium cooperi have thick arms.

Remarks: Possibly, this is a weak genus, differing from Fuscheria by the presence of polymerizations
in some right lateral ciliary rows (Fig. 20b, 21c, s). The polymerizations are ciliated but their genesis
and function is not known. However, there is some relation to the lifestyle: Fuscheria species prefer
limnetic habitats while Pseudofuscheria species prefer terrestrial habitats.

Fig. 21l–o. Pseudofuscheria magna after protargol impregnation. l, m: At the anterior body end, the oral basket has
a diameter of about 40 µm because not only the circumoral dikinetids (arrowhead) produce basket rods but also the
monokinetids in the anterior region of the ciliary rows (oralized somatic monokinetids). n: Dorsal view of anterior
body region, showing the isostichad dorsal brush and developing extrusomes some of which are deeply impregnated at
both ends (arrowhead). o: Dorsolateral view, showing the dorsal brush and two kineties with a spot of very narrowly

Etymology: The species-group name magna (Latin adjective) refers to the comparatively large
body size.
Description: This species is highly variable because most features investigated have a CV>15%
(Table 8). This is common in haptorids because many features are influenced by the nutrition state:

Fig. 21p–s. Pseudofuscheria magna after protargol impregnation. p, q: Same specimen at two focal planes to show
details of the two dorsal brush rows. The posterior bristles of the dikinetids of row 1 are 4–6 µm long, the anterior
bristles are 3–4 µm. Long postciliary microtubular ribbons originate from the anterior kinetids of the dorsal brush
and the anterior monokinetids of the somatic kineties and contribute to the oral basket. r, s: Dorsal brush. The space
between the dikinetids is larger in the posterior than the anterior half of the rows. The dikinetids of the circumoral
kinety are deeper impregnated and slightly larger than the monokinetids of the ciliary rows. The arrowheads mark
polymerizations in two right side kineties. B1, 2 – dorsal brush rows 1 and 2, CK – circumoral kinety, E – oral bulge
and developing extrusomes. The mature extrusomes are nail-shaped, the nailhead is recognizable (p), OB – oral basket,

the more food ingested the higher the variability. Fortunately, three important characteristics have –
beside the generic features – a CV<15%, viz., body length (12.7%), shape and size of macronucleus
(small compared to body size and congeners), and the number of ciliary rows (6.8%).
Size in protargol preparations on average 118 × 58 µm (length:width ratio 2.1:1, Table 8) and
136 × 67 µm when 15% preparation shrinkage is added. Body shape slenderly to broadly ellipsoid
(Fig. 20a, b, d, e, 21a, c, f, fa, g, h) or indistinctly ovate (Fig. 20c, 21b, e); unflattened. Macronucleus
usually in anterior body half, rarely in mid-body or in posterior body half, on average 42 × 10
µm in size (Table 8), i.e., short compared to cell size and similar species from other genera; shape
rather stable, usually oblong and slightly curved (71% out of 38 specimens, Fig. 20a–d, 21a–c,
e, fa, j, k), rarely cylindroid (18.4%, Fig. 20e, 21g, h), horseshoe-shaped or semi-circular (10.5%,

Fig. 21f). Micronucleus attached to curved centre of macronucleus, rarely to convex side; discoid,
i.e., about 5.0 µm across and 2.5 µm thick (Fig. 20a–c, 21a, c, fa, k; Table 8). Two micronuclei in
two out of 38 specimens. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, several excretory pores (Fig.
20a, b, 21a). Cortex very flexible, about 1.5 µm thick, contains countless ellipsoid granules and a
conspicuous fibre system produced by the postciliary microtubule ribbons (Fig. 21i). Extrusomes
nail-shaped, about 7 µm long, concentrated in oral basket, anterior and posterior end slightly to
deeply impregnated with protargol (Fig. 20a, 21a, e, p). Developing extrusomes about 7 µm long in
protargol preparations, one end with a 2–3 µm-sized, fluffy, drumstick-shaped structure, very likely
the developing nail head of the mature organelle (Fig. 20a, 21b, d, k, m, o–q; Table 8); rarely, an
earlier(?) stage is recognizable, viz., about 9 µm long rods with both ends deeper impregnated than
the middle third (Fig. 21n). Cytoplasm colourless, usually studded with developing extrusomes and
small to large food vacuoles when sufficient prey is available; when hungry studded with refractive
granules 1–3 µm across (Fig. 20a, 21a, e). Swims slowly, showing pronounced flexibility when
moving in organic masses.
Somatic and oral infraciliature as typical for genus and haptorids in general (Vďačný & Foissner
2012). Cilia about 9 µm long in protargol preparations, arranged in an average of 28 ordinarily to widely
(~5 µm) spaced rows beginning with a circumoral dikinetid and 10–15 oralized somatic monokinetids
having about 40 µm long rods contributing to the oral basket; more densely spaced in perioral area (Fig.
20a, b, 21o, s; Table 8). Dorsal brush isostichad, composed of two short rows of dikinetids continuing
as ordinary ciliary rows to posterior end of cell. Row 1 composed of an average of 28 dikinetids with
anterior bristle approximately 2.8 µm long and posterior about 2.4 µm. Row 2 composed of an average
of 23 dikinetids with anterior bristle about 1.8 µm long and posterior approximately 3.6 µm; has a
monokinetal tail extending to about mid-body with circa 3 µm long bristles. On average five ciliary rows
between dorsal brush row 2 and polymerization 1 comprising about 13 narrowly spaced monokinetids
while polymerization 2 consists of only nine monokinetids (Fig. 20a, b, 21c, o, s; Table 8); polymerization
absent in two out of 38 specimens investigated (Fig. 21fa).
Oral bulge very inconspicuous because only about 10 µm across and 2 µm high but can open
widely because large prey, e.g., the hypotrich Gonostomum sp., is ingested alive (Fig. 20a, b, d, 21a, e,
o, p; Table 8). Circumoral kinety composed of distinct dikinetids from anterior end of each ciliary
row, their number thus equalizing ciliary rows; each dikinetid produces an about 40 µm long rod
contributing to oral basket (Fig. 20c, d, 21c, l, m, p, q; Table 8).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i.e., soil and litter from a floodplain
in Australia. Shape and size indicate that it is a limnetic litter species (Foissner 1987b).
Remarks: Pseudofuscheria magna differs from P. terricola by the large body size, the shape of the
macronucleus, and the much higher number of brush dikinetids and ciliary rows (Table 7).
Among Fuscheria, which has also nail-shaped extrusomes, only Fuscheria nodosa salisburgensis
Foissner & Gabilondo in Gabilondo & Foissner, 2009 has as similar body size and number of ciliary
rows while the number of brush dikinetids and the shape of the macronucleus are distinctly different
(Table 7). The family Pleuroplitidae should be mentioned because Pleuroplitoides smithi Foissner, 1996a
has a great overall similarity to Pseudofuscheria magna, differing in the location of the extrusomes, i.e.,
apical in the oral basket (fuscheriids) vs. far subapical between two ciliary rows (pleuroplitids).

Type locality: Leaf litter, surface soil (0–10 cm),
and some moss from a primeval (undisturbed for
at least 100 years) spruce-fir-beech forest in Styria,
Austria, 47°46'N, 15°07'E.
Type material: Unfortunately, I lost the slide with
the holotype specimen (Fig. 22d, e); possibly, I put it
in the wrong box.1 Thus, I deposited three slides with
protargol-impregnated specimens from the type series
in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). Some well-impregnated specimens have
been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For
slides, see Fig. 10a–c in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Pinetum is the Latin noun for a spruce
forest where the species was discovered.
Description: Most features investigated have
a coefficient of variation >15%, suggesting high
variability of the species. Size in vivo 144 × 50 µm (n = 5) on average; in protargol preparations
116.9 × 39.5 µm (n = 19); when 15% preparation shrinkage is added, in vivo values are obtained
matching well those provided above: 101–196 × 35–61 µm, on average 134 × 45 µm (Table 9).
Body shape rather variable, basically slenderly to broadly lanceolate with length:width ratios of
2.3–4.5:1, on average 3.1:1 (Fig. 22a, c, d, o, p, 23a, b, g–i; Table 9). Ventral margin moderately
to distinctly convex, dorsal margin sigmoid due to a slight to distinct concavity between first and
second third of body. Both sides moderately convex (Fig. 23l, 24a); anterior third and ventral
margin leaf-like flattened and thus hyaline; posterior body region frequently slightly narrowed due
to the thinning oral bulge (Fig. 22a, o, p, 23i, l). Nuclear apparatus in middle third of body (Fig.
22a, d, n, 23f, 24c–f; Table 9). Macronucleus moniliform with an average of 19 nodules producing
a discoid or globular irregular cluster; nodules 11 × 5 µm on average; in some cells composed of
pieces with 2–4 nodules. Nine broadly ellipsoid micronuclei on average, scattered in and around
macronuclear cluster. Contractile vacuole in midline of posterior body end (Fig. 22a, o, 23a, f, j, k).
1 Note by H. Berger: For nominal species-group taxa established after 1999, name-bearing types must be fixed origi-
nally (ICZN 1999, article 72.3). According to article 73.1.4, the designation of an illustration of a single specimen as a
holotype is to be treated as designation of the specimen illustrated; the fact that the specimen no longer exists or cannot
be traced does not of itself invalidate the designation. This indicates that the new species is valid, although the slide
containing the holotype specimen was “lost” (see above). The name on the three slides (which are obviously paratype
slides) from the type series is “Bryophyllum pinetum” (this name is disclaimed for nomenclatural purposes; ICZN 1999,
article 8.3).

Fig. 23o, p. Apobryophyllum pinetum, dorsal brush in the scanning electron microscope; compare with scheme Fig.
22k. The heteromorphic brush is the genus character (cp. with → Bryophyllum australiense) and is very complex because
monokinetal, ordinary cilia (arrowheads) are mixed with dikinetal, minute bristles which are slightly to greatly different
in the individual brush rows and in anterior and posterior region of the brush; posterior of the brush, the rows continue
as ordinary somatic kineties except of the last row which has a monokinetal bristle tail extending to near posterior end
of cell (arrows). B – dorsal brush, CK – circumoral kinety, OE– oral bulge, 1–6 – brush rows. Scale bars 30 µm.
a plate-like structure is produced (Fig. 22i, j, 23j, k). Cytoplasm colourless, posterior left quadrant
of cell usually packed with globular and irregular fat droplets up to 10 µm in size (Fig. 24b). Feeds
very likely on ciliates lysed outside the cell because no prey could be detected inside the cells.
Glides slowly and elegantly on microscope slides and soil particles, showing great flexibility but no
undulating ventral margin; when swimming, rotates around main body axis.

Cilia 8–10 µm long in vivo, arranged in an average of 28 longitudinal rows rather evenly spaced,
those of right side abutting to anterior third of circumoral kinety while extending to posterior end
of cell (Fig. 22d, e, 23i). Anterior third of 6–10, on average eight left lateral ciliary rows modified
to a heterostichid dorsal brush, i.e., with ordinary, monokinetal cilia between dikinetal bristles.
Anterior quarter of brush rows usually composed of only dikinetids. Bristle structure rather different
in the individual rows: bristles of row 1 of same length (~3 µm), of rows 2 and 3 of different length
(anterior much shorter than inflated posterior up to 5 µm long), of rows 4–7 similar to rows 2
and 3 but posterior bristles not inflated and shorter (~3 µm), dikinetids more narrowly spaced in
second or third row (“main brush row”) left of last row similar to first row but composed of only few
dikinetids anteriorly and followed by a monokinetal bristle tail extending to near posterior body

end. Bristles gradually decrease in length from anterior to posterior by about 50% (Fig. 22e, k–m,
23h, i, o, p, r, t, u; Table 9).
Oral apparatus as in congeners, e.g., Apobryophyllum schmidingeri Foissner & Al-Rasheid, 2007.
Thus, I refer to the figures in A. pinetum (Fig. 22a, b, d, l, m–p, 23a, b, f, i, j, l–r, t, 24a, b; Tables 9,
10).
Occurrence and ecology: See Tables 1 and 4 in Foissner et al. (2005) for detailed site data (pH,
organic C, etc.). Some kilometres distant occurs A. schmidingeri Foissner & Al-Rasheid, 2007 in a
commercial spruce forest. Further, I found A. pinetum in forest soil from the surroundings of the
town of Uema, Sweden.
Remarks: Apobryophyllum pinetum can be probably confused with A. schmidingeri and
Bryophyllum lingua multistriatum; see Table 10 for separation. The best character is the moniliform,
globular macronuclear mass (Fig. 22a, d, n, 23f, q, 24c–f). I introduced the term “main brush row”
because the last three brush kineties of Apobryophyllum match the three-rowed dorsal brush of
many other haptorids, especially in the order Spathidiida (for a review, see Foissner & Xu 2007).
Accordingly, the complex brush pattern of Apobryophyllum is very likely derived.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Type material: The slide containing the holotype and one paratype slide with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides,
see Fig. 11a–e in Chapter 5.
Etymology: australiense refers to the continent the species was discovered.
Description: In vivo, I misidentified this species as Neobryophyllum paucistriatum (Foissner et
al., 2002) Foissner & Lei, 2004 when I made the species list in 1985 because both have a great overall
similarity. Thus, detailed live observations were not performed. However, Bryophyllum australiense
is a typical member of the genus and thus it is reasonable to describe the species despite the lack of
detailed live observations.
Except of body length and number of ciliary rows, all features investigated are highly variable,
i.e., have coefficients of variation >15% (Table 11).
Size in protargol preparations 67–122 × 23–44 µm, on average 98 × 29 µm (Table 11). When
15% preparation shrinkage is added, in vivo values are obtained: 77–140 × 23–44 µm, on average
about 115 × 35 µm. Body shape as typical for genus, i.e., slenderly to very slenderly lanceolate
(2.4–5:1), usually 3.5:1, i.e., slenderly lanceolate; anterior end bluntly acute and more or less curved
dorsally, posterior end broadly rounded with a small dorsal indentation where the oral bulge ends;
ventral margin slightly to distinctly convex, dorsal margin straight to slightly convex or concave;
laterally distinctly flattened (Fig. 25a–c, 26a–g, i, j; Table 11). Nuclear apparatus in middle third
of body (Fig. 25a, 26a, d–f; Table 11). Macronucleus about 60 µm long, usually highly tortuous
having about five, usually indistinct nodules; nucleoli numerous and small. Micronucleus often
within tortuous macronuclear strand and thus difficult to recognize, globular to broadly ellipsoid,
on average 3.6 × 2.4 µm in protargol preparations. Contractile vacuole near posterior dorsal margin
of cell, about 8–12 excretory pores on right side of body, i.e. left of rear end of oral bulge (Fig.
26a). Two types of oral bulge and cytoplasmic extrusomes: main type I rod-shaped to indistinctly
fusiform, 5–6 µm long, does not impregnate with the protargol method used but recognizable in
most protargol-impregnated specimens with interference contrast; type II fine, about 2 µm long
rods occasionally deeply impregnating with the protargol method used (Fig. 26d). Cortex very
flexible and colourless.
Cilia about 8 µm long in protargol preparations, arranged in five left side and five right side rows
in typical Bryophyllum pattern (Foissner et al. 2002; Foissner & Lei 2004), intrakinetid distances
about twice as large in anterior than posterior thirds of cell; three dorsal rows anteriorly modified to
a dorsal brush with 2–3 µm long bristles, middle row, on average, slightly longer than right and left
row, each row commences with 1–6 monokinetids; two or three right side rows slightly shortened
due to the pores of the contractile vacuole (Fig. 25a–c, 26a–g, j; Table 1).
Oral apparatus as described by Foissner et al. (2002) for Bryophyllum paucistriatum (now
Neobryophyllum paucistriatum) (Fig. 25a–c, 26a–g; Table 11).
Occurrence and ecology: This was a species-rich sample (for details, see type locality.1
Bryophyllum australiense appeared 4 d after rewetting the sample and developed moderate
abundances the following three weeks.
Remarks: None of the bryophyllids listed in the study of Foissner & Lei (2004) is identical
with Bryophyllum australiense. However, at first glance the Australian species highly resembles B.
paucistriatum Foissner et al., 2002, which has been transferred to Neobryophyllum by Foissner &
Lei (2004) because it has four or five (vs. usually three) isomorphic brush rows (cp. Fig. 25c with

details, see type locality) with XX species of which XX were undescribed.” (XX = number of species not yet mentioned

Gelei, 1936 (Fig. 25e). It is a Sphagnum species much more slender than B. australiense (average
length:width ratio 5.8:1 vs. 3.5:1). All other characteristics are highly similar though slight
differences occur in the number of macronuclear nodules (four vs. five) and ciliary rows (12 vs. 10).
Unfortunately, Gelei (1936) did not report on the extrusomes.

Diagnosis: See diagnosis of Rimaleptus similis australiensis nov. ssp. for differences.
Remarks: The Australian subspecies (see below) is clearly different from the Costa Rican and
the Kenyan populations representing the nominotypical subspecies of Rimaleptus similis (Foissner,
1995) Vd’ačný & Foissner, 2012. However, there is only one “strong” character, viz., the number of
somatic ciliary rows, suggesting subspecies classification (Table 12 on p. 317).
Rimaleptus similis australiensis nov. ssp.
(Fig. 27a–e, 28a–r; Table 12 on p. 317)
Diagnosis: As nominal subspecies but with a body size of 255 × 35 µm (vs. about 219 × 57 µm
in Costa Rican population and 245 × 43 µm in Kenyan population) in protargol preparations, a
length:width ratio of 7.3:1 (vs. 4.0:1 and 5.7:1), and with an average of 19 (vs. 29 and 31) somatic
ciliary rows.
Type locality: Australian site (27), i.e., litter and surface soil from Green Island east of the town
of Cairns, 17°02'07''S, 145°05'09''E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype and two paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides,
see Fig. 12a–f in Chapter 5.
Etymology: australiensis refers to the continent the species was discovered.
Description: Of 12 features investigated, five have a coefficient of variation >15%, indicating
a rather distinct variability. As Rimaleptus similis australiensis is rather similar to the nominal
subspecies, I provide only a schematic in vivo illustration and a brief description. Identification
needs protargol impregnation and morphometry. For terminology, see Vd’ačný & Foissner (2012).
Size in protargol preparations 197–322 × 25–53 µm, on average 256 × 36 µm (Table 12). When
15% preparation shrinkage is added, in vivo values are obtained: 225–370 × 29–60 µm, on average
300 × 35 µm. Body shape rather variable, i.e., very narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio
of about 7.3:1. Proboscis of ordinary length, i.e., 43% of body length on average (Fig. 27a; Table
12). Posterior body end rounded, never tailed (Fig. 27a, c, 28a–d, g, j–o; Table 12). Two slightly
drumstick-shaped macronuclear nodules slightly anterior of mid-trunk. Micronucleus in between
macronuclear nodules, globular (Fig. 27a, c, 28a–d, g–o; Table 12). About eight contractile vacuoles
in proximal portion of proboscis and dorsal side of trunk; pores usually single in proboscis, two or
three pores in trunk (Fig. 27a, 28p). Oral bulge extrusomes very narrowly ellipsoid, about 6 µm long
in vivo (Fig. 27a, e). I did not look for the minute, fine extrusomes present in two populations of
the nominal subspecies (Vd’ačný & Foissner 2012). Cortex very flexible, ordinarily granulated, i.e.,

Foissner et al. (2002, p. 409).
Bophryidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Colpodidiida with a single, complete
adoral organelle 3; horizontally oriented paroral
membrane; and a contractile vacuole close posterior
to oral apparatus. Usually with conspicuous,
trichocyst-like extrusomes and a fine-meshed
silverline pattern. Buccal cavity absent.
Type genus: Bophrya nov. gen.
Genera assignable: → Bophrya nov. gen.; → Wolf­

Adam, 1981.
Remarks: There is no doubt that the genera
mentioned above belong to the class Nassophorea

very specific feature of the genera mentioned above.
Traditionally, the “complete” organelle is termed
“nassulid organelle 3” because organelles 1 and 2 are
highly reduced or even absent (Foissner et al. 2002).
Bophrya nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Moderately-sized, ellipsoid and laterally flattened, holotrichously ciliated Nassophorea
with broad cortical stripes containing globular anterior end (“head”) of cortical mitochondria
each associated with a membranous, minute cone causing a serrate cell outline. Oral apparatus
with a unique, convex shield (scutum) extending over adoral organelles and entrance to oral basket
lengthening horizontally to dorsal side where it curves posteriorly.
Type species: Bophrya costata nov. spec.
Etymology: Bophrya is a composite of Bo (Botswana, the country where the type species was
discovered), and the Greek noun phrya (eyebrow ~cilia ~ciliate), meaning a ciliate from Botswana.
Feminine gender.

Remarks: Bophrya appears as a curious “composite” of several nassophorid genera: body flattened as
in the Microthoracida (Foissner 1985); ciliature holotrichous as common in the Nassulida (Foissner et
al. 2002); broad cortical stripes, a rare feature found only in two other genera, viz., Pseudomicrothorax
(Foissner et al. 1994) and Lopezoterenia Foissner, 1997c; large, trichocyst-like extrusomes as, e.g., in

(Fig. 29a–l, 30a–t, 31a–h; Table 13 on p. 318)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 50 × 40 µm. Broadly ellipsoid with an inconspicuous concavity in oral
area far subapically. Nuclear apparatus in mid-body. Extrusomes very narrowly cuneate, conspicuous
because about 10.0 × 1.5 µm in size. Cortex, somatic and oral infraciliature, and location of
contractile vacuole as diagnosed for family and genus. 18 slightly convex ciliary rows: seven each
on right and left side, four postoral; somatic ciliary row 1 with ciliated dikinetids at level of oral
apparatus; preoral suture clavate. Nassulid organelle 3 minute, composed of six vertical ciliary rows.
Paroral membrane oblique, composed of about 18 dikinetids each having ciliated only one basal

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Etymology: Costata is a Latin adjective referring to the cortical ridges.
Description: Bophrya costata is a conspicuous species due to the broad cortical stripes and the
nearly discoid body shape. It has a low variability: of 24 features investigated, only two (number
of monokinetids in somatic kinety 3, mesh size of silverline pattern) have a coefficient of variation
higher than 15% (Table 13).
Size in vivo about 50 × 40 µm and 47.3 × 36.7 µm on average in Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate
preparations; adding 5% preparation shrinkage (Foissner 2014) results in 49.7 × 38.5 µm matching
well the in vivo measurements (Table 13). Body broadly ellipsoid or almost discoid because flattened
laterally about 2:1, or broadly ovate because moderately narrowed preorally. Dorsal side more convex

exploded, extrusome holes occasionally recognizable within and left of somatic kineties (Fig. 29i,
30k). Posterior end sometimes not unfolded and thus looking like tip of hymenostome trichocysts,
e.g., from Paramecium (Fig. 29k, 30d, i). Fully exploded extrusomes acicular and up to 80 µm long
(Fig. 29l). Cortex colourless, strongly furrowed by broad pustulate stripes/ribs due to mitochondrial
“heads” associated with minute cones hardly recognizable in vivo where cell margin appears studded
with small convexities produced by mitochondrial heads. Cones generated by cortex, 0.5–1.5 µm
high, longitudinally striated. Mitochondria vermiform, up to 8 µm long, with a conspicuous “head”
1.0–1.5 µm across (Fig. 29a, c, d, 30a, b, e, f, 31a–d, g, h). Cytoplasm colourless, contains many
lipid droplets 1–3 µm across and some food vacuoles 3–10 µm in diameter and filled with minute
bacteria providing contents with a granular appearance (Fig. 29a, 30a, b, d). Silverline pattern
narrowly meshed, individual meshes 0.5–2.0 µm in size (Fig. 30g, h, m, n; Table 13). Movement
inconspicuous, i.e., creeps and swims moderately rapid rotating about longitudinal axis.
Cilia about 8 µm long in vivo and in SEM micrographs, arranged in 18 longitudinal, slightly
curved rows: seven each on right and left side, four postoral; commence slightly subapical producing
cuneate preoral suture. Ciliature rather sparse, many left side kinetids not ciliated; monokinetal
except of some ciliated dikinetids in kinety 1 right of oral apparatus; intrakinetidal space increasing
from anterior to posterior (Fig. 29a, f–i, 30e–h, j–t, 31a–e; Table 13).
Oral apparatus inconspicuous but rather complex, in shallow concavity far subapical (Fig. 29a,
f, g, i, 30a, b, e, g, h, j–m, o–s, 31a, d, e, h; Table 13). Very likely three adoral organelles but only

organelle 3, near right end of paroral membrane, complete and thus distinct, composed of three
rows of basal bodies each having six cilia up to 8 µm long in vivo (Fig. 29a, 31d, h). Organelles 1
and 2 appear as dikinetids at anterior end of postoral kineties 4 and 3; organelle 1 (Fig. 30q) usually
absent. Paroral membrane in vivo and in silver nitrate preparations about 10 µm long, obliquely
arranged and composed of about nine rather thick granules each with a 4 µm long cilium; in silver
carbonate and protargol preparations about 18 dikinetids arranged in indistinct pairs (Fig. 30j–o,
q–s; Table 13); details should be clarified by TEM investigations. Oral field with a convex shield
(scutum) extending over bases of adoral organelles and opening of oral basket in vivo about 6 µm
wide at distal end, extends to dorsal side where it curves to near posterior body end becoming
gradually very narrow (~1 µm); composed of about 12 rods with concave distal end (Fig. 29b);
basket opening deeply impregnating with silver carbonate possibly due to a ring of basal bodies (Fig.
30o, s).
Resting cyst: Inconspicuous because in vivo only 30 µm across and a 1.5–2.0 µm thick, externally
slightly wrinkled wall (Fig. 29e, 31f). Studded with 0.5–2.0 µm-sized lipid droplets and 15–25
extrusomes most around macronucleus. Cell or wall with very fine longitudinal lines, very likely
caused by somatic kineties; rarely recognizable.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type localiy. Bophrya costata appeared 5 d after
rewetting the sample and reached moderate abundance in the non-flooded Petri dish culture after
10 d.
Remarks: This ciliate is easily identified because it has several uncommon features: a discoid
body shape, large extrusomes, and broad cortical stripes. Such stripes occur only in two other
nassophoreans, viz., Pseudomicrothorax (for a review, see Foissner et al. 1994), which has three
complete nassulid adoral organelles left of the oral basket entrance (vs. one close posterior to right
end of paroral membrane) and in Lopezoterenia Foissner, 1997. Further, Pseudomicrothorax has a
smooth cortex while that of Bophrya is pustulate due to the headed mitochondria, a unique feature
not known from any other ciliate. The same applies to the oral shield unique in nassophoreans.
Wolfkosia Foissner, Agatha & Berger, 2002
Although I did not (yet?) find Wolfkosia in Australia, I describe a new species each from Botswana
and the Brazilian Pantanal. The type species, W. loeffleri, was discovered in Costa Rica and occurs
also in two African sites, viz., in Saudi Arabia and Namibia (Foissner et al. 2002). These data suggest
a Gondwanan distribution of the genus because I did not find it in hundreds of Laurasian samples.
Wolfkosia acuta nov. spec.
(Fig. 32a–f, 33a–n; Table 14 on p. 319)
Diagnosis (averages are provided): Size in vivo 70 × 25 µm; oblanceolate with posterior end bluntly
acute. Macronucleus usually in posterior half of cell. Extrusomes normally cuneate, 9 µm long. 18
somatic ciliary rows and 10 vertical ciliary rows in nassulid organelle 3. Paroral membrane dome-
shaped, composed of 13 dikinetids.

Description: This species was very rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture, i.e., I found only a
single specimen and thus live observation is incomplete. Fortunately, I found nearly 20 specimens in
the silver nitrate preparations; together, the observations provide a solid description.
Of 18 features measured, six have a coefficient of variation >15%, suggesting moderate variability
(Table 14).
Size in vivo 60–75 × 15–30 µm, on average about 70 × 25 µm when 5% preparation shrinkage
have been added. Body usually oblanceolate, rarely elongate ellipsoid or ellipsoid; posterior end
usually bluntly acute, rarely narrowly rounded (Fig. 32b, f, 33a–c, f, k, l; Table 14). Nuclear apparatus

Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. In the non-flooded Petri dish, it
appeared 24 h after rewetting the sample, indicating a r-selected way of life. The abundance was very
low and the species did not re-appear after looting the culture for preparations.
Remarks: Wolfkosia acuta is possibly most closely related to → W. pantanalensis (Fig. 32b, j, 33a–
c, f–h, k; Table 14). Morphologically, these species differ by body shape (with acute vs. broadly
rounded posterior region; Fig. 32b, j) and the paroral membrane which is inverted U-shaped vs.
moderately convex (Fig. 32f, j). Morphometrically, they differ by body length (67 µm vs. 53 µm),
by the ratio body length:width (2.9:1 vs. 2.4:1) and by the distance between anterior body end and
macronucleus (38 µm vs. 23 µm). The most conspicuous differences are the acute (vs. ellipsoid) body
shape and the inverted U-shaped (vs. moderately convex) paroral membrane.

Fig. 35q–v. Wolfkosia pantanalensis after Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate impregnation. In this preparation (cp. Fig. 35l–
p) details of the oral apparatus are well recognizable, for instance, the paroral membrane which consists of seven or eight
dikinetids forming minute squares (q, u, v). Nassulid organelle 3 is composed of eight kineties with three basal bodies
each (u) while organelle 2 consists of five scattered granules (q, t–v). The posterior half of somatic kinety 1 consists of
zigzagging dikinetids (t, u). The pore of the contractile vacuole is close to the posterior end of somatic kinety 1 (r–u).
Body shape is ovate in ventral view (q) while obovate in left side view (r). The shape of the specimen in (s) highly
resembles → Wolfkosia acuta. CY – cytopyge, EP – excretory pore of contractile vacuole, NO2,3 – nassulid organelles,

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
For slides, see Fig. 15a–g in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Named after the region discovered, i.e., the famous Pantanal wetland in Brazil.
Description: This species was rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Of 20 features measured,
only the location of the macronucleus and the number of paroral dikinetids have a coefficient of
variation >15%, indicating low variability.
Size in vivo 45–65 × 20–30 µm, as calculated from some in vivo measurements and the
morphometric data in Table 14. In lateral view ellipsoid or slightly obovate; slightly flattened, ventral
view thus ellipsoid or slightly elongate ellipsoid (Fig. 34a–c, 35e, g; Table 14). Nuclear apparatus in
mid-body, in vivo about 15 µm across while only 8 µm in silver nitrate preparations very likely due
to strong shrinkage, as in congeners; nucleolus reticulate (Fig. 34a, b, 35b, k; Table 14); a minute
micronucleus in small concavity of macronucleus. Contractile vacuole posterior of oral apparatus,
excretory pore underneath posterior region of somatic kinety 1 (Fig. 34a–c, 35a, b, l; Table 14).
Cytopyge in line with excretory pore, extends in posterior half of cell (Fig. 34b, 35l). Resting
extrusomes attached almost perpendicularly to cortex, narrowly obovate or cuneate, conspicuous
because about 10.0 × 1.5–2.0 µm in vivo and in silver nitrate preparations, comparatively rare and
thus not forming a fringe; breaks into sharp-edged pieces when strongly pressed with coverslip;
when expelled, cell performs a jerky movement and the extrusome elongates to an about 80 µm
long rod with acute ends (Fig. 34a, e–g, 35a, d, h–j; Table 14). Cortex bright and about 1 µm
thick, with distinct ciliary pits providing outline with many minute convexities (Fig. 34a, 35d, g).
Most mitochondria underneath cortex, conspicuous because numerous and 4–6 µm long, many
serpentine (Fig. 35a, o, p). Cytoplasm colourless, usually studded with food vacuoles only 2–3 µm
across and containing 2–6 minute, ellipsoid bacteria; usually some larger vacuoles about 15 µm
across and with loose contents (Fig. 34a, 35a–c). Moves rapidly appearing like a swimming ellipsoid.
Somatic and oral ciliature as well as silverline pattern as in type species (Foissner et al. 2002),
except of some morphometrics (Fig. 34b–d, 35l–n, q–v; Table 14). Some additional data (Fig.
34a–d, 35l, m): distal end of oral basket hardly projecting and cornered, composed of 10–12 rods
extending to dorsal side and forming an indistinct basket; paroral cilia about 7 µm long, only one
basal body of dikinetids ciliated; cilia of nassulid organelle 3 about 4 µm long in vivo.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Recognized 7 d after rewetting the
dry sample, indicating a k-selected lifestyle. The abundance was low and the species did not recover
after looting the culture for preparations. More detailed site and sample data, see Foissner (2003).
Remarks: At first glance, W. pantanalensis highly resembles W. loeffleri, type species of the
genus discovered in Costa Rica, Central America (Foissner et al. 2002). However, there is at least
one distinct difference validated by a reinvestigation of the type species W. loeffleri, viz., the shape
and size of the extrusomes (narrowly cuneate or obovate and 10 µm long vs. fusiform and 4–5 µm
long (compare Fig. 106f in Foissner et al. 2002 and Fig. 34g, 35h; Table 14). Three morphometric
differences support this decision (Table 14): body length 55 µm vs. 45 µm; anterior body end to
nassulid organelle 3 (12 µm vs. 8 µm); number of somatic ciliary rows (18 vs. 14).
4.2.3 Colpodea
For some recent comments on this taxon by W. Foissner, see Foissner (2016, p. 264).
Bursaria Müller, 1773
Diagnosis: Moderately large to very large, bursiform Bursariidae (Colpodea) with keyhole-shaped
oral aperture extending from anterior body end to mid-body or to near posterior end. Paroral

formation (right oral polykinetid) on edge and inner side of dorsal and right wall of buccal cavity,
consists of many rather regularly spaced kineties forming a curved ribbon (septum). Adoral zone
very large, composed of many equidistantly spaced polykineties forming a sigmoid, proximally
slightly to strongly recurved ribbon.
Type species: Bursaria truncatella Müller, 1773 (by subsequent designation by Apstein 1915,
p. 122; see Aescht 2001, p. 35).
Remarks: The present investigations confirm the characterization by Foissner (1993), who
distinguished two species, viz., B. truncatella and B. ovata Beers, 1952, the second redescribed
by Foissner (2016). Here, five further species are described from Africa, Austria, the USA, and
Australia, based on morphologic and morphometric differences summarized in Fig. 36a–h, 37a,
Table 15, and the identification key (see below).
Discussion of main features: Bursaria species are rather difficult to investigate due to their large
size. A combination of live observation and various silver techniques is indispensable. The basic
morphology, as described by Foissner (1993), is very similar in the seven species distinguished while
pronounced morphometric differences are frequent (Table 15). For instance, the large B. ovata has
the smallest adoral polykineties.
Each species is characterized morphometrically and shown by a multitude of figures. Based on
these data, the valuable features shown in Table 15 were selected.
Body size: The smallest species are → B. africana (~305 µm) and B. truncatella (376 µm;
Table 15), the largest are → B. fluviatilis (681 µm) and → B. americana (~500 µm). Although body
size depends on various environmental conditions, the considerable distance (400 µm) between the
smallest and the largest species suggests body size as a valuable feature for some species (Fig. 37a).
Anterior body end to posterior end of oral (ventral) cleft in percent of body length: Surprisingly, this
feature is very variable and rather similar in all species, suggesting it as a minor character for species
identification. The smallest value is 48% in B. fluviatilis, the largest value is 64% in B. ovata.
Posterior body end to deepest point of left oral polykinetid in percent of body length: The lowest
values belong to → B. americana (10%) and → B. truncatella (17%) while the highest values occur in
the Australian species → B. fluviatilis (31%) and → B. uluruensis (29%). The considerable differences
between the lowest and highest value suggests this as a valuable species character.
Number of ciliary rows: Although the ciliary rows are difficult to count, they are a valuable
feature: the lowest value (215 rows in the Austrian B. truncatella) is much smaller than the highest
(581 rows) in → B. americana.
Number of polykineties in left oral polykinetid: This is a very valuable character because it separates →
B. fluviatilis (72) clearly from, e.g. → B. ovata (148), → B. uluruensis (103), and → B. salisburgensis (101).
Maximum width of adoral polykineties: This is also a valuable character because it separates → B.
fluviatilis (63 µm), → B. uluruensis (62 µm), and → B. americana (64) from → B. ovata (33 µm), → B.
truncatella (50 µm), and → B. salisburgensis (51). Briefly, the width of the largest polykineties is >60
µm in the first group while about ≤50 µm in the second group.
Shape of the left oral polykinetid: It is distinctly recurved in → B. ovata (Fig. 36f; Foissner 2016),
→ B. uluruensis (Fig. 36d), → B. americana (Fig. 36g, h), and → B. salisburgensis (Fig. 36e) while not
or indistinctly recurved in → B. fluviatilis (Fig. 36c), → B. africana (Fig. 36b), and B. truncatella (Fig.
36a). This is an important feature because it separates, e.g., B. truncatella from B. salisburgensis.
Extrusome shape and height of cortical extrusome fringe: There are three types of extrusomes
(rod-like, globular, unstructured) which distinguish several species very clearly (Fig. 27b) but the
investigation is difficult in the rod-shaped type.
Barren stripe along right oral polykinetid: Possibly, this is an important feature because the stripe
is absent in two of the four populations investigated in the scanning electron microscope (Table 15).
Unfortunately, data are lacking for the other species.

the USA. The left oral polykinetid of the left
specimen is twisted posteriorly, possibly due to
the preparation procedure.
Granular cortex vacuoles (Fig. 46p, q): This organelle, first described by Foissner (2016), has been
observed in → B. salisburgensis, → B. uluruensis, and → B. ovata (Foissner 2016) when cells were fixed
in Stieve’s fluid. In → B. americana fixed with this fluid, granular vacuoles were absent, indicating
that these vacuoles could be a valuable species feature.
Shape and size of resting cyst: Distinct morphological differences are absent while the size, e.g., is
conspicuously smaller in → B. africana (153 µm) than in the other species (190–328 µm).

Molecular phylogeny (Fig. 38): The five species investigated differ only slightly in the nuclear
SSU-DNA. Two clades can be recognized: one contains the species with rod-shaped extrusomes, viz.,
→ B. ovata and → B. americana while the other clade contains the species with globular or unstructured
(→ B. salisburgensis) extrusomes, viz., → B. truncatella, → B. fluviatilis, and → B. uluruensis. The two
last mentioned species as well as → B. truncatella have very similar nuclear sequences although they
are distinct morphospecies.
Key to Bursaria species
The key uses only three features shown in Fig. 37a, b: the shape of the left polykinetid, the distance
from posterior body end to the deepest point of the left oral polykinetid (% of body length), and the
shape of the extrusomes (careful live observation indispensable, left row in Fig. 37b drawn to scale,
20 µm). For details, see description of individual species and Tables 15–18.

Geographic distribution: Over the years, I found many Bursaria populations but only
some I investigated in detail. This showed at least seven species one of which, → B. ovata, has
been redescribed by Foissner (2016). I discovered also a new cortical organelle, viz., granular
(“curious”) vacuoles in most species (Fig. 46p, q). These vacuoles become recognizable only after
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 55–345 / 154

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Stieve fixation; they are about 20 × 15 µm in size and are distinctly granulated by argyrophilic
material (Foissner 2016).
Bursaria species have resting cysts with a thick wall that has an escape opening (Fig. 42a, b,
f–i, 44n, q, 48s, t, v, Table 15). In spite of this, only → B. truncatella and → B. ovata have a wide
distribution. The former has been reported from Central Europe (this paper), Namibia (Foissner et
al. 2002), the Neotropis (Foissner 2016), and very likely from Antarctica (for a review, see Foissner
1993). The latter has been reported from Europe and Russia, the USA, Botswana (Africa), and the
Neotropis (for reviews, see Foissner 1993, 2016, Foissner et al. 2002). The unique Australian species
(→ B. fluviatilis and → B. uluruensis) suggest a restricted distribution of at least some species.
There are many reports on → B. truncatella (for a review, see Foissner 1993). Very likely, most are
misidentifications, e.g., the New Zealand population studied by Bary (1950), which is very likely
→ B. fluviatilis or → B. uluruensis as indicated by the short left oral polykinetid. However, usually it
is impossible to re-identify the old descriptions mainly because the extrusomes have been not or
insufficiently described.
Description of Bursaria species
Bursaria truncatella Müller, 1773
(Fig. 36a, 37a, b, 38, 39a–g; Tables 15, 16 on p. 321, 322)
Material: The population described was found in a temporary, eutrophic (by excrements of grazing
cows) pond in the Austrian Central Alps (47°N, 12°47'E) about 2000 m above sea level (detailed
description, see Foissner 1980, Weidetümpel 1).
Improved diagnosis (excludes all literature data; measurements are from silver nitrate-
impregnated specimens, add 5% preparation shrinkage to obtain in vivo values; averages are given,
see Table 16 for extremes): Bursiform with left side flat or slightly concave, right side more or less
convex; body size 376 × 190 µm; ventral cleft extends 54% of body length. Left oral polykinetid
not recurved, consists of 83 polykineties with a maximum width of 50 µm, deepest point at 17%
of body length. About 215 ciliary rows. Extrusomes slenderly ellipsoid, 3–4 µm long. Resting cyst
about 140 µm in vivo.
Type locality: Surroundings of the town of Copenhagen (55°41'N, 12°35'E), Denmark, where
Müller (1786) discovered rich populations in ditches and shady swamps containing decaying beech
leaves.
Possibly, the species should be neotypified but this should await further investigations of
populations from Central Europe or, ideally, from the type area. The Austrian population described
here is possibly a mountain variety, as mentioned below.
Voucher material: Six slides of the Austrian population with silver nitrate-impregnated
specimens (Chatton-Lwoff method) have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper
Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 16a–g in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Not given in original description; truncatella is a Latin diminutive meaning “a
minute trunk with blunt anterior end”.
Remarks: The Austrian population of B. truncatella is rather similar to the Botswanan → B.
africana but differs significantly in the shape of the extrusomes: 3–4 µm long rods vs. 3–4 µm-sized
globules (Fig. 37b, c, 39l, 40p–v, 41a–d, f). Of the other characteristics compiled in Table 15, the
following might be of value although they overlap more or less distinctly: length:width ratio 2.0:1
vs. 1.6:1 (Fig. 36a, b, 37a, 39a, b, d, 40a–k, 41e, i, j, Table 15); deepest point of left polykinetid 17%

Bursaria truncatella and → B. africana are distinctly smaller than the other species (Fig. 37a;

several authors mentioned small (fit to my data) and large (up to 1700 µm) varieties (for a review,
see Foissner 1993), indicating that the population from the Austrian Alps is not an exception.

Fig. 40p–v. Bursaria africana, Botswanan specimens from life (p, q, s, t), after protargol impregnation (u), and
methyl green-pyronin staining (r, v). p–v: Surface views (p, q) and optical sections (s–u), showing the 3–4 µm
thick alveolar layer (opposed arrowheads in s, u). The alveoli (p, s, t) contain globular mucocysts (q, s, t) which are
extruded when methyl green-pyronin is applied (v), and then they elongate, forming a three-dimensional reticulum
(r). E – extrusomes (mucocysts), L – lipid droplets, V – cytoplasmic vacuoles. Scale bars 5 µm (s–u), 10 µm (p, q, v),
and 100 µm (r).
Etymology: The Latin adjective africana means “belonging to or from Africa”.
Remarks: In vivo body size about 320–400 × 220–300 µm (n = 5), which matches the size
in preparations (Tables 15, 16). Specimens from the non-flooded Petri dish culture contained
food vacuoles with the testate amoeba Arcella sp., the ciliate Urosoma sp., heliozoans, and eggs of
nematodes (Fig. 39h).

Bursaria africana is morphologically most closely related to → B. truncatella, e.g., in body size,
in the number of somatic ciliary rows, the shape of the adoral polykinetid, and the number and size
of the adoral polykineties (Tables 15, 16). Main differences are the extrusome shape (globular vs.
rod-like) and the small (11% vs. 17% of body length) distance between posterior body end and the
deepest point of the adoral polykinetid (Fig. 36b, 37b, 39h, 40b, c, g, 41e; Tables 15, 16).

The morphology of B. americana is quite similar to that of the congeners and documented by
a multitude of Figures (Fig. 43a–z, 44a–r). The preparations are very clear and thus one can see
the cortical fibre system (Fig. 43d, 44b, c, i) and the reticular silverline pattern in the cortex of the
buccal cavity (Fig. 43p, 44k–m); it extends also between the adoral polykineties (Fig. 44k). The huge
buccal cavity is very distinct (Fig. 43a, b) while the adoral polykinetid is not as distinctly recurved
as in → B. ovata (Fig. 43v, w, 44a). Very likely, B. americana lacks granular vacuoles. Description of
resting cyst, see Foissner (1993).

Bursaria salisburgensis nov. spec.
(Fig. 36e, 37a, b, 45a–e; Tables 15, 17 on p. 321, 323)
Material: This species was discovered in the surrounding of the town of Salzburg, Austria, i.e., in a
small, permanent forest pond on the hill to the Neuhaus castle. Environmental specimens were used
for most investigations.
Diagnosis (most measurements are from protargol-impregnated specimens; add 20% preparation
shrinkage to obtain in vivo values; averages are given, see Tables 15, 17 for extremes): Broadly
lenticular or ellipsoid, ventrally flattened, dorsally convex; body size 444 × 289 µm; ventral cleft
extends 53% of body length. Left oral polykinetid recurved, consists of 101 polykineties with a
maximum width of 51 µm, deepest point at 20% of body length. 455 ciliary rows. Extrusomes form
a 3–4 µm, structureless plate; when disturbed 5 µm long rods become recognizable. With “granular
vacuoles”.
Type locality: Permanent forest pond in the surrounding of the town of Salzburg, Austria,
47°47'N, 13°02'E.
Type material: The protargol slide containing the holotype and six paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on
the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 19a–h in Chapter 5.

Remarks: Bursaria salisburgensis differs from all congeners by the extrusomes which form a 3–4
µm thick, structureless plate in the cortex. Only when disturbed 4–5 × 2 µm-sized rods become
recognizable (Fig. 37b). I checked this carefully in three specimens, and the observations were
confirmed in protargol-impregnated specimens, showing a structureless, not impregnated, 3–8 µm
thick zone in the periphery of the cortex (Fig. 45e). In most other characteristics, B. salisburgensis
resembles → B. uluruensis, except of the much longer left oral polykinetid (Fig. 37b; Table 15).
Bursaria salisburgensis has “granular (curious) vacuoles” very similar to those of → B. uluruensis.

Etymology: Named after the site discovered, i.e., the aboriginal noun Uluru (Ayers Rock) which
is the type locality.
Remarks: Bursaria uluruensis is a “typical” congener (see diagnosis) and could be cultivated with
Paramecium aurelia as food. Like some congeners, it has granular vacuoles in the cortex (Fig. 46p,
q). The extrusomes belong to the globular type and are 3–5 µm across (Fig. 37b, 46c, 47g). When
disturbed, the globules become 3–4 µm long rods (Fig. 27b, 46d–f, 47h–j) highly similar to those
in undisturbed → B. truncatella. When the rods are extruded, they become slenderly conical (Fig.

the cell (Fig. 46l, m, 47k).
Bursaria uluruensis is rather similar to the second Australian species, → B. fluviatilis: both have

freely motile specimens, showing variability of body shape and the huge buccal cavity (b, h, i). The arrow in (i) marks
the deepest point of the left oral polykinetid, i.e., the site where it commences recurving; compared to most congeners,
this is far away from the posterior body end and thus an important feature of this species. c–f: Bursaria uluruensis has
a 3–4 µm thick extrusome fringe marked by opposed arrowheads. When resting, the extrusomes are globular and about
3 µm across (c). When the cell is slightly disturbed, the extrusomes explode becoming 3–5 µm long rods (d–f). See Fig.

(Fig. 36c, 37a, 47a–f, 48a–x; Tables 15, 18 on p. 321, 324)
Material: Bursaria fluviatilis was discovered in soil from the floodplain of the Murray River near to
the town of Albury, southern Australia. It was also observed in the plankton of this river. The species
was cultivated in dirty cultures set up with a few milliliters from the non-flooded Petri dish culture
and feed with some squashed wheat grains.
Diagnosis (measurements are from protargol-impregnated specimens; add 15% preparation
shrinkage to obtain in vivo values; averages are given, see Tables 15 and 18 for extremes): Bursiform,
left margin frequently concave, right more or less convex; body size 681 × 442 µm; oral cleft extends

Type locality: Floodplain soil from the Murray River near to the town of Albury, waterside of
Ryans road, Australia, 37°S, 147°E. See also footnote at → Levispatha australiensis nov. spec.
Type material: Six slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology
Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have
been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 21a–g in Chapter 5.
Etymology: The Latin adjective fluviatilis (pertaining to rivers) refers to the habitat the species
was discovered.

Remarks: The Australian population (Fig. 49a–d) matches the type population from a Eucalyptus
forest south of Tel Aviv (Israel). Very likely, E. augustini is a cosmopolitan (Foissner 1993, 1998).
However, a complex of similar morphospecies is also possible because the resting cysts are rather
different: those from the hot Namib desert have a very thick wall while cysts from the temperate
Austria have a much thinner wall (Foissner 2011). Unfortunately, I did not investigate the cysts of
the type material and the Australian population.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Description: This species was very rare and thus recognized only in the protargol preparations.
Accordingly, live observations are lacking. However, Gastronauta insula is so distinct that description
without live observations seems justified.
Gastronauta insula is rather variable (many CV’s>15%), for instance, body length varies between
21 µm and 42 µm and most distances (Table 19).
Size in protargol preparations 21–42 × 15–25 µm, on average 33 × 21 µm, in vivo about 38
× 24 µm when 15% preparation shrinkage is added. Body broadly ellipsoid, ovoid or depressed,
i.e., right margin distinctly convex, left straight or slightly convex (Fig. 50a–c, 51a–d; Table 19).
Both ends broadly rounded, posterior end rarely slightly to distinctly notched. Dorsoventrally
flattened 2–4:1, ventral side flat, postoral dorsal side with more or less distinct hump sometimes
slightly projecting from body proper. Nuclear apparatus usually in rear body half, rarely in mid-body
(Fig. 50a, c, 51a–d; Table 15); globular to broadly ellipsoid, contains a large central nucleolus(?)
impregnating faintly and many small, globular to polygonal peripheral nucleoli impregnating
deeply. Micronucleus attached to various sites of macronucleus, rarely some micrometers distant
from macronucleus; globular to broadly ellipsoid. Two contractile vacuoles located as in congeners,
i.e., upper pore subapical between kineties 1 and 2 of right ciliary field, posterior pore between
posterior end of kineties 3 and 4 of left ciliary field (Fig. 50a, 51b; Table 19). Cytoplasm usually
rather clear because containing only few food vacuoles with flagellates (Chlamydomonas?), small
euglenids (Anisonema?), and fungal spores(?). Most specimens contain 5–10 µm long bacilli with a
terminal spore.
Somatic and oral infraciliature as in congeners, differing mainly in morphometric features. Thus,
I describe here only some minor specialties and refer the reader to Fig. 50a–e, 51a–h and, especially,
to the detailed morphometry (Table 19). Leftmost kinety of left ciliary field usually interrupted
at level of circumoral kinety, the upper portion becoming vertical kinety 1; in other cells no break
recognizable or only a wider spacing of basal bodies (Fig. 51b). Basal bodies in posterior region of
kineties more widely spaced than anteriorly.
Anlage for dorsal brush absent in about one third of cells. Brush extends along anterior curve of
cell, composed of three widely spaced clusters each with two up to 10 µm long bristles; basal bodies
of middle cluster widely separate in some cells.
Circumoral kinety on average (oral cleft) 10.0 × 2.7 µm in protargol preparations, basal bodies
more narrowly spaced in posterior half than in anterior half. Oral basket extends to near posterior
body end.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. This is the first terricolous species
of the genus. However, I cannot exclude that Gastronauta insula is a brackish water species because
the sample was taken from the coast of the island.
Remarks: In the last revision of the genus, Foissner (2000) recognized three well described
species: the common Gastronauta membranaceus (Fig. 50d, e), G. aloisi as yet found only in activated
sludge; and G. derouxi, a marine species. Gastronauta insula differs from these species, inter alia, by
body size and the total number of somatic ciliary rows: G. insula 33 × 21 µm, 17; G. membranaceus
48 × 28 µm, 22; G. aloisi 45 × 35 µm, 23; G. derouxi 61 × 38 µm, 23. Further, G. insula has a unique
dorsal brush: three clusters with a total of six bristles in anterior quarter of cell; G. membranaceus
has two clusters with a total of 17 bristles in anterior third of cell (Fig. 50e); G. aloisi has 3–5
clusters with a total of 12 bristles along anterior body margin; and G. derouxi has 5–7 clusters with
a total of 12–16 bristles along anterior body margin. These data show that G. insula is a distinct,
possibly endemic species.
Deroux (1994) founded the monotypic family Gastronautidae. Foissner (2000) agreed and
established a new, monotypic genus, Paragastronauta, for species without a barren postoral stripe.

Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 34 × 19 µm; ellipsoid. One globular macronucleus. Pore of contractile
vacuole distinctly subterminal (at 16% of body length) at end of somatic kinety 2. Extrusomes
slightly cuneate, about 5 µm long, form bundles between kinetids of somatic kineties. Usually 13
ciliary rows, dorsal rows each composed of an average of six dikinetids ciliated in oral area while
anterior basal body barren in postoral region; one caudal cilium. Oral apparatus extends about 76%
of body length; adoral membranelle 1 rhomboid, membranelle 2 cuneate and composed of seven
ciliary aggregates. Scutica composed of one dikinetid right of cytopyge and slightly posterior to
paroral vertex, and of two widely spaced dikinetids left of cytopyge, i.e., almost in line with last
ciliary row.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
consider the different scutica and extrusome pattern as sufficient for a distinct species. However, the
recent progress in ciliate taxonomy (e.g., Kumar & Foissner 2016) and the different biogeographic
regions suggest the Namibian population as a distinct species. Foissner et al. (2002) provided the
following species comparison: “The Namibian population matches the type and neotype population
in most morphometrics (Table 102). It differs, however, in body shape because it is postorally
slightly narrowed making cells obovoidal (Fig. 120k, m; 373a–d). Furthermore, the Namibian
specimens are more slender (length:width ratio 2.5:1 vs. 2:1 in ventral and 1.9:1 vs. 1.7:1 in lateral
view) and usually slightly longer (33 µm vs. 29 µm long on average; Table 102) than the Austrian
ones. The extrusomes are often clustered and form a distinct fringe and rather conspicuous tubercles
recognizable even at low (×l50) magnification on the cell surface (Fig. 120d–f, k; 373e, f). The last
somatic ciliary row is not only shortened by one kinetid posteriorly, as in the Austrian population,
but terminates at the level of the peristomial vertex. Additionally, the oral apparatus is larger than in
the Austrian specimens (usually terminating 58% vs. 66% back from anterior body end), the adoral
membranelles are more posteriorly located (distance to anterior body end 6.7 µm vs. 3.5 µm), the
paroral membrane often forms a small hook distally, and jumping is more pronounced”.
Protocyclidium bimacronucleatum nov. spec.
(Fig. 53a, b, 54a–f; Table 20 on p. 326)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 33 × 21 µm; broadly ellipsoid. Two abutting macronuclear nodules.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
anterior basal body barren in postoral portion; one caudal cilium. Oral apparatus extends about
77% of body length; adoral membranelle 1 rectangular, membranelle 2 cuneate and composed
of six or seven ciliary aggregates. Scutica composed of a single dikinetid right of cytopyge and of
two dikinetids left of cytopyge, both clearly separate from proximal end of paroral membrane and
somatic kineties.
Type locality: Australian site (170), i.e., ephemeral puddles on top of Ayers Rock, 863 m above
sea level, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, central Australia, 25°20'42''S, 131°02'10''E.
Type material: The protargol slide1 containing the holotype (Fig. 53a, b) and paratype specimens
has been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype
and relevant paratype specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides,
see Fig. 24a, b in chapter 5.
Etymology: The Latin bimacronucleatum (two macronuclei) refers to the main feature of the
species, viz., the two macronuclear nodules.
Description and remarks: Protocyclidium bimacronucleatum is highly similar – both
morphologically and morphometrically – to the Austrian mononucleate neotype of P. terricola
described by Foissner et al. (2002). Thus, I provide only some notes and photographs and refer
the reader to the diagnosis. The main difference is the macronucleus, viz. one nodule in P. terricola,
two in P. bimacronucleatum. Another, but small difference, concerns the scutica which is nearer to
the proximal part of the paroral membrane in P. terricola than in P. bimacronucleatum. Further, the
quadrangular cortex structure is more prominent in P. bimacronucleatum; however, this is likely a
preparation effect.
4.2.6 Microsporidia
Microsporidium protocyclidicola nov. spec.
(Fig. 54f–i, 55a–h; Table 21 on p. 326)
Diagnosis (based on protargol-impregnated, mounted specimens): Two stages of the life cycle were
observed. Stage 1 (possibly meronts): globular with an average diameter of about 5 µm and an about
1 µm-sized nucleus; can divide; about 10 parasites/host. Stage 2 (possible sporoblasts): globular to
ellipsoid with an average size of 10 × 6 µm and an about 3 µm-sized nucleus; very likely does not
divide but originating from stage 1 parasites.
Type host: Cytoplasm of the ciliate Protocyclidium bimacronucleatum nov. spec. described above.
Type locality: Australian site (170), i.e., ephemeral puddles on top of Ayers Rock, 863 m above
sea level, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, central Australia, 25°20'42''S, 131°02'10''E.
Type material: Three type slides (the slide2 containing the holotype, two paratype slides) with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype shows stage 1 and stage 2 parasites (Fig. 55e). Both, the holotype

and several paratype specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides, see
Fig. 24a, b in Chapter 5.
Etymology: The species name is a composite of the genus-group name Protocyclidium, the
thematic vowel ·i­, and the Latin verb colere (to live in), referring to the habitat the species was
discovered.
Description: I observed only protargol-impregnated parasites, and thus I cannot provide the full
life cycle. The infection rate was 100% in Protocyclidium bimacronucleatum both in morphostatic
(Fig. 55a–f) and dividing (Fig. 55g) cells. Very likely, the parasite is highly species-specific because
80 other species were not infected in the non-flooded Petri dish culture; however, rapacious ciliates
that feed on P. bimacronucleatum contain “empty” (without nucleus and plasm) parasites (Fig. 55h).

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Stage 1 parasites (possibly early meronts): They have a diameter of 3–9 µm (average 5 µm), i.e.,
the cells are small and do not impregnate with the protargol method used except of the nucleus
which lightly impregnates. On average, there are 9.5 parasites in each Protocyclidium (Fig. 55a–e;
Table 21). The nucleus has a diameter of about 1 µm and is usually out of the cell centre (Fig. 55a).
The plasm contains some granules. Stage 1 parasites can divide (Fig. 55b, c) and one or several
develop to stage 2 while the others degenerate, i.e., lose nucleus and plasm.
Stage 2 (possibly sporoblasts): These develop from stage 1 cells as evident from transition stages
(Fig. 55b, d, f). They have an average size of 10 × 6 µm and a 3–4 µm-sized, deeply impregnating
nucleus (Fig. 54i, 55e, f; Table 21). Some have a clear (unstained) cytoplasm (Fig. 54h) while it is
rather deeply impregnated and contains some granular material in other specimens (Fig. 54g, h, 55e,
f). Dividing stage 2 parasites have been not observed.
Remarks: Although I do not have the whole life cycle, I name this organism because (i) the two
stages seen appear highly characteristic, (ii) it is highly host-specific, and (iii) well documented by
micrographs (Fig. 54f–i, 55a–h; Table 21). The stages observed resemble meronts and sporoblasts
as described by Canning & Lom (1986) and a marine fish Microsporidium sp. described by Raabe
(reviewed in Canning & Lom 1986).
Until 1987 only four microsporidian parasites have been described from ciliates (for a review, see
Görtz 1987): “Lutz and Splendore (1908) found ciliates (Balantidium ?) in the gut of Bufo marinus
infected with Nosema balantidii. Hovasse (1950) observed a microsporidian, named Gurleya nova,
in the ciliate Spirobuetschliella chattoni, and Krüger (1956) found Telomyxa campanellae (Glugea
campanellae; Sprague 1977) in Campanella umbellaria. In this paper, we report on the infection
of two ciliates by microsporidia”. None of these closely resembles Microsporidium protocyclidicola.
More recently, Foissner (1993, 2016) and Foissner & Foissner (1995) described Ciliatosporidium
platyophryae making little feet in various colpodean ciliates.
4.2.7 Hypotrichida
For some recent comments on this taxon by W. Foissner, see Foissner (2016, p. 487).
Gonostomum affine (Stein, 1859) Sterki, 1878
(Fig. 56a–c)
Material: Australian site (32).1
Remarks: The Australian population highly resembles Gonostomum affine (for reviews, see
Berger 1999, 2011) and G. singhii Kamra et al., 2008 from an Australian site2 investigated by
Foissner (2016, p. 666). Gonostomum singhii differs from G. affine mainly by the transverse cirral
pattern. Here, I show the silverline pattern of G. affine. It is very fine-meshed with meshes 0.5–2.5
µm in size (Fig. 56a–c).
Afrogonostomum nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Oblong Gonostomatidae with transverse cirri. Ventral cirral pattern very similar to that
of Gonostomum affine. Specific cortical granules, postoral and caudal cirri absent.
1 Note by H. Berger: I did not find a note by W. Foissner where the Australian sites are listed and described in detail.
In addition, I did not find the silver slides.
2 Note by H. Berger: I did not find a detailed description of this site. According to Foissner (2016, p. 672), the sample
was composed of the upper 5 cm litter and soil under Nothofagus trees; pH 4.1, about 200 m above sea-level.

Type species: Afrogonostomum alveum nov. spec.
Etymology: Afrogonostomum is a composite of the Latin noun Africa, the thematic vowel ·o-,
and the Greek genus-group name Gonostomum (angled adoral zone of membranelles). Neuter
gender. For details on Gonostomum, see Aescht (2001) and Berger (1999, 2011).
Species assignable: Afrogonostomum alveum nov. spec.
Remarks: Foissner (2016, p. 611) established Apogonostomum which has transverse cirri while
caudal cirri are absent, as in Afrogonostomum. However, Apogonostomum species are tailed and have
many frontoventral and postoral cirral pairs while the oblong Afrogonostomum has only two frontal
pairs (Bharti et al. 2015; Foissner 2016).

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Gonostomum paronense Bharti et al., 2015, a species from an Italian paddy field, has the
characteristics of Apogonostomum pantanalense Foissner, 2016, the type species of Apogonostomum.
Thus, G. paronense is synonymized with A. pantanalense Foissner, 2016.1 Both species match well in
all morphological and morphometric features as well as in the habitat, indicating global distribution.
Afrogonostomum alveum nov. spec.
(Fig. 57a–c, 58a–c; Table 22 on p. 327)
Diagnosis (averages are provided): Size in vivo about 115 × 27 µm; very elongate rectangular. Four
broadly ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and two ellipsoid micronuclei. Specific cortical granules
absent. On average three frontal cirri, two frontoterminal cirri, one buccal cirrus at level of begin
of paroral membrane, five frontoventral cirri of which four form two pairs, four transverse cirri, 26
cirri in right marginal row, 23 in left. Three dorsal kineties. Adoral zone indistinctly gonostomoid,
extends 35% of body length, composed of 27 membranelles. Buccal lip distinctly convex, paroral
and endoral membrane distinctly shifted; paroral composed of about 20 dikinetids.
Type locality: Soil from the floodplain of the Chobe River, Kabolebole Peninsula, Botswana,
25°S, 17°50'E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype and two paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides,
see Fig. 25a–f in Chapter 5.
Etymology: The Latin noun alveum refers to the habitat, viz., soil from the flood plain the
species was discovered.
Description: Afrogonostomum alveum is a rather stable species. Only seven out of 38 features
investigated have a CV >15%, and most of these are distances of low value for species recognition.
Size in vivo 90–140 × 20–35 µm, on average 115 × 27 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 22 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
slenderly (3.6:1) to very slenderly (5.3:1) rectangular, usually slightly narrower in posterior than
anterior third; dorsoventrally flattened about 2:1, posterior third distinctly thinner than anterior
third (Fig. 57a–c, 58a, b; Table 22). Usually four ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid macronuclear
nodules, forming an about 53 µm long row postorally and left of body’s midline; individual nodules
distinctly separate, forming indistinct pairs; average size 9 × 6 µm in protargol preparations, with
inconspicuous nucleoli impregnated very faintly. Usually two ellipsoid micronuclei 5 × 3 µm in vivo,
one each attached to anterior and posterior macronuclear pair (Fig. 57c, 58a; Table 22). Contractile
vacuole slightly anterior of mid-body, with two long collecting canals (Fig. 57a). Cortex flexible,
specific granules not detectable neither in vivo nor in protargol preparations. Cytoplasm colourless,
usually contains many food vacuoles 4–8 µm across in posterior half (Fig. 57a). Feeds on bacteria,
fungal hyphae, and heterotrophic flagellates. Swims and creeps rather fast.
1 Note by the editor (Helmut Berger): Gonostomum paronense was described by Bharti et al. (2015, p. 769) in a work
published in an online-only journal. Unfortunately, Bharti et al. (2015) have forgotten to register the work according
to ICZN (2012, Article 8.5.3; note that the registration – or at least a hint to the registration – must appear in the work
itself!). Thus, the new species (G. paronense) described in this work is not available, that is, invalid. Consequently, the
synonymy proposed by W. Foissner in the present work is valid (the question is if an invalid species can be synonymised
at all?). In 2017, a “corrigendum” (Corrigendum to “Two gonostomatid ciliates from the soil of Lombardia, Italy; in-
cluding note on the soil mapping project by Bharti et al”; J. Euk. Microbiol. 64, 907) has been published for Bharti et al.
(2015). However, this corrigendum is irrelevant because the registration in ZooBank has to be mentioned in the work
itself and the corrigendum itself cannot be considered as valid original description of G. paronense because it lacks all
other details for a valid description. For a valid correction of a similar mistake (Shao et al. 2014), see Shao et al. (2017).

specimen (from Stein 1859 and copied by Berger 1999). FT – frontoterminal cirri, PTC – pretransverse cirri, TC –
transverse cirri, III/2 – cirrus III/2. Scale bars 40 µm.
Cirri in Gonostomum affine pattern as described in Berger (1999, 2011) and Foissner et al. (2001);
fine and short compared to body size, frontoventral and some transverse cirri slightly thickened.
Three frontal cirri 15 µm long in vivo, followed by two frontoterminal cirri, cirrus III/2 left of
posterior frontoterminal cirrus; four frontoventral cirri in oral area, form two pairs; buccal cirrus
right of anterior end of paroral membrane; four transverse cirri only 3 µm distant from posterior
body end, thus cilia project distinctly from body proper; each composed of four or six about 15
µm long cilia; marginal cirral rows composed of 26 cirri (right row) and of 22 cirri (left row), each
made of four basal bodies with 10 µm long cilia, except of first right marginal cirrus composed of
six cilia; intercirral distances increase from anterior to posterior; marginal rows distinctly separate
posteriorly (Fig. 57a, b, 58a–c; Table 22).
Dorsal kinety pattern as typical for Gonostomum, i.e., three rows of bristles 2.5–3.0 µm long in
vivo (Berger 1999, 2011). Middle row composed of 16 dikinetids (Fig. 57c, 58b; Table 22).

of membranelles are gonostomoid (see Berger 1999, 2011). The numerals mark the frontal cirri. c: Dorsal posterior
half, showing the absence of caudal cirri because the last kinetids consist of two basal bodies indicating that they are

– endoral membrane, MA –macronucleus, MI – micronucleus, PF – pharyngeal fibres, PM – paroral membrane, TC –
transverse cirri. Scale bars 50 µm (a, b) and 25 µm (c).
Oral apparatus indistinctly gonostomoid, i.e., adoral zone of membranelles bends continuously
into the cell about 35% of body length, extends on anterior and left margin of body, on average
composed of 27 membranelles with, in vivo, up to 15 µm long cilia frontally; intermembranellar
distances slightly increase from posterior to anterior (Fig. 57a, b, 58a; Table 22). Buccal cavity in
vivo flat and narrow; buccal lip distinctly convex, i.e., about 7 µm wide on top of convexity, covers
proximal half of adoral zone (Fig. 57a, b). Paroral membrane slightly curved, near left margin of
buccal lip, short, i.e., composed of about 20 very narrowly spaced dikinetids with cilia about 8 µm
long in vivo. Endoral membrane straight, longer than paroral membrane, both distinctly shifted, i.e.,
project over end of endoral anteriorly by about half of its length while endoral projects over paroral
in posterior half. Pharyngeal fibres about 25 µm long, extend obliquely to mid-body.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality (see above). The species had low
abundance and was present only for 2 d.
Remarks: Afrogonostomum alveum is easily recognizable by the slender body, the four
macronuclear nodules, the sparse ciliature in the oral area, and the three rows of dorsal bristles.
However, most of these features are found in several genera, especially Hemisincirra Hemberger,

1985, e.g., H. namibiensis Foissner et al., 2002 which has, as A. alveum, a slender body, a similar size,
and four macronuclear nodules (for review, see Berger 2008).
I found two figures in the literature which could belong to Afrogonostomum. However, the first
is very likely a post-conjugate of Gonostomum affine that possibly lacks transverse cirri and has
an unknown number of macronuclear nodules (Fig. 57d). The second is probably a very slender
Gonostomum affine because it has two prominent pretransverse cirri and thus cannot be identical
with A. alveum. See Berger (1999, 2011) for reviews of the taxa mentioned.

Circinella filiformis australiensis nov. subspec.
(Fig. 59a–c, 60a–k; Table 23 on p. 328)
Diagnosis: Vermiform; on average 144 × 12 µm in protargol preparations and 166 × 14 µm
when 15% preparation shrinkage is added. On average a row of 10 globular to elongate ellipsoid,
distinctly separate macronuclear nodules and 137 right and left marginal cirri; usually, nine cirri in
frontoventral row 2. Adoral zone of membranelles extends about 9% of body length, composed of
an average of three frontal and seven ventral membranelles, and one membranelle in gap between
frontal and ventral membranelles.
Type locality: Australian site (30), i.e., upper soil and litter layer (0–5 cm) of a forest in the
Eubenangee Swamp National Park about 55 km south of the town of Cairns, 16°50'S, 145°E.

in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides,
see Fig. 26a–f in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered, i.e., Australia.
Description: In 1987, when I studied C. filiformis australiensis in vivo, I identified it as C.
filiformis because several main features were rather similar, e.g., body shape and size, the nuclear
apparatus, and the number of dorsal kineties and macronuclear nodules. Thus, I did not make live
illustrations. In 2017, when I studied the protargol slides, I recognized two distinct differences,
viz., the separate macronuclear nodules and the much higher number of marginal cirri, suggesting
subspecies rank (Table 23).
Some features of C. filiformis australiensis are highly variable (Table 23), viz., the number of
frontal cirri (0–3) and the number of frontoventral cirral rows (one or two). Most other features
have an ordinary variability (CV ≤15%) except of, e.g., the length:width ratio; the anterior body end
to the proximal end of frontoventral cirral row 2; the length, width, and number of macronuclear
nodules; the number and size of the micronuclei; the number of marginal cirri; and the number of
frontoventral cirral rows (usually two but short row 1 occasionally lacking).
The following description is based on the misidentification mentioned above and protargol-
impregnated specimens.
Size of protargol-impregnated specimens 130–210 × 11–17 µm, on average 166 × 14 µm when
15% preparation shrinkage is added (Table 23). Body very flexible; serpentine (Fig. 60a, h), rarely
rod-shaped (Fig. 59a, 2i), in ordinarily fed specimens slightly flattened laterally; well-fed and overfed
specimens about twice as wide as ordinary cells, more or less curved, rarely almost circular (Fig. 60f).
Anterior region slightly narrowed, end obliquely truncate (Fig. 59a, 60c–e, i–k); posterior region
gradually narrowed, posterior end narrowly rounded, bluntly pointed, or pointed (Fig. 59a, 60a,
f–i). On average 10 macronuclear nodules forming a single strand left of body midline, occupies
central fifths of cell, leaving free one fifth each anterior and posterior of strand (Fig. 59a, b, 60a,
f–i; Table 23). Nodules never connected, globular to very elongate ellipsoid, contain many minute
nucleoli. Usually, two bluntly ellipsoid or ellipsoid micronuclei one each attached to anterior and
posterior region of macronuclear strand (Fig. 59b, 60a, d; Table 23). Feds on bacteria digested
in vacuoles 3–5 µm across (Fig. 60a, b, i). Glides worm-like between soil particles, showing great
flexibility.
Data on somatic and oral infraciliature based on protargol-impregnated specimens for the
reasons mentioned above; some features difficult to interpret due to the narrowness of the cells.
All cirri composed of only two basal bodies with about 8 µm long cilia. Three, rarely only two or
no frontal cirri; cirrus 3 (= right frontal cirrus) rather far subapical at begin of frontoventral cirral
row 1, consisting of one or two cirri and thus extending only to mid-level of buccal cavity (Fig.

nodules. h: A specimen with incomplete oral apparatus and globular to ellipsoid macronuclear nodules separated from
each other. i, j: An ordinarily fed specimen in which the wide gap in the adoral zone is occupied by a single membranelle
so that a narrow gap is produced anterior and posterior of the membranelle (arrowheads).The macronuclear nodules
are distinctly apart and ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid. The arrow in (j) marks a long dorsal bristle. k: Ventral view of a
specimen with only one row of frontoventral cirri, very likely row 2. The arrowhead marks an adoral membranelle in the

59a, c, 60d, f; Table 23). Frontoventral cirral row 2 near right row of marginal cirri, composed of
6–12, on average of nine cirri and thus much longer than adoral zone of membranelles (Fig. 59a,
60b, d, k; Table 23). Identity of buccal cirrus questionable, i.e., could be the paroral or endoral
membrane. Right row of marginal cirri bipolar, left commences at level of proximal end of adoral
zone of membranelles and extends to posterior end of body; distance between cirri gradually slightly
increasing from anterior to posterior end of cell; postoral and transverse cirri lacking (Fig. 59a–c,
60a–d, f, g, i–k; Table 23).
On dorsal side, slightly left of body midline an average of 19 dikinetids producing a distinct,
bipolar row. Anterior basal body of dikinetids associated with an about 3 µm long bristle (Fig. 59b,
60c, e, j; Table 23).
Oral apparatus inconspicuous because extending only 9% of body length (Fig. 59a, c, 60a, f,
g, i; Table 23). Adoral zone of membranelles bipartite, i.e., composed of three, very rarely of four
frontal membranelles, 5–8 ventral membranelles, and one membranelle between frontal and ventral

membranelles, on average a total of 11 membranelles with largest bases 2–3 µm wide; individual
membranelles not composed of four ciliary rows, as usual, but of only three because row 3 is lacking
(Fig. 60d, inset; terminology, see Foissner & Al-Rasheid 2006), resembling the genus Etoschothrix
Foissner et al., 2002. Membranellar cilia up to 15 µm long. Buccal cavity minute and shallow,
identity of undulating membranes uncertain (see above); supposed endoral membrane about 3 µm
long. Pharyngeal fibres about 20 µm long (Fig. 59a, c, 60a–d, f, k; Table 23).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i.e., soil from a coastal swamp. The
slim body matches the sandy environment (Foissner 1987b).
Remarks: Circinella filiformis australiensis differs from the nominal subspecies, C. filiformis
filiformis (Foissner, 1982) Foissner, 1994, by two distinct features (Fig. 59d–f; Table 23): macronucleus
in several separate globules vs. moniliform; 137 vs. 94 right and left marginal cirri. Minor differences
are (Table 23): the larger body size and the size and site of the first macronuclear nodule.
The in vivo identification of this kind of hypotrichs is difficult because several congeners and
species from other genera have a similar shape and size, e.g., Circinella vettersi (Berger & Foissner,
1989) Foissner, 1994 (Fig. 59g–i), Periholosticha lanceolata Hemberger, 1985 (see also Foissner et al.
2002, p. 582); Engelmanniella mobilis (Engelmann, 1862) Foissner, 1982; Vermioxytricha arenicola
Foissner et al., 2002; Hemiurosoma terricola Foissner et al., 2002; Hemisincirra rariseta Foissner et
al., 2002; Australothrix fraterculus Foissner, 2016. All differ from Circinella filiformis australiensis
by the number of dorsal kineties (two at least, but kinety 2 is often very short and thus difficult to
recognize in vivo vs. one).
Urosoma australiensis nov. spec.
(Fig. 61a–e, 62a–h; Tables 24, 31 on p. 329, 337)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 200 × 60 µm. Ellipsoid with posterior half gradually narrowed.
Two widely separated, elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and an average of three globular
micronuclei. Cortical granules in loose rows, colourless, about 0.5 µm across; a reticular mitochondrial
layer underneath cortical granules. Buccal cirrus subapical of paroral membrane. Five transverse
cirri near posterior body end, last cirrus distinctly apart from penultimate cirri. Marginal cirral rows
extend to posterior body end, right row composed of an average of 43 cirri, left of 37; right row
commences with a dikinetid having associated a short bristle with the anterior basal body. Four
almost bipolar dorsal kineties associated with three caudal cirri. Adoral zone extends 27% of body
length on average, composed of about 36 membranelles; buccal cavity narrow and flat, lip narrow
and concave. Paroral and endoral membrane each about 15 µm long, half of posterior, respectively,
anterior portion side by side.
Type locality: Australian site (153), i.e., floodplain soil from a small river between the towns of
Alice Springs and Erldunda, central Australia, ~25°30'S, 133°E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype (Fig. 61d, e) and two paratype slides with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI). Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
For slides, see Fig. 27a–d in Chapter 5.
Etymology: The adjective australiensis (belonging to Australia) refers to the country the species
was discovered.
Description: Urosoma australiensis has an ordinary variability, i.e., most coefficients of variation
are ≤15% (Table 24). None of the features which have a higher variability is diagnostic, e.g., the
number of micronuclei (CV = 28.6%) and the distance from anterior body end to the right marginal
cirral row (CV = 22.9%).

PM – paroral membrane. Scale bars 50 µm.
Size in vivo 150–250 × 50–100 µm, usually about 200 × 60 µm. Difficult to preserve and
thus strongly shrunken (~50%) in protargol preparations (Table 24). Body basically ellipsoid but
gradually narrowed in posterior half with rear end about one third as wide as postoral region (Fig.
61a); narrowing usually also distinct in protargol preparations (Fig. 62b–e); laterally flattened up to
2:1, ventral side flat, dorsal more or less convex, depending on amount of food ingested (Fig. 61b).
Nuclear apparatus in central third of cell, nuclear figure about 60 µm long, consists of two (very
rarely three) macronuclear nodules and an average of three micronuclei (Fig. 61a, e, 62b–e; Table
24); nodules wide-spaced, usually elongate ellipsoid, rarely broadly ellipsoid, contain many minute,
globular nucleoli. Micronuclei attached to macronuclear nodules and scattered in central third of
cytoplasm, usually broadly, rarely slenderly ellipsoid, in vivo about 5 µm, in protargol preparations
about 4 × 3 µm. Contractile vacuole distinctly anterior of mid-body, with long, lacunar collecting
canals. Cortex flexible, fragile, contains widely spaced, colourless granules about 0.5 µm across;
underneath granular layer a conspicuous reticulum produced by discoidal mitochondria 2.0 × 1.5
µm in size (Fig. 61c, 62a). Cytoplasm opaque due to countless, colourless granules about 0.5 µm

across, producing a brownish appearance of anterior half of cell under bright field illumination; no
lipid droplets. Near posterior end usually a large defecation vacuole containing many small crystals
of irregular shape and 2–4 µm in size. Feeds on cysts of flagellates and very likely also on ciliates, as
indicated by the crystal vacuole. Swims and creeps rather rapidly.
Cirral pattern urosomoid, i.e., cirrus III/2 slightly anterior and left of frontoventral row,
usually slightly thickened (Fig. 61a, d, 62b–f; Table 24). Frontal cirri in vivo about 25 µm long
and moderately thickened; only two cirri in one out of 25 specimens investigated. Buccal cirrus
subapical of paroral membrane. Postoral cirri almost in line. Transverse cirri in hook-like pattern
and near to posterior body end, about 35 µm long in vivo and thus widely projecting from body
proper, fringed distally; last cirrus invariably apart from the others (Fig. 61d, 62d, g, h). Marginal
cirri in two rows, about 25 µm long in vivo, right row commences with a dikinetid of which the
anterior basal body bears a 3 µm long bristle; individual cirri composed of two ciliary rows.
Dorsal bristles 4 µm long in vivo, in four rows, row 1 commences subapically, the others bipolar.
Caudal cirri 25 µm long in vivo (Fig. 61a, e, 62e, g; Table 24).
Oral apparatus inconspicuous because extending only 22–32%, on average 27% of body length
both in vivo and in protargol preparations (Fig. 61a, d, 62b–e; Table 24). Adoral zone in Oxytricha
or indistinct Gonostomum pattern (Fig. 62d), composed of an average of 30 ordinary membranelles
with largest bases about 4 µm wide in protargol preparations. Buccal cavity short, shallow and
narrow compared to body size. Paroral and endoral membrane each only about 10 µm long, in
typical Urosoma pattern, i.e., posterior half of paroral side by side with anterior half of endoral;
paroral cilia in vivo 7 µm long. Buccal lip inconspicuous, concave. Pharyngeal fibres about 40 µm
long in protargol preparations.

Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. The big size and the habitat suggest
that Urosoma australiensis is more limnetic than edaphic. Possibly it develops in minute floodplain
puddles with much organic debris.

Foissner Wilhelm
Remarks: Urosoma australiensis has a considerable overall similarity with Paroxytricha
longigranulosa sinensis Foissner, 2016 (cirri in Urosoma vs. Oxytricha pattern); Urosomoida
reticulata Foissner et al., 2002 (cirri in Urosoma vs. Urosomoida pattern); and, specifically, Urosoma
gigantea (Horváth, 1933) Kahl, 1935, as redescribed by Berger & Foissner (1987). They differ by
the following features: (i) reticular vs. linear pattern of cortical mitochondria; (ii) posteriormost
transverse cirrus distinctly vs. ordinarily separated from other transverse cirri; (iii) right marginal
cirral row commences with a (dorsal?) bristle vs. an ordinary cirrus; (iv) adoral zone of membranelles
extends 27% vs. 37% of body length; (v) 36 vs. 47 adoral membranelles; and (vi) buccal lip concave
vs. angularly projecting. Minor differences: contractile vacuole with long vs. short collecting canals;
micronuclei 5 µm vs. 3 µm in vivo; buccal cirrus subapical vs. right of anterior end of paroral
membrane.

Urosoma pelobia nov. spec.
(Fig. 63a–c, 64a–q; Tables 24, 25 on p. 329, 331)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 155 × 25 µm. Very slender (~6:1) with posterior end narrowly rounded,
rarely bluntly acute, never emarginated. Two widely spaced, elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules
and an average of two large (7 × 3 µm), ellipsoid micronuclei. Distance between frontal cirri 2 and
3 usually twice as large as between 1 and 2. Buccal cirrus subapical of paroral membrane. Four
subterminal, fine transverse cirri distinctly projecting from body proper. Marginal rows extend to
posterior body end, right row composed of an average of 37 cirri, left of 33; right row commences
with a single dikinetid, the anterior basal body associated with a short bristle. Four dorsal kineties,
row 4 ends subterminally, i.e., at begin of tail-like narrowing. Adoral zone extends about 26% of
body length, composed of an average of 30 membranelles; buccal cavity narrow and flat. Paroral
and endoral membrane each about 10 µm long, half of posterior, respectively, anterior portion side
by side.
Type locality: Australian site (1/2006), i.e., floodplain soil from the Murray River near to the
town of Albury, waterside of Ryans road, Australia, 37°S, 147°E.
Type material: Three slides (one slide containing the holotype, two paratype slides) with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype (Fig. 63b, c) and other relevant specimens have been marked by
black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 28a–d in Chapter 5.
Etymology: pelobia is Greek and refers to the marshy floodplain habitat.
Description: Except of some distances, e.g., anterior body end to right marginal cirral row (CV
= 17.9%) and posterior body end to left marginal cirral row (CV = 45.7%), U. pelobia has a low to
ordinary variability (CV ≤10%, ≤15%).
Size in vivo about 155 × 25 µm, in protargol preparations 136 × 23 µm on average (Table 24).
Body slender (5:1) to very slender (7:1), on average 6:1 (Table 24); parallel-sided or slightly convex,
anterior end transversely cut off, posterior region distinctly narrowed especially the right margin,
rear end narrowly rounded to bluntly acute; never emarginated (checked in 50 specimens, Fig. 63a,
b, 64a, d, f, g–l, o, p); about 2:1 flattened laterally. Two ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid macronuclear
nodules in or near central third of body, usually distinctly apart; with many minute nucleoli. Usually
two, rarely three ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid micronuclei attached to macronuclear nodules at
various sites, comparatively large (7 × 3 µm in protargol preparations) and thus also conspicuous in
vivo (Fig. 63a–c, 64a, b, d, g, o; Table 24). Contractile vacuole slightly anterior of mid-body. Cortex
very flexible, possibly contains minute granules. Cytoplasm without peculiarities. Food vacuoles
up to 10 µm across, contain bacterial spores, small heterotrophic flagellates, and small resting cysts.
Swims and glides elegantly and rapidly on microscope slides.
Cirral pattern urosomoid, i.e., cirrus III/2 slightly anterior and left of frontoventral row (Fig.
63a, b, 64a–c, g, o). All cirri fine compared to body size (Fig. 63a–c, 64a, g–i, m–p). Frontal cirri
about 10 µm long in vivo and slightly thickened, cirrus 3 (= right frontal cirrus) usually distinctly
apart from cirri two and one (Fig. 63a, b, 64a–c, g, o, p). Buccal cirrus subapical of anterior end
of paroral membrane. Postoral cirri in line, first cirrus at level of proximal end of adoral zone of
membranelles. Four subterminal transverse cirri in hook-like pattern, in vivo about 15 µm long
and thus slightly projecting from body proper, thickened, last cirrus usually slightly apart from the
others. Pretransverse cirri minute, the posterior one at hook entrance. Marginal cirri fine, composed
of two minute ciliary rows, about 12 µm long in vivo, cirral distance highly variable in rear region;
right row commences with a dikinetid of which the anterior basal body has a 3 µm long bristle.
Dorsal bristles about 5 µm long in vivo; row 1 slightly shortened anteriorly and posteriorly; rows
2 and 3 almost bipolar, row 4 ends far subterminal, i.e., where body narrowing commences. Caudal

with anterior half of endoral membrane; form an acute angle because paroral more or less oblique.
Buccal lip inconspicuous. Pharyngeal fibres about 20 µm long in protargol preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. A second new species, → Urosoma
australiensis, occurred in floodplain soil from the red centre of Australia, about 1300 km southeast
of the type locality of U. pelobia. This shows not only intracontinental diversification but also our
ignorance of the ciliate fauna in general (see Berger 1999 and Foissner et al. 2002 for reviews and
post-Kahlian Urosoma species).
Remarks: There are four species which are similar to Urosoma pelobia (Table 25). Urosoma
macrostyla (Fig. 63d), as described by Wrześniowski (1870), is a small (120 × 30 µm vs. 155 × 25
µm), rather broad (length:width ratio 4:1 vs. 6:1) species with five thick (vs. four thin) transverse
cirri. Urosoma macrostyla (Fig. 63e), as described by Qin et al. (2011), is a misidentification (see
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 55–345 / 220

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
below). It has an acute (vs. narrowly rounded) posterior end, 41 (vs. 30) adoral membranelles, 48
(vs. 37) cirri in the right marginal row, and 42 (vs. 33) cirri in the left. Urosoma acuta Dragesco, 1972
and U. ambigua (Fig. 63f), as described by Dragesco & Dragesco-Kernéis (1986), have an acute (vs.
narrowly rounded) posterior end, 43 (vs. 30) adoral membranelles, five (vs. four) transverse cirri,
and about 50 (vs. 37 and 33) cirri each in the right and left marginal row (Table 25).
Berger (1999) synonymized U. acuta Dragesco, 1972 and U. ambigua Dragesco & Dragesco-
Kernéis, 1986 with U. macrostyla. I disagree because a life micrograph of Qin et al. (2011) shows
that species with a pronounced acute posterior end really exist. The Chinese species discovered by
Qin et al. (2011) differs from the African species described by Dragesco (1972) and Dragesco &
Dragesco-Kernéis (1986) mainly by body size (average length 226 µm vs. 120 µm and 150 µm),
indicating that they might be synonymous, especially when assumed that the huge body length of
the Chinese specimens results mainly from culture conditions.

deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). For slides, see Fig.
29a–d in Chapter 5.
Description: Except of some distances, e.g., posterior end to right marginal cirral row (CV =
42.5%); and the nuclear apparatus, e.g., the number of micronuclei (CV = 31.6%), H. similis has an
ordinary variability in all important features (CV ≤15%).
Size in vivo about 140 × 25 µm, as calculated from some in vivo measurements and the
morphometric data in Table 26 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body slender (5.8:1 on average)
to very slender (7:1) and lanceolate, i.e., rather abruptly narrowed posteriorly; rarely indistinctly
sigmoid. Anterior end transverse-truncate, posterior narrowly rounded. About 2:1 flattened
laterally (Fig. 65a–e, 66a, g, i, l; Table 26). Nuclear apparatus usually anterior of mid-body,
anterior nodule frequently partially covered by proximal third of adoral zone of membranelles
(Fig. 65a, e, 66a–c, i; Table 26). Macronuclear nodules in protargol preparations 13 × 5 µm on
average, i.e., ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid (>2.5:1); with many minute nucleoli. 1–4, on average
two ellipsoid micronuclei one each attached to macronuclear nodules; of ordinary size, i.e., 3 ×
1.5 µm in protargol preparations. Contractile vacuole slightly anterior of mid-body, with short,
lacunar collecting canals (Fig. 65a). Cortex very flexible, colourless, cortical granules in vivo not
recognizable in five specimens observed but minute, argyrophilic granules around cirri and dorsal
Fig. 64m–q. Urosoma pelobia, ventral views of morphostatic (m–p) and dividing (q) specimens. m, n: These specimens

inclusions (Fig. 65a, b): (i) many compact food vacuoles 5–10 µm across in posterior half of
body; (ii) 1–3 µm-sized crystals accumulated in rear end and as small clusters throughout body
making cells dark under bright field illumination; (iii) many lipid (?) arrays composed of 0.5–1.0
µm-sized, refractive droplets; and (iv) three, rarely four lithosomes in the pattern shown in Fig.

flagellates and possibly also on bacteria. Glides rapidly on microscope slides as well as between and
upon soil particles.
Somatic and oral infraciliature as described by Foissner (1982), i.e., in Urosoma pattern with
cirrus III/2 anterior and slightly left of frontoventral cirral row; postoral cirri absent (Fig. 65a, d, e,
66a–c, e–n; Table 26). Frontal cirri 10–12 µm long in vivo and slightly thickened; distance between
frontal cirri 2 and 3 distinctly increased, as in Austrian type (Foissner 1982). Usually two slightly
thickened transverse cirri very near to rear body end, about 15 µm long in vivo. Marginal cirri about
10 µm long in vivo, intracirral distances considerably enlarged in posterior region of rows.

Fig. 66i–n. Hemiurosoma similis, ventral (i, k, n) and dorsal (j, l, m) views of Botswanan specimens after protargol
impregnation. i: A typical specimen, showing the entire cirral pattern very clearly. j, k: Posterior body region, showing
the transverse cirri at end of cell. l, n: There are four dorsal kineties. Transverse cirri and caudal cirri are often difficult
to identify because the posterior end is very flat. m: Possibly, this specimen has only two caudal cirri. CC? – supposed
caudal cirrus, DAM – distalmost adoral membranelle, DK – dorsal kineties, F – fibres originating from transverse cirri,
FC – right frontal cirrus, TC – transverse cirri, III/2 – parabuccal cirrus, 1, 2, 3, 4 – dorsal kineties. Scale bars 10 µm (j,
m, n), 20 µm (k), 40 µm (l), 50 µm (i).
Invariably four dorsal kineties with 2 µm long bristles. Kinety 4 composed of an average of only
three dikinetids and thus ending anterior of mid-body. Caudal cirri close to rear body end, about 15
µm long in vivo (Fig. 65a, e, 66e, h, l–n; Table 26).
Oral apparatus inconspicuous because extending only 21% of body length on average, composed
of an average of 19 adoral membranelles only up to 5 µm wide in vivo (Fig. 65a, b, d, 66a–c, i;
Table 26). Frontal scutum 2–3 µm high. Buccal cavity very flat and narrow, lip distinctly convex
and up to 5 µm broad in vivo, bears paroral membrane composed of nine or 10 cilia 5 µm long
in vivo. Paroral and endoral membrane one after the other, both only 3–5 µm long in protargol
preparations. Pharyngeal fibres about 30 µm long.
Occurrence and ecology: Green river beds develop in the tropics during the dry season. The
river dries up and grass begins to grow in the bed area. The grass is used by many vertebrates, such

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
as rhinos, elephants and antelopes. Their faeces is an ideal fertilizer for the organism community,
including protists, when the river fills with water during the wet season. Although my experience
with this kind of habitat is rather limited, I know that its protist community is extremely divers and
contains hundreds, very likely even thousands of undescribed species.
The Botswanan record confirms the notion of Foissner (1998) that H. similis is a cosmopolitan
present in all main biogeographic regions except of Antarctica.
Remarks: The Botswanan specimens are highly similar to the Austrian ones except for the
presence/absence of lithosomes. However, I cannot exclude to have overlooked lithosomes in 1982
when I had much less experience than in 2004. Further, it is not known whether or not lithosomes
are a species-specific feature.
The morphometric comparison (Table 26) shows only minor differences in body size (on
average 140 × 25 µm vs. 130 × 20 µm), length:width ratio (5.8 vs. 6.6), and in the number of adoral
membranelles (19 vs. 22 on average).
Urosomoida uluruensis nov. spec.
(Fig. 67a–h, 68a–g; Table 27 on p. 333)
Diagnosis: Size about in vivo 90 × 25 µm; very elongate obovate (3.4:1). Two ellipsoid, narrowly
spaced (4 µm) macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. Cortical granules in loose rows
and around cirri and dorsal bristles, citrine to orange, 0.5–1.0 µm across. One buccal cirrus rather
distinctly posterior of anterior end of paroral membrane; distance between postoral cirri II and III
distinctly increased (5 µm); four transverse and pretransverse cirri. four dorsal kineties including one
dorsomarginal kinety, three caudal cirri. Adoral zone extends about 32% of body length, composed
of 24 membranelles on average. Buccal cavity moderately narrow and deep, buccal horn distinct.
Type locality: Australian site (170), i.e., ephemeral puddles on top of Uluru, Australia,
25°20'42''S, 131°02'10''E.
Type material: The slide1 containing the holotype (protargol method) and three paratype slides2
(protargol method) have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in
Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 24a–h in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Named after the site discovered, i.e., the aboriginal noun Uluru (English colonial
name: Ayers Rock) which is type locality.
Description: Urosomoida uluruensis is rather variable. Of the 41 characteristics investigated, 13
have a CV>15%, including two diagnostic features, viz., the distance between the macronuclear
nodules and the distance between postoral cirri II and III (Table 27).
Size in vivo 75–120 × 20–40 µm, usually about 90 × 25 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 27 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Usually
very elongate to elongate obovate, rarely elongate ellipsoid, never tail-like elongated posteriorly
(Fig. 67a, b, e, g, h, 68a–c, d, g). Nuclear apparatus in central third of cell left of bodies midline;
composed of two macronuclear nodules and two micronuclei on average, anterior nodule begins
at level of buccal vertex; nodules close together, on average 3.9 µm (CV = 52.5%!); ellipsoid to
broadly ellipsoid, in vivo about 15 × 10 µm; with distinct nucleoli (Fig. 67a, d, 68a–d, f, g; Table
27). Micronuclei usually in flat concavities of macronuclear nodules, about 3 × 2 µm in vivo and

in protargol preparations; number highly variable, two on average (Fig. 67a, d, 68c, Table 27).
Contractile vacuole slightly anterior of mid-body at left cell margin, with two lacunar collecting
canals (Fig. 67a, g). Cortex very flexible, distinctly contractile in anterior half of cell under mild
coverslip pressure. Cortical granules in rather loose rows and around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles,
citrine to orange making body yellowish at moderate magnification, 0.5–1.0 µm in diameter, do
not impregnate with the protargol method used (Fig. 67f). Cytoplasm colourless, studded with
ordinary crystals in posterior third of cell often in minute vacuoles, 2–4 µm long (Fig. 67a, c); lipid
droplets scattered throughout body, colourless, 1–8 µm in diameter (Fig. 67a). Feeds on bacteria
and spores of fungi 10–20 × 2–4 µm in size (Fig. 67a). Glides rapidly on microscope slides.
Most cirri 8–10 µm long in vivo, transverse cirri about 15 µm long; in Urosomoida pattern (Berger
1999); frontal and frontoventral cirri slightly thicker than postoral, transverse, and marginal cirri
extending to near posterior body end and thus often difficult to separate from transverse cirri and
caudal cirri (Fig. 67a, b, d, 68a–e, g). Buccal cirrus distinctly posterior of anterior end of paroral
membrane (Fig. 67a, b, 68a–d, g; Table 27). Distance between postoral cirri II and III much larger

than between I and II, i.e., 4.0 µm vs. 0.5 µm (Fig. 67a, b, 68b, g; Table 27). Usually four transverse
cirri, the upper rightmost very likely a pretransverse cirrus (Fig. 67a, b, 68a–d, g; Table 27). Marginal
cirri composed of two ciliary rows, cirral size slightly decreasing near posterior end of body (Fig. 67a,
b, 68a–d, g; Table 27). Caudal cirri close to posterior body end (Fig. 67a, b, d, 68a, d, e, g; Table 27).
Four dorsal kineties, row 4 extends only in anterior thirds of body and originates dorsomarginally;
rows 1–3 each with 8–11 kinetids having 2 µm long bristles (Fig. 67d, 68e, f; Table 27).
Oral apparatus as typical for genus, extends about 32% of body length, composed of 24 membranelles
on average with largest bases 8 µm long in vivo and 5 µm in protargol preparations. Buccal cavity
moderately narrow and deep, right margin appears thickened (Fig. 67a, b, 68a–d, g; Table 27); buccal
horn distinct; buccal lip moderately distinct, covers some proximal membranelles (Fig. 67a, b).
Undulating membranes slightly to rather distinctly curved, paroral optically covers anterior region
of endoral, paroral cilia in vivo about 5 µm long in anterior quarter, only 3 µm in posterior quarters.
Pharyngeal fibres distinct in protargol preparations (Fig. 67a, b, 68a–d, g; Table 27).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Became rather numerous in the
non-flooded Petri dish culture.

bars 20 µm.
Remarks: There are five Urosomoida s.l. species that have cortical granules: U. agilis (Engelmann,
1862) Hemberger, 1985, U. granulifera Foissner, 1996a, U. namibiensis Foissner et al., 2002, U.
galapagensis Foissner, 2016, and Paraurosomoida indiensis Singh & Kamra, 2015. See Berger (1999)
for authorship and revision of some species.
Urosomoida uluruensis is most similar to U. agilis but differs by the number of transverse and
pretransverse cirri (four vs. three); the large (vs. ordinary) distance between postoral cirri II and
III (as the Indian population of U. agilis studied by Singh & Kamra 2015); and the spacing of
the macronuclear nodules (only ~4 µm vs. one nodule space between the two nodules; such
macronuclear pattern occurs also in U. galapagensis, U. granulifera, U. agiliformis Foissner, 1982, U.
deserticola Foissner et al., 2002, and in U. halophila Foissner, 2016). Body length (around 90 µm vs.
120 µm) and shape (posterior end narrowly rounded vs. often tail-like elongated) are also slightly
different but too variable for a reliable distinction.

postoral portion usually cuneate because gradually narrowed posteriorly producing a narrowly
rounded or bluntly acute posterior end. Two ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid macronuclear nodules
connected by a fine thread and accompanied by an average of two globular micronuclei. Buccal cirrus
right of anterior end of paroral membrane; postoral cirri narrowly spaced, form a short, straight
line; two fine pretransverse and three terminal transverse cirri. Four dorsal kineties including one
dorsomarginal kinety; two laterally located caudal cirri. Adoral zone of membranelles extends about

Type locality: Mud from tank bromeliads on the Pico Isabel west of the town of Puerto Plata,
Dominican Republic, 19°N, 71°W.
Type material: Four slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the
Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype (Fig. 69c, d) and other
relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 30a–e
in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Bromelicola is a composite of the generic name Bromus (Bromeliaceae), the
thematic vowel ·i­, and the Latin verb colere (to live in), referring to the habitat the species was
discovered.
Description: Dry mud was collected from tanks of several bromeliads and treated with the non-
flooded Petri dish method (see method section).

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Urosomoida bromelicola has low variability, i.e., most features investigated have a CV<15%
(Table 28).
Size in vivo about 50–80 × 10–17 µm, usually about 65 × 15 µm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements (Table 29) and the morphometric data in Table 28 adding 15% preparation
shrinkage. Usually indistinctly pisciform or very elongate ellipsoid (length:width ratio 4.6:1 on
average), postoral portion cuneate because gradually narrowed posteriorly producing a narrowly
rounded or bluntly acute posterior end (Fig. 69a–c, 70a–j). Nuclear apparatus in central third
of cell left of body midline; composed of two macronuclear nodules and 1–4, on average two
micronuclei (Fig. 69a, d, 70a–f; Table 28). Macronuclear nodules ellipsoid to elongate ellipsoid,
distinctly separate but connected by a fine thread of argyrophilic material, on average 10.0 × 3.5 µm
in protargol preparations; contain many minute (≤0.5 µm) and some larger (up to 3 µm) nucleoli.
Micronuclei attached to various sites of macronucleus, inconspicuous both in vivo and protargol
preparations because only about 2.0 × 1.5 µm in size. Contractile vacuole in or slightly anterior
of mid-body at left margin of cell, frequently between macronuclear nodules; without distinct
collecting canals (Fig. 69a). Cortex flexible, without specific granules in vivo and in protargol
preparations. Cytoplasm conspicuously hyaline, colourless, contains some 2–4 µm-sized crystals
and some ellipsoid or globular lipid droplets up to 4 µm across, occur mainly in posterior third of
cell. Food vacuoles 4–6 µm in diameter, usually hyaline because containing only few fine bacterial
rods up to 6 µm long, rarely compact (Fig. 69a, 70b, c).
Cirral pattern and number as typical for Urosomoida (for reviews, see Berger 1999 and Foissner
2016); i.e., not 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri but only 16 because two transverse cirri are lacking
(Fig. 69a, c, 70a–j; Table 28). Three, rarely only two frontal cirri, cirrus III more widely separate
from cirrus II than cirrus I from II. Four frontoventral cirri forming a short row near right margin
of cell, cirrus III/2 close to cirrus IV/3, i.e., to middle cirrus of row. Buccal cirrus right or slightly
posterior of anterior end of paroral membrane. Postoral cirri close together, forming a short, straight
row. Pretransverse cirri close to transverse cirri, fine possibly consisting of only two cilia. Transverse
cirri at posterior end of body, each consisting of four cilia about 10 µm long in vivo. Pretransverse,
transverse, and caudal cirri form a rather conspicuous bush at end of cell. Marginal cirri about 8
µm long in vivo, distances between cirri gradually increase in posterior third of cell while cirral
size decreases. Two caudal cirri at left margin of posterior end of cell, each composed of four cilia
about 12 µm long (Fig. 69a, d, 70g, j). Four dorsal kineties composed of comparatively widely
spaced dikinetids each associated with an about 2 µm long bristle. Kineties 1 and 2 commence
far subapically and end close to the caudal cirri, composed of an average of six and eight bristles,
respectively; row 3 commences subapically and ends far subterminally, composed of an average of
six bristles; row 4 commences subapically and ends in anterior third of cell, composed of an average
of four bristles, originates dorsomarginally (Fig. 69d, 70b; Table 28).
Oral apparatus as typical for genus, inconspicuous because extending only about 27% of body
length, on average composed of 16 ordinary membranelles with largest bases only 3–4 µm long
in vivo and in protargol preparations; adoral zone of membranelles continuous, i.e., not bipartite
(Fig. 69a, c, 70a–f; Table 28). Buccal cavity in vivo only 1–2 µm wide but rather deep; buccal lip

features of this species are the narrowly rounded (c–e, h–j) to bluntly pointed (a, b, f, g) posterior end and the terminal
location of the transverse cirri (a, c–i). The arrows in (c, f) mark a thread connecting the macronuclear nodules. Note

Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Became moderately abundant in
the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Remarks: This small species lives in a specific habitat, viz. tank bromeliads, and identification
requires careful live observation and protargol preparation. The most important features of U.
bromelicola are body shape (slender, posterior end narrowly rounded or bluntly acute), the number
(two) of pretransverse cirri, and the number (three) and location (terminal) of the transverse cirri.
See Table 29 of this monograph and Table 2 in Wang et al. (2016) for detailed comparisons with
similar species, especially congeners some of which are now classified in different genera (Foissner
2016).
Bothrigidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Dorsomarginalian hypotrichs with an ontogenetic primordium each for the oral
apparatus (between buccal vertex and transverse cirri) and for the ventral cirri between right row of
marginal cirri and ventral cirral rows.
Type genus: Bothrix nov. gen.
Further genera assignable: None, except of the type but ontogenetic data are still rare. Thus,
further genera might exist.
Remarks: This is an outstanding ciliate well appropriate to serve as a representative of a new
family. As yet, no hypotrich has been described having the diagnostic feature described. All other
oxytrichids and hypotrichs generally have only one primordium, i.e., that between buccal vertex
and transverse cirri (for reviews, see Berger 1999, 2006, 2008, 2011; Chen et al. 2017; Song & Shao
2017). However, there is a great number of ontogenetic patterns some resembling that of Bothrix
africana, e.g., Pseudoamphisiella Song, 1996, Paraurostyla Borror, 1972; and often transverse cirri
are absent and ventral cirral rows produce new cirri without an extra primordium (Berger 1999;
Song & Shao 2017).
Very likely, there is some relationship to the genus Territricha Berger & Foissner, 1988, viz., the
zigzagging cirri of the ventral rows and the genesis of dorsal kinety 4 by a posterior split of kinety 3.
This applies also to the genus Apoterritricha Kim et al., 2014 which belongs to the Neokeronopsidae
Foissner & Stoeck, 2008, according to molecular data (Kim et al. 2014).
Bothrix nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Bothrigidae with semirigid cortex and zigzagging cirri in two ventral rows; buccal
cirrus composed of individualized kineties; postoral cirri absent. Paroral membrane composed of
zigzagging dikinetids in anterior half and of a membranoid structure in posterior half. Most dorsal
kineties develop de novo.
Type species: Bothrix africana nov. spec.
Etymology: The genus name is a composite of Bo (Botswana where the genus was discovered)
and the Greek noun thrix (hair ~ ciliate). Feminine gender.
Species assignable: Bothrix africana nov. spec.
Remarks: Half of the generic diagnostics are unique, viz., the structure of the buccal cirrus and
of the paroral membrane. Very likely, both are apomorphies, i.e., developed in a longly undisturbed

(arrowhead), showing that they are “primary primordia”. The streak of basal bodies (arrows) increase in size and will
produce the undulating membranes. In the proter, the parental undulating membrane produces a circular, anarchic
field of basal bodies which will become the first frontal cirrus (Fig. 73f). The micronuclei (MI) are now much larger

posterior third (Fig. 71a–c, 72e, f, i, j, l, n, p–r, t, v, w, 74a; Table 30). Paroral membrane longer than
endoral membrane anteriorly, ends far away from buccal vertex, rather distinctly curved, bipartite,
i.e., anterior half composed of zigzagging dikinetids, very likely covered by frontal cortex; posterior
half extends to mid of buccal cavity, composed of minute, oblique kineties with three basal bodies
each, proximal portion turned by about 180°. Endoral membrane curved, commences posterior
of paroral and extends to buccal vertex. Pharyngeal fibres extend slightly obliquely to mid-body,
usually faintly impregnated (Fig. 71a–c, 72r, v, w; Table 30).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. Can make resting cysts (unfortunately
not studied) because the soil was dry when collected. This was a very rich sample containing about
100 species many of which were undescribed. Very likely, hundreds of further species exist in the
flood plain and in the “green river bed”.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Remarks: This species is easily recognizable by the long dorsal bristles; the long, acute cirri;
the small oral opening; the body size; and the nuclear apparatus. Although there are rather many
hypotrichs with long dorsal bristles, most are smaller than 100 µm and have only one micronucleus
in between the macronuclear nodules (for reviews, see Berger 1999 and Kahl 1932). I could not find
a described ciliate with the key features of Bothrix africana.
Ontogenesis: The protargol preparations contain sufficient dividers to follow the process.
Bothrix is unique in that there are two primordia, one for the oral apparatus and another for most
frontoventral cirri. However, basically it is an oxytrichid ontogenesis, especially on the dorsal side
(Fig. 73k, l).
Oral primordium: A long anarchic field of basal bodies develops between mid-body and the
upper left transverse cirri (Fig. 73b–d). Concomitantly, a very narrow streak of basal bodies
projects from the right margin of the oral primordium and extends to the buccal vertex. Further,
a club-shaped anlage I is generated in the proter, very likely by the anterior half of the undulating
membranes and perhaps also by the streak of basal bodies of the opisthe oral primordium (Fig. 73c,
d). Later, an anlage for new undulating membranes is recognizable in proter and opisthe (Fig. 73e,
f, h). Concomitantly, new adoral membranelles are generated in the oral primordium of the opisthe
while the parental adoral zone of membranelles is completely maintained (Fig. 73c–f, h). Further,
a new frontal cirrus 1 is produced by the club-shaped anarchic field of basal bodies in the proter
and by the anlage for the undulating membranes in the opisthe (Fig. 73e, f, h). When the cirri are
migrating, new undulating membranes are recognizable in proter and opisthe (Fig. 73i).
Cirral primordium: This develops slightly anterior of mid-body between the right row of marginal
cirri and the right row of ventral cirri (Fig. 73b). Soon, eight or nine long cirral anlagen streaks develop
in the proter (Fig. 73c, d). These long streaks are primary primordia that divide in the mid: the anterior
half develops to proter cirri, the posterior half produces the opisthe cirri (Fig. 73e, f). Next, cirri
develop in the anlagen streaks (Fig. 73b) which then migrate to the species-specific sites (Fig. 73i).
Marginal cirri and nuclear apparatus: When the cirral anlagen have been divided, four anlagen are
generated for new marginal cirral rows (Fig. 73e, f). Next, the dorsomarginal kineties are produced
in the anlagen for the right marginal cirral row (Fig. 73h, i). Nuclear division commences after the
production of dorsomarginal kineties (Fig. 73h–j). All these processes are highly similar to those
occurring in typical oxytrichids (for a review, see Berger 1999).
Dorsal infraciliature: In most oxytrichids and in the type species Oxytricha granulifera Foissner &
Adam, 1983 the dorsal bristle rows (kineties) originate within the parental kineties (for a review, see
Berger 1999). In Bothrix, most dorsal kineties develop de novo, i.e., distinctly right of the parental
kineties (Fig. 73g, j). In contrast, bristle row 4 is produced as in typical oxytrichids, viz., by terminal
segregation of row 3 (Fig. 73j). Caudal cirri develop at posterior end of kineties 1, 2, 4 (Fig. 73j).
Physiological reorganization: Three stages were found. First, the proximal, upright portion of the
adoral zone of membranelles is resorbed (Fig. 74a, d, e). Then, anlagen are produced for new rows of
marginal cirri, the buccal cirrus is resorbed, and eight cirral anlagen streaks are generated. Further,
an anarchic field of basal bodies appears in the proximal region of the adoral zone of membranelles
(Fig. 74f, g). Dorsally, three new kineties develop right of the parental rows (Fig. 74h) and parental
cirri are resorbed ventrally (Fig. 74f, g).
Mixophrya nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Large (length usually >150 µm), flexible Oxytrichidae with Oxytricha cirral pattern
(18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri) and urosomoid dorsal ciliature. Cortex likely semirigid. Oral
apparatus stylonychid in vivo, i.e., with short and flat buccal cavity and short undulating membranes

in Oxytricha pattern; adoral zone of membranelles indistinctly gonostomatid, membranelles
narrow compared to body size, i.e., about 12% of body width. Dorsal kineties 1–3 divide without
fragmentation; kineties 4–7 originate dorsomarginally. Wall of resting cyst smooth, covered by a
voluminous slime formation.
Type species: Mixophrya pantanalensis nov. spec.
Etymology: Mixophrya is a composite of the Greek noun mix (mingled) and ophrya (eyebrow ~
cilia ~ ciliate s.l.) meaning a ciliate group comprising features from two genera, viz., Oxytricha and
Urosoma. Feminine gender.
Species assignable: Mixophrya pantanalensis nov. spec. with two subspecies, namely, Mixophrya
pantanalensis pantanalensis nov. sspec.; → Mixophrya pantanalensis australiensis nov. ssp.; Mixophrya
gigantea (Horváth, 1933) nov. comb. (original combination: Oxytricha gigantea Horváth, 1933, as
redescribed by Berger & Foissner 1987).
Possibly, several large Oxytricha species belong to Mixophrya, e.g., Oxytricha longissima Dragesco
& Njine, 1971 and Oxytricha fallax Stein, 1859.

after protargol impregnation. c: Overview of a mid-divider,
showing segregation of cirri in the six fronto-ventral-transversal
cirral anlagen each in proter and opisthe as well as four anlagen
for the new marginal cirral rows. Further, three anlagen (1–3) for dorsomarginal kineties are recognizable. d: Opisthe
of a late mid-divider, showing cirral migration, the separating undulating membranes, the almost finished adoral zone of

Cirri are generated in the anlagen for the new marginal rows in proter and opisthe. A – anlagen, AFT – anlagen for
the fronto-ventral-transversal cirri, AZM – adoral zone of membranelles, BC – buccal cirrus, F – fibres, FC1 – frontal
cirrus 1, FV – food vacuoles, FVC – frontoventral cirri, PM + EM – anlage for the undulating membranes, i.e., paroral
and endoral membrane, TC – new transverse cirri. Scale bars 50 µm.
Remarks: Most flexible Oxytricha species are medium-sized, i.e., are smaller than 130 × 40 µm
in protargol preparations. Here, I report on some large (in vivo up to 370 × 115 µm on average)
oxytrichids from Australia, Brazil, and tank bromeliads in Mexico. The main characteristics of these
species are compared in Table 31.
The new genus Mixophrya has an Oxytricha cirral pattern while the dorsal bristles are arranged
as in Urosoma. This is shown by ontogenetic data (Fig. 75a–d, f, 78h–k, m): there are six cirral
anlagen that produce 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri, and the posterior postoral cirrus does
not form an anlage, as in Stylonychia (Fig. 78i, j). Further stylonychid features are the rather rigid
cortex, the flat and rather narrow buccal cavity, and an indistinct frontal plate due to the short
undulating membranes. The dorsal bristle pattern is as simple as in the oxytrichid Urosoma, i.e.,

kinety fragmentation is absent. This curious mixture of oxytrichid and stylonychid features justifies
the new genus Mixophrya.1

(Fig. 75a–f, 76a–i, 77a–u, 78a–m, 79a–e, 80a–n; Tables 31, 32 on p. 337)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 370 × 115 µm or 280 × 80 µm. Body usually broadly clavate. Two
distinctly separated elongate ellipsoid or ellipsoid macronuclear nodules and an average of four
or three globular micronuclei. Cortical granules in loose rows, sharp-yellowish or bright-citrine,
0.2–0.3 µm across. Cytoplasm with an average of six conspicuous lithosomes 6–11 µm across, or
lithosomes absent. Buccal cirrus distinctly subapical or subapical of paroral membrane. Five thickened
transverse cirri about 37 µm or 30 µm anterior of posterior body end; two fine pretransverse cirri.
1 Note by H. Berger: W. Foissner found a similar species, likely belonging to Mixophrya, in Botswana. According to my
terminology, species without kinety 4 fragmentation do not belong to the oxytrichids (see Berger 2008, p. 46).

Type material: The slide containing the holotype and four paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
in Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on
the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 32a–f in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Named after the area found, i.e., the Pantanal, a famous wetland.
Description: Mixophrya pantanalensis pantanalensis is difficult to preserve. Good results were
obtained with the fixative of Foissner & Dragesco (1996), followed by protargol impregnation with
Wilbert’s (1975) method.
The preparations are from specimens cultivated in Eau de Volvic, some milliliters from the non-
flooded Petri dish culture, and some cracked wheat grains.

Mixophrya pantanalensis pantanalensis is moderately variable, i.e., 13 out of 45 features
investigated have a coefficient of variation of >15%. However, most of these concern features not
used in the diagnosis, such as distances, size of macronuclear nodules and micronuclei. The number
of micronuclei and the size and number of lithosomes are highly variable.
Size in vivo 250–350 × 80–100 µm, on average 292 × 110 µm (n = 6, non-flooded Petri dish
culture). Cultivated, protargol-impregnated specimens 315–412 × 94–135 µm, on average 370
× 115 µm (including 15% preparation shrinkage; Table 32). Body bluntly clavate, i.e., gradually
narrowed in posterior half; rarely elongate ellipsoid, posterior region sometimes slightly head-
like; laterally flattened about 2:1, ventral side flat, dorsal more or less convex in middle third,
depending on amount of food ingested (Fig. 76a, c, d, g–i, 77a, b, q). Nuclear apparatus in central
third of body (Fig. 76a, e; Table 32). Macronuclear nodules widely separate, anterior nodule usually
covered by proximal portion of oral apparatus; about 50 × 25 µm in vivo and on average 40 × 18
µm after protargol preparation, i.e., usually ellipsoid, rarely bluntly or elongate ellipsoid; contain
many nucleoli 1–3 µm across. 2–10, on average four globular micronuclei attached or near to
macronuclear nodules, 5–6 µm in vivo, 4.7 µm on average in protargol preparations. Contractile
vacuole in mid-body, with short collecting canals (Fig. 76a, i, 77j). Cortex of specimens from
non-flooded Petri dish culture likely semirigid, i.e., does not show flexibility or contractility when
swimming or crawling while specimens from semipure culture are soft and flexible. Cortical granules
in loose rows, about 0.2 µm across, sharp-yellowish (Fig. 76b, 77d–g, 78l); a second type of cortical
granules(?), seen only in protargol preparations, is about 2.0 × 1.5 µm in size and quite similar to
those described in → Mixophrya pantanalensis australiensis. Mitochondria reniform, 2–3 µm long,
produce a conspicuous reticulum close underneath the cortical granules (Fig. 77c). Cytoplasm
strongly vacuolated, colourless, contains three remarkable structures: (i) food vacuoles up to 50 µm
across; (ii) an average of six scattered lithosomes with a size of 6–11 µm, on average 8.4 µm; and
(iii) in posterior body half black, flat, angular structures 3–10 µm in size, do not solve when cell
is squashed (Fig. 76a, 77a, b, j, k–p; Table 32). Omnivorous, feeds on a 170 µm long, green, stick-
shaped euglenoid (Astasia?), fungal hyphae, heterotrophic flagellates, various middle-sized ciliates
(Vorticella, Colpoda), testate amoebae (Euglypha, Arcella), starch grains from the food added, and
even rotifers (Fig. 76a, 77a, b, j–l).
Somatic and oral infraciliature highly similar to that described for → M. pantanalensis australiensis,
both morphologically and morphometrically. Thus, I refer the reader to the description of → M.
pantanalensis australiensis and to Fig. 76a, d, e, 77h, i, q–u, 78a, b, g; Tables 31, 32.
Resting cyst: Resting cysts globular, with wall on average 70 µm across, with wall and slime cover
on average 145 × 128 µm (Table 32). Cyst wall smooth, light brown, 2–3 µm thick, surrounded by a
voluminous, yellowish slime cover the internal region of which is more compact and remains on the
wall when the cyst is squashed. Macronuclear nodules not fused, plasm studded with 1–5 µm-sized
lipid droplets and brown food remnants (Fig. 76f, 78c–f; Table 32).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i.e., in the soil-water transition zone
of a lagoon in the Pantanal of Brazil. Grows well in laboratory cultures (see begin of description).
Size, shape and locality suggest that M. pantanalensis pantanalensis is a limnetic species.
Remarks: See → Mixophrya pantanalensis australiensis.

Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and other relevant specimens have been marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 33a–g in Chapter 5.
Etymology: The adjective australiensis (belonging to Australia) refers to the country the species
was discovered.
Description: Mixophrya pantanalensis australiensis is difficult to preserve. Useable protargol
slides were obtained when they were fixed in Stiev’s fluid enriched with osmium tetroxide (2% in
water) and impregnated with Wilbert’s method (Wilbert 1975). Possibly, pure ethanol (70–90%)
will give also good results.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Mixophrya pantanalensis australiensis has an ordinary variability, i.e., most diagnostic features
have a CV≤15% (Table 32). Higher coefficients of variation occur mainly in distances (e.g., anterior
body end to right marginal cirral row, posterior body end to right and left marginal cirral row), rarely
in sizes and numbers (e.g., size and number of micronuclei, number of bristles in dorsal kineties 5
and 6).
Size in vivo about 200–330 × 70–90 µm, usually about 280 × 80 µm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data in Table 32 adding 15% length shrinkage while
nothing is added to body width due to the fixation problems; specimens from non-flooded Petri
dish culture smaller by about one third than those from pure culture. Body bluntly clavate, i.e.,
gradually narrowed in posterior half; rarely elongate ellipsoid; laterally flattened about 2:1, ventral
side flat, dorsal more or less convex in middle third, depending on amount of food ingested; hungry
specimens hyaline in posterior region (Fig. 79a, b, d, 80a–i). Nuclear apparatus in central third of
cell (Fig. 79a, e, 80h, i; Table 32). Macronuclear nodules widely separate, anterior nodule usually
covered by proximal portion of oral apparatus; elongate ellipsoid, rarely ellipsoid; contain many
nucleoli 1–10 µm across and a quarter of specimens contains some ring-shaped structures 10–20
µm in size. Usually three globular to broadly ellipsoid micronuclei attached or near to macronuclear
nodules. Contractile vacuole distinctly anterior of mid-body, with short collecting canals (Fig. 79a,
80a, b, d, e, g). Cortex very flexible, cells slightly contractile under mild coverslip pressure. Cortical
granules in loose rows, bright-citrine, only 0.2 µm across (Fig. 79c); a second type of cortical granules
(?), seen only in protargol preparations (Fig. 80j, l), is about 2.0 × 1.5 µm in size and is probably a
special kind of mitochondria which form a dense, subcortical layer (Fig. 79c). Cytoplasm usually
studded with food vacuoles and countless, pale globules about 1 µm across, provide cells with a
blackish or brownish colour under transmitted light and low magnification (≤×100); some about 2
µm-sized crystals scattered throughout body. In the non-flooded Petri dish culture, M. pantanalensis
australiensis feeds only on a highly metabolic Peranema species strongly moving in the food vacuole
for some time (Fig. 79a). In raw cultures, feeds on Polytoma sp., Tetrahymena mobilis, rarely on
Paramecium aurelia, and on up to 30 µm-sized starch grains. Swims slowly, never stands still.
Somatic ciliature in Oxytricha pattern (Fig. 79a, d, 80h, i, k, m, n; Table 32). Frontal cirri
thickened, in vivo about 30 µm long, rightmost very near to first adoral membranelle (Fig. 80k,
m). Buccal cirrus rather far posterior of anterior end of paroral membrane. Four frontoventral cirri,
cirrus III/2 anterior to buccal cirrus and associated with four short, thick fibres anchoring it to the
cortex (Fig. 80h, i, m, n); similar fibres very likely associated with frontal cirri. Postoral cirri in vivo
about 30 µm long, anterior cirri close together posterior of buccal vertex, third cirrus far posteriorly,
i.e., in or near mid-body. Transverse cirri thickened, rather far subterminal, in vivo 30–40 µm long,
do not or only slightly project from body proper, distal end fringed; pretransverse cirri very fine
compared to size of cell. Marginal cirri about 25 µm long in vivo, each composed of three rows of
basal bodies (Fig. 79a, d, 80h, i, k, m, n; Table 32).
Six dorsal kineties with bristles 4–5 µm long in vivo and in protargol preparations (Fig. 79e;
Table 32). Kinety 1 begins far subapical; kineties 1–4 extend to posterior body end; kinety 5 slightly
shortened posteriorly; kinety 6 ends slightly anterior or posterior of mid-body. Three dividers
show activity only in kineties 1–3 each producing a thin caudal cirrus; kineties 4–6 originate
dorsomarginally.
Oral apparatus in Oxytricha (optically crossing undulating membranes) or in vague Stylonychia
(undulating membranes short, buccal cavity flat and rather narrow, with rather distinct frontal
plate) pattern, extends about 35% of body length, composed of about 50 membranelles the largest
of which only 12 µm wide in vivo and 9 µm in protargol preparations (Fig. 79a, d, 80h, i; Table
32). Frontal scutum high and thus well recognizable in micrographs (Fig. 80a–d, f). Frontal plate
comparatively distinct because undulating membranes begin far posteriorly of anterior body end.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality. The big size suggests Mixophrya
pantanalensis australiensis as a limnetic litter species.
Remarks: Of the taxa compared in Table 31, Mixophrya pantanalensis pantanalensis is most
similar to M. pantanalensis australiensis. They differ in body size (319 µm vs. 247 µm on average in
protargol preparations), the location of the transverse cirri (32 µm vs. 26 µm distant from body end,
both about 10% of body length), and the presence vs. absence of lithosomes.
Of the species found in the literature (for a review, see Berger 1999), the African Oxytricha
longissima Dragesco & Njine, 1971 is rather similar to M. pantanalensis australiensis, differing by
the length of the macronuclear nodules (26 µm vs. 40 µm), the number of adoral membranelles (37
vs. 52), the undulating membranes (paroral and endoral same length vs. paroral distinctly shorter
than endoral), and the number of dorsal kineties (5 vs. 6). I suggest to reinvestigate the Cameroon
species to get better data, for instance, on body shape, cortical granules, and the number of adoral
membranelles which is, according to Berger (1999), not 37 but 46 in the figure provided by Dragesco
& Njine (1971). This applies also to the North American O. elongata (Smith, 1897) Kahl, 1932 of
which only body shape and size are useable and match M. pantanalensis australiensis.
Conotrichidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Dorsomarginalian oxytrichids with unique dorsal ciliature, i.e., long (ordinary) bristle
rows each producing “short” rows by growth and terminal segregation in all long kineties; each
rightmost short row generates a caudal cirrus. A minute dorsomarginal kinety on ventral side of right
anterior quadrant of cell, originates de novo and produces also the right row of marginal cirri. Oral
apparatus psilotrichid. Opisthe’s adoral zone of membranelles horizontally oriented in late dividers.
Type genus: Conothrix nov. gen.
Genera assignable: Conothrix nov. gen.
Remarks: The diagnostic morphological and ontogenetic features are unique and suggest family
rank for the single species, Conothrix australiensis. This is supported by the bewildering generic
characteristics, which occur in various ciliates but not in the combination found in Conothrix,
indicating a high number of homoplasies. Conothrix shows mainly features characteristic for typical
oxytrichids and the curious oxytrichid Psilotrichidae reviewed by Heber et al. (2014, 2018). Both
are presently supported mainly by morphological and ontogenetic characteristics. An oxytrichid
relationship is indicated by the morphology and ontogeny of the dorsal infraciliature and the 18S
rRNA of Urospinula (Heber et al. 2014). Indeed, the dorsal kinety pattern of Conothrix resembles
that of typical oxytrichids where (usually) the long kinety 3 produces one or more “short” kineties
possibly using the same or a very similar process as Conothrix (for a review, see Berger 1999). A
rather close relationship of conotrichids and psilotrichids is obvious by the very similar morphology
and ontogeny of the highly specific oral apparatus (Foissner 1983b; Heber et al. 2014).
Nonetheless, there is some probability that Conothrix belongs to the Psilotrichidae, as re-defined
by Heber et al. (2014, 2018). However, psilotrichids lack frontal and buccal cirri. Further, they have
a quite different dorsal ciliature, i.e., they lack “short” kineties and the “caudal” cirrus is made by the
last cirrus of the left marginal row (Fig. 81g).

Remarks: Most generic characters occur also in other ciliates but not in the combination found
in Conothrix. A lack of transverse cirri is rather widespread in oxytrichids and, e.g., psilotrichids
(Berger 1999; Heber et al. 2014, 2018). A frontal plate is typical for stylonychid oxytrichids
(Berger 1999; Kumar & Foissner 2017) and the curious Rigidothrix Foissner & Stoeck, 2006. A
conspicuously thickened left margin of the buccal roof is typical for psilotrichids (Heber et al.
2014, 2018; Foissner unpubl.). The low number of cirral anlagen is likely connected with the low
number of cirri in Conothrix while typical oxytrichids usually have six but only five occur, e.g., in
Fig. 82u–w. Conothrix australiensis, ventral and dorsal view in the scanning electron microscope. The caudal cirri of
the left specimen are only partially preserved. Note the conspicuous frontal plate, resembling Stylonychia, and the small
buccal cavity. The right specimen shows three distinct dorsal kineties which begin far subapically; the arrow marks a
single bristle possibly belonging to one of the “short” dorsal kineties usually not recognizable in the SEM for unknown
reasons. The slightly curved slit is very likely the opening for the contractile vacuole (v, w). AZM – adoral zone of

Vermioxytricha and Erimophrya (Foissner et al. 2002). The oral primordium develops in a more
or less deep pouch in psilotrichids (Heber et al. 2014), euplotids (Wise 1965), and oligotrichs
(Foissner et al. 1999; Petz & Foissner 1993). The genesis of the proter paroral membrane is as yet
unique but resembles the nassulids (Foissner 1996c).

micronucleus 6–10 µm across in vivo. Contractile vacuole in mid-region, with slit-like opening.
Cortex flexible, without specific granules. Swimming resembles oligotrichs. Ventral cirral pattern
very sparse, i.e., composed of three frontal cirri, one buccal cirrus and three inconspicuous pairs of
ventral cirri, right marginal row composed of four cirri, left of three; dorsomarginal kinety composed
of three bristles. Three ordinary rows of dorsal bristles commencing about 20 µm subapically, each
accompanied by two “short” bristle rows, each rightmost “short” row produces a caudal cirrus,
forming together a conspicuous, about 20 µm long “caudal cirrus” on top of posterior body end.
Oral apparatus conspicuous because extending about 40% of body length and membranellar cilia
up to 35 µm long in vivo. Adoral zone composed of about 10 membranelles, anteriorly curved to
midline of body. Undulating membranes slightly curved and side by side.
Type locality: Australian site (106?), i.e., flood plain soil from Murray River near to the town of
Albury, waterside of Ryans road, Australia, 37°S, 147°E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype and four paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 55–345 / 268

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
in Linz (LI). The holotype, the ontogenetic stages, and other relevant specimens have been marked
by black ink circles on the coverslip.1 For slides, see Fig. 9a–g, 34a–f in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Named after the continent found, i.e., Australia.
Description of morphostatic cells: Several ciliated structures present in protargol preparations
are not recognizable in the scanning electron microscope, viz., the buccal cirrus, the dorsomarginal
kinety, and the “short” dorsal kineties. I do not have an explanation.
The variability is rather high, i.e., 17 out of 39 features have a CV>15% (Table 33). Size in vivo
70–115 × 35–50 µm, usually about 90 × 45 µm, as calculated from in vivo measurements and
the morphometric data in Table 33 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Conical to pyriform, table
tennis racket-shaped when caudal cirral bundle is included (Fig. 81a, c, e, f, 82a–g, i, q–t, 83a, e,
h, j); flattened only when undernourished (Fig. 82q, r). Anterior body end transverse truncate or
slightly convex, almost completely surrounded by adoral zone of membranelles; posterior region
distinctly narrowed to an acute process bearing caudal cirri. Nuclear apparatus in or slightly anterior
of mid-body near left margin of cell, consists of two slenderly to broadly ellipsoid macronuclear
nodules rather close together, may form a triangular pattern connected by a fine strand in post-
dividers; many minute nucleoli up to 4 µm in size. Micronucleus conspicuous because 6–10 µm
across in vivo, between and slightly left of macronuclear nodules (Fig. 81a, e, 82a–g, i; Table
33); in some specimens contains about 8 µm long, thin rods, possibly chromosomes or bacterial
parasites. Contractile vacuole in or near mid-body at left margin of cell, contents expelled through
a slightly curved slit (Fig. 81a, 82v, w). Cortex flexible and rather fragile, without specific granules.
Cytoplasm colourless, studded with moderately refractive granules about 1 µm across, some to many
food vacuoles up to 30 µm across, and lipid droplets 5–10 µm in size; crystals absent. Contains
many spirochetes under frontal membranelles and in narrow posterior end; spirochetes about 10
µm long and deeply impregnating with protargol (Fig. 81a, e, 82h, j, l–p, 83m, o, q, u). Further, 2–3
µm long, deeply impregnating bacteria form aggregates in rather large vacuoles in posterior third of
cell (Fig. 81a, 82f, j, k). Feeds on bacteria, green flagellates, and small ciliates (Fig. 81a, 82d, f, m, 83l,
n, 84a, b, d). Movement similar to that of oligotrichs, i.e., swims very fast forewords, then suddenly
stops swimming backwards for short distances as fast as lightening. Very likely, the frontal adoral
membranelles involved in swimming so fast because cirri too thin and sparse.
Somatic ciliature remarkable because sparse and cirri composed of only 2–6 cilia about 15 µm
long in vivo; frontal and caudal cirri slightly thickened, the latter 25–30 µm long in vivo (Fig. 81a,
c, 82a–d, u, 83e, h). Altogether 20 cirri on average: three subapical frontal cirri in a nearly vertical
row; one buccal cirrus subapical of paroral membrane; two short, slightly oblique ventral rows
with an average of three cirral pairs showing an indistinct zigzag pattern, commence far subapically
and end far subterminally; both marginal rows commence at level of buccal vertex and end far
subterminally; right row composed of an average of four cirri, left of three; transverse cirri absent.
An average of three “dorsal” bristles in anterior right quadrant of cell, i.e., on margin of ventral side;
continue as right row of marginal cirri.
Dorsal infraciliature complex, i.e., three slightly obliquely extending ordinary (“long”) bristle
rows commencing about 20 µm subapically and ending about 15 µm subterminally; at right posterior
end of each “long” kinety two “short” kineties, each rightmost “short” row generates a 25–30 µm
long caudal cirrus together forming a rather thick bundle, caudal cirri 2 and 3 more close than cirri
1 Note by H. Berger: These slides also contain specimens of → Pseudofuscheria magna. The sentence “The slide contain-
ing the holotype and four paratype slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in …” seems to be
not quite correct. I found four slides (one holotype, three paratypes) labelled exclusively with Conothrix australiensis
(Fig. 34a–f in Chapter 5 of present book). In addition, paratypes of Conothrix australiensis are contained in the type
slides of → Pseudofuscheria magna (Fig. 9a–g in Chapter 5 of present book).

distinctly projecting over endoral, projecting portion spoon-shaped in about one third of specimens
(Fig. 82c, d), sail-shaped, i.e., cilia in vivo about 10 µm long in anterior third and decreasing to
1–2 µm posteriorly; endoral projecting over paroral posteriorly. Buccal cavity about 10 µm width
in protargol preparations, left margin of buccal roof distinctly bulged, a rare pattern as yet found
only in psilotrichids (Heber et al. 2014, 2018). Pharyngeal fibres fine, impregnated rarely, extend
rectangularly to right body margin (Fig. 81a, c, 82a, c, d, f, u, 83a, b, d–f, h; Table 33).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i.e., in floodplain soil of Australia.
This species very likely lives in the microaerobic bottom plankton, as indicated by the cytoplasmic
bacteria and the disappearance when freshwater was added to the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Further, ordinary culture trials failed.

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
Remarks: There is only one described species in vivo highly resembling Conothrix australiensis,
viz., Psilotrichides hawaiiensis (Heber et al. 2014, 2018; Fig. 81b, d, g). They can be clearly
distinguished in protargol preparations by the dorsal infraciliature: C. australiensis has “long” and
“short” dorsal kineties and three caudal cirri while P. hawaiiensis has only three “long” kineties and
lacks caudal cirri (the elongated last cirrus belongs to left marginal row and is thus not a caudal
cirrus). In vivo, the best feature is the posterior body region: distinctly narrowed in C. australiensis
while bluntly acute in P. hawaiiensis (cp. Fig. 81a, c, e, f with 81b, d, g).
Ventral ontogenesis: When preserved, the species was in the logarithmic growth phase and thus
rather many dividers were present so that the full cycle could be re-constructed. For discussion, see
remarks to the diagnoses.
The oral primordium originates in a flat pouch close posterior to the buccal vertex. Concomitantly,
the paroral cilia of the proter become disorganized and shorter (Fig. 83e, f). Soon, the oral
primordium grows to an oblong structure with disorganized ciliary stumps (Fig. 83g, h). Next, new
adoral membranelles and the anlage for the opisthe undulating membranes are produced (Fig. 83i,
j, n, o). Concomitantly, four cirral anlagen each are produced in proter and opisthe by the buccal
cirrus and some ventral cirri. Further, the dorsomarginal kinety and the right row of marginal cirri
originate de novo while the left row of marginal cirri is generated in the ordinary way (Fig. 83n, o).
In mid-dividers, which have fused macronuclear nodules, the opisthe oral primordium has produced
the anlage for the undulating membranes and most adoral membranelles which form a slightly
convex, vertical row. In the proter, a new paroral is generated, very likely by lateral proliferation
of basal bodies by the endoral membrane. New cirri are generated in the anlagen (Fig. 83o–t).
When cell furrowing commences, the opisthe oral primordium becomes semicircular and extends
horizontally in posterior quarters. All cirri have been generated in the anlagen and most moved
to the species-specific sites; parental cirri are resorbed. In the proter, the undulating membranes
reorganized and are close together (Fig. 84a, b). When furrowing is distinct, the new zone of adoral
membranelles is horizontally oriented and the proter undulating membranes are separate. The
globular macronuclear mass divided into two nodules connected by a fine strand. The micronucleus
also divided (Fig. 84c, d, f, h).
Dorsal ontogenesis: Conothrix australiensis has three types of dorsal bristle rows: three long
rows, as typical for hypotrichs, and two short rows right of the posterior region of each long row.
The third type is the ventrally located and de novo generated dorsomarginal kinety (see ventral
ontogenesis above).
The dorsal ontogenesis commences in early mid-dividers when the macronuclear nodules are not
yet fused. Left of the long rows develop de novo new kineties in the anterior and posterior half of
the cell (Fig. 84c, e). The new dikinetids are easily recognizable by their narrow spacing (Fig. 83k).
In mid-dividers, the new rows are growing and segregate two short rows in the posterior region of
each long row; each rightmost short row forms a caudal cirrus (Fig. 83u, 84c–e). It is unique that all
long bristle rows are ontogenetically active and segregate two short kineties.

produce a moderately distinct fringe though colourless, thin and short, i.e., about 3.0 × 0.4 µm in
vivo (Fig. 85b, 87a, e, g); do not impregnate with the method used. When methyl green-pyronin
is added, they stain red and transform to about 10 µm long, wrinkled cones forming a thin cover
on cell (Fig. 87d, h), composed of a thin wall surrounding a rather dense content (Fig. 87c).
Exploding cortical granules ellipsoid and quickly transforming to straight or curved cones with
concave anterior end in the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 87f, i, j, l). Cytoplasm usually
studded with food vacuoles up to 25 µm across in protargol preparations; with many slightly
orange lipid(?) droplets 1–3 µm across in vivo providing cells with an orange shimmer in the
bright field microscope; and crystals mainly in posterior half of cell (Fig. 85a, c, 87a, g). Feeds on
a variety of items preferring Bromeliothrix metopoides, a small, bromeliad-specific ciliate (Foissner
2010a). Further, flagellates (Polytomella) and euglenoids (Peranema, moves five or more minutes
in the food vacuoles) have been observed in the food vacuoles; in cultures, also feeds on bacteria,
fungal spores, and starch grains. Glides moderately fast on microscope slides and in mud, showing
great flexibility.
Cirri in Oxytricha pattern with three remarkable specializations (Fig. 85a, 86a, b, 87j, k, p; Table
34): (i) transverse cirri thickened and placed far anteriorly (23% of body length on average or 31 µm
distant from body end) never protruding from body proper though 25–30 µm long in vivo, distal
end fringed; (ii) marginal cirral rows slightly overlapping posteriorly (Fig. 85a, 86a, c, 87k); (iii)
buccal cirrus slightly anterior or posterior to anterior end of paroral membrane, on average at same
level, i.e., 13.5 µm distant from anterior body end (Table 34). Frontal, ventral, and postoral cirri
slightly thickened, these and marginal cirri about 20 µm long in vivo.
Dorsal bristles 4–5 µm long in vivo, arranged as described in diagnosis of genus, viz., three bipolar
kineties in left half of cell and posteriorly curved to right margin; each kinety associated with an
about 25 µm long, fine, and lively beating caudal cirrus. Three, rarely four dorsomarginal kineties in
right half of cell. About 15 scattered dikinetids between bipolar and dorsomarginal kineties (Fig.
86b, 87r, s; Table 34).
Oral apparatus in Oxytricha pattern, of ordinary size, i.e., extends on average 35% of body length,
consist of about 41 membranelles with ordinary shape and structure, however, largest membranellar
bases only about 12 µm wide in vivo and 8 µm in protargol preparations, i.e., narrow compared to size
of body and oral apparatus. Buccal cavity also narrow and shallow. Paroral and endoral membrane
optically side by side slightly overlapping or crossing in anterior third; paroral cilia about 8 µm long
in vivo, endoral cilia extend into cytopharynx but do not perform wave-like movements. Buccal
lip slightly convex, of angular type (Foissner & Al-Rasheid 2006). Pharyngeal fibres extend to or
slightly posterior to mid-body (Fig. 85a, 86a, 87a, j, k, p; Tables 31, 34).
Resting cyst: Without slime cover about 50 × 48 µm across in vivo, i.e., on average almost
globular and very slightly green-yellow due to the brownish ectocyst (Fig. 85d, 87m, n; Table 34);
colour disappears in squeezed cysts. Young cysts covered by an about 10 µm thick slime layer almost
disappearing in old cysts (Fig. 87m, n); slime layer colonized by various bacteria, stains red with
methyl green-pyronin. Ectocyst smooth, about 2 µm thick, composed of two brownish membranes;
followed by a 1–2 µm thick, bright zone, possibly the endocyst. Old cysts frequently with double
ectocyst, usually with a granular heap between walls (Fig. 87o). Macronuclear nodules fused to an
irregular mass (Fig. 85d, 87m, o). Cytoplasm of young cysts studded with autophagous vacuoles
3–6 µm in diameter (Fig. 85d, 87m, n).
Ontogenesis: On the ventral side, the ontogenesis of the oral apparatus and the cirral pattern
is highly similar to that described for Oxytricha granulifera, type species of the genus (for a review,
see Berger 1999). Thus, only some key stages are shown. The ontogenesis commences with the
proliferation of basal bodies left and slightly anterior of the uppermost transverse cirrus. Further
proliferation of basal bodies produces the oral primordium extending from the uppermost transverse
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 55–345 / 282

Chapter 4: Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and some other parts of the world
cirrus to the buccal vertex where the primordium has a short streak in the right corner contacting
the parental undulating membranes (Fig. 86c). Concomitantly, the buccal cirrus, frontoventral
cirrus III/2, and the second postoral cirrus transform to cirral anlagen (Fig. 86c, 87q). The further
process, e.g., the production of cirri and their migration to the species-specific sites are shown in
Fig. 86e.
The dorsal ontogenesis basically matches the Oxytricha mode, i.e., the three bipolar bristles
rows on the left half of the cell develop three anlagen each in proter and opisthe (Fig. 85e, f).
Concomitantly, three (rarely four) dorsomarginal kineties are generated in proter and opisthe at the
anterior end of the right marginal cirral rows (Fig. 86d, e). The anlagen in row 3 show disordered,
multiple fragmentation and are slightly longer than those in rows 1 and 2; they migrate rightwards
and disperse to scattered dikinetids in midline of body (Fig. 86b, 87r, s). This is rather different to
the usual Oxytricha mode and a main character of the genus Apooxytricha (Fig. 85e, f).
Occurrence and ecology: Rare, i.e., as yet found only at type locality. Grows weakly in ordinary
cultures with tank water and squeezed wheat grains.
Remarks: In vivo, Apooxytricha bromelicola is difficult to separate from several middle-sized or
large oxytrichids (Table 31). The best features are the far anteriorly placed transverse cirri, the rather
large body size, the colourless cortical granules, and the habitat.
Monomicrocaryon australiense nov. spec.
(Fig. 88a–e, g, 89a–f; Table 35 on p. 342)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo about 150 × 50 µm; parallel-sided or slightly ellipsoid. Buccal cirrus subapical
of paroral membrane, last frontoventral cirrus at level of buccal vertex; transverse cirri thickened,
about 40 µm long in vivo, do not project from body proper because about 22% anterior from body
end. Dorsal bristles 4–5 µm long, arranged in seven kineties with kinety 6 in posterior third of cell
and kinety 7 in anterior third; scattered bristles (short kineties?) between kineties 2 and 3. Three
comparatively thick caudal cirri 35–40 µm long in vivo. Adoral zone extends about 30% of body
length, composed of an average of 25 membranelles with bases up to 10 µm width. Buccal cavity
in vivo narrow and flat; paroral and endoral membrane slightly curved and optically one upon the
other or close together.
Type locality: Australian site (159), i.e., upper, dark brown soil mixed with red gum leaves
from the Murray River floodplain below the Hume Dam, Caravan Park, Australia, 36°06'16.0''S,
147°01'51.3''E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype (Fig. 88b, c) and six paratype slides with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI). The holotype and relevant paratype specimens have been marked with black
ink circles on the coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 36a–i in Chapter 5.
Etymology: Named after the continent found, i.e., Australia.
Description: The cortex of Monomicrocaryon australiense is rather fragile. Thus, the cells are
more or less inflated and wrinkled in the protargol preparations (CV of, e.g., body width on average
16.4; Table 35). Further, the abundance was low. Thus, the dorsal kinety pattern was difficult to
study and might be not entirely correct.
The variability is low, i.e., of the 35 features investigated only 10 have a coefficient of variation
>15%, and none of these is a diagnostic feature.
Size in vivo 110–170 × 30–50 µm, usually about 150 × 50 µm, as calculated from in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data in Table 35 adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body
elongate ellipsoid or parallel-sided with both ends broadly rounded; moderately flattened laterally

30 µm across and, mainly in posterior half, many bright lipid droplets 1–10 µm in size (Fig. 89f);
crystals absent. Feeds on ciliates, flagellates, and a euglenoid. Creeps slowly on microscope slides,
when swimming rotates about main body axis.
Cirral pattern oxytrichid, i.e., 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri; all cirri conspicuously long
and thus distinct in vivo (Fig. 88a, b, d, 89a, b; Table 35). Frontal cirri in vivo about 35 µm long,
moderately thick, cirrus 3 at level of buccal cirrus subapical of paroral membrane. Last frontoventral
cirrus slightly thickened and at level of buccal vertex. Transverse cirri on average 22% anterior of
body end, distinctly thickened and up to 40 µm long in vivo, do not project from body proper.
Marginal cirral rows almost abutting posteriorly, up to 30 µm long, each composed of three rows of
basal bodies (Fig. 88a, b, d, 89a, b; Table 35).

specimen. The arrow marks the last frontoventral cirrus at level of buccal vertex. Note the far anteriorly located
transverse cirri, a main feature of this species. f: This species is 100–120 µm long and has the last frontoventral cirrus
(arrow) at level of midbuccal cavity. g: Lateral view. h: Ventral view. This species resembles M. australiense but has,
inter alia, a much larger adoral zone of membranelles and the last frontoventral cirrus is slightly anterior of the buccal
vertex (arrow). AM – adoral membranelles, CC – caudal cirri, DK6, 7 – dorsal kineties, FC3 – frontal cirrus, LM – left
marginal cirral row, PTC – pretransverse cirri, TC – transverse cirri. Scale bars 40 µm (h) and 50 µm (d, e).
Dorsal bristles 3–4 µm long in vivo, likely arranged in seven rows with several peculiarities (Fig.
88b–e; Table 35): (i) all kineties commence far subapical; (ii) a field of scattered bristles between
kineties 2 and 3, possibly produced by kinety 2 slightly shortened posteriorly; (iii) kinety 6 extends
in posterior third, possibly produced by kinety 5; (iv) kinety 7 extends in anterior body half, likely
produced dorsomarginally; and (v) three lively beating, comparatively thick caudal cirri 35–40 µm
long in vivo (Fig. 88a–c, 89e).
Oral apparatus extends 30% of body length on average (Fig. 88a, b, d, 89a, b; Table 35). Adoral
zone of ordinary shape and structure, twisted in proximal third and thus appearing narrower than
it is, composed of an average of 25 rather widely spaced membranelles with largest bases about
10 µm wide in vivo, cilia of frontal membranelles about 35 µm long. Buccal cavity narrow and
flat, widened by the preparation procedures; buccal lip also narrow. Paroral and endoral membrane
slightly curved and optically one upon the other or close together.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i.e., floodplain soil from the Murray
River, Australia.
Remarks: There is only one congener, Monomicrocaryon kahlovata (Berger, 1999) Foissner, 2016,
that has the transverse cirri so far anteriorly as M. australiense (Fig. 88f). The two species differ by body
shape (distinctly obovate vs. parallel-sided), the last frontoventral cirrus (at level of mid buccal cavity vs.
buccal vertex), body size (in vivo 100–120 µm vs. 120–170 µm), and the transverse cirri (thin vs. thick).

ovata) is meagre, and thus these species are rather difficult to separate. For another similar species, see
Fig. 88h. A redescription of a European population of M. kahlovata is urgently needed.
According to the dorsal kinety pattern, M. australiense could represent a distinct genus. However,
the data are not entirely clear due to the fragility of the cortex. Thus, data from a second population
and about ontogenesis should be available before genus and rank are changed.

Monomicrocaryon opisthomuscorum (Foissner, Blatterer, Berger & Kohmann, 1991) Foissner,
2016
(Fig. 90a–l, 91a–e; Table 35 on p. 342)
Material: Upper 3 cm soil layer of a dry mangrove forest about 150 m distant from the Atlantic
Ocean coast in the surroundings of the village of Maimon, i.e., about 10 km west of the town of
Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic (~19°N, 72°W). Soil covered with a 1–3 cm thick litter layer,
fluffy because containing many fine roots and only partially decomposed litter, almost black; pH in
water 6.2, salinity 5‰. Collected in August 2002, investigated in June 2003.
Three voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology
Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI).1 Relevant specimens have been marked by
black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description and remarks: For synonymy, see Berger (1999) and Foissner (2016). The Dominican
specimens of M. opisthomuscorum match almost perfectly the Antarctic specimens described by Petz
& Foissner (1997). I found only two differences worth to be mentioned: the number of dorsal
kineties (invariably five vs. five or six with kinety 6 comprising only two or three kinetids) and
dorsal kinety 1 which has an up to two-kinetids-wide gap (Fig. 90b) not mentioned in the Antarctic
specimens.
In vivo, M. opisthomuscorum is difficult to separate from Oxytricha setigera (now Quadristicha
setigera (Stokes, 1891) Foissner, 2016) because both have a similar size and shape of body and
oral apparatus as well as long dorsal bristles. In morphostatic specimens, the main difference is the
location of the buccal cirrus: near anterior end of paroral membrane vs. near its posterior end (Fig.
90a, 91a). In dividing specimens, there is a main difference in the genesis of the dorsal ciliature:
kinety 3 splits to produce kinety 4 (Fig. 90b, j, 91b, c) vs. without kinety split (Berger 1999).
Ontogenesis: Monomicrocaryon opisthomuscorum has an oxytrichid ontogenesis. Streaks V and
VI are primary primordia. Further details, see figure explanations.
Oxytricha africana australiensis nov. sspec.
(Fig. 92a–e)
Diagnosis: Dorsal bristles arranged in five uninterrupted rows, row 1 straight or slightly curved
rightwards posteriorly.
Type locality: Australian site (27), i.e., surface soil from Green Island east of the town of Cairns,
~17°02'07''S, 145°05'09''E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype (Fig. 92b) and one paratype slide with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI).2 Relevant specimens have been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
For slides, see Fig. 23a, c, d, 37a–c in Chapter 5.
Etymology: The Latin adjective australiensis (belonging to Australia) refers to the country the
species was discovered.
Description and remarks: The new subspecies differs from the nominotypical subspecies
Oxytricha africana africana Foissner, 1999 by the number of dorsal kineties (five vs. six), the absence
of a break in dorsal kinety 1, and the only indistinct (vs. distinct) posterior curve of dorsal kinety 1

(Fig. 92b, c). These are rather subtle differences. However, the number and shape of dorsal kineties
are widely used as species or subspecies character (for a review, see Berger 1999).
Minor differences: The dorsal bristles of the Australian subspecies are slightly shorter than
those of the nominotypical subspecies, i.e., about 6 µm (vs. 10 µm) in anterior body half and up
to 10 µm in posterior half, as in O. africana africana (Foissner 1999). The conspicuous fibre system
associated with the thick frontal cirri (Fig. 92d, e) has been not described by Foissner (1999). Very
likely, its visibility depends on the preparation conditions. All other features are very similar in both
subspecies.
Oxytricha lithofera Foissner, 2016
(Fig. 93a–f)
Material: Australian site (170), i.e., ephemeral puddles on top of Uluru (Ayers Rock). Two voucher
slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the
Upper Austrian Museum in Linz (LI). Some specimens are marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip. For slides, see Fig. 38a, b in Chapter 5.
Remarks: The type population occurred in slightly saline (~10‰) moss from a small cave at
the north coast of Venezuela (Foissner 2016). The Australian population is so similar to the type
that I provide only some micrographs, showing main features of this species, viz., the lithosomes
(Fig. 93a–c), the break in dorsal kinety 1 (Fig. 93f), and the oral apparatus where the straight,
oblique undulating membranes are more close to the adoral zone of membranelles anteriorly than
posteriorly (Fig. 93d, e). This special arrangement indicates a distinct genus.
When heavily pressed, the lithosomes break into pieces with sharp outlines, and they dissolve
in protargol preparations, indicating an anorganic nature. There are two congeners that have two

cirri forming a row extending between level of buccal vertex and uppermost transverse cirrus. Four
dorsal kineties with 2–3 µm long bristles except of last kinetid of kineties 2 and 3 associated with
an about 10 µm long bristle. Adoral zone extends over about 36% of body length, composed of an
average of 14 membranelles; paroral and endoral membrane in straight, oblique line.
Type locality: Australian site (26), i.e., litter, roots and sandy soil from the palm girdle about 30
m inshore of Green Island east of the town of Cairns, 17°S, 146°E.
Type material: The slide containing the holotype (Fig. 94b, c) and three paratype slides with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian
Museum in Linz (LI).1 Relevant specimens haven been marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Further, I marked some specimens of Oxytrichella mahadjacola on one of the paratype slides. For
slides, see Fig. 39a–f in Chapter 5.
Etymology: The Latin adjective setifera (bristle-bearing) refers to the two distinctly elongated
bristles of the last kinetid of dorsal kineties 2 and 3.
Description: The main features of T. setifera have a low variability, i.e., the CV ≤10%. Thus, the
species can be sharply defined.
Size in vivo 35–50 × 15–25 µm, usually about 45 × 20 µm, as calculated from protargol-
impregnated specimens (Table 36) adding 15% preparation shrinkage. Body ellipsoid, length:width
ratio 2.2:1 on average; often slightly widened posterior of mid-body, rarely almost rectangular;
posterior end nipple-like shrunken in about one third of protargol-impregnated specimens, ventral
side flat, dorsal more or less convex, depending on amount of food vacuoles (Fig. 94a, b, 95a–e, g, h;

thus no distance in between. Micronucleus upon or on side of macronuclear nodules, globular and
of ordinary size. Contractile vacuole slightly anterior of mid-body in left margin of cell. Cortex
flexible, without specific granules. Cytoplasm colourless, usually with rather many, about 5 µm-
sized food vacuoles containing intensely impregnated bacterial spores about 1.0 × 0.7 µm in size
(Fig. 94a, 95c). Moves moderately rapid on microscope slides and soil particles.
Most cirri 7–10 µm long except of the 15 µm long, slightly thickened transverse cirri; arranged
in typical Oxytricha pattern (Fig. 94a, b, 95a, b, d–h; Table 36; for a review, see Berger 1999).
Three slightly thickened frontal cirri, cirrus 3 far subapical and thus easily misidentified as an adoral
membranelle; three of the four frontoventral cirri form an oblique line (Fig. 95h, i); buccal cirrus
subapical of paroral membrane; postoral and transverse cirri in ordinary position; right marginal
row in middle third of body, composed of an average of three widely spaced cirri; left marginal row
extends between level of buccal vertex and uppermost transverse cirrus, composed of an average of
four widely spaced cirri.
Invariably four dorsal kineties composed of comparatively wide-spaced, 2–3 µm long bristles
except of rows 2 and 3 the last dikinetid of which has an about 10 µm long anterior bristle and a 3–5
µm long posterior bristle sometimes lacking or not impregnated (Fig. 94c, 95e, g; Table 36). Row
1 distinctly shortened anteriorly and posteriorly, rows 2 and 3 slightly shortened anteriorly, row 4
dorsomarginal, consists of only three or four dikinetids thus ending anterior of mid-body.
Oral apparatus of ordinary structure and size (Fig. 94a, b, 95a–f, h; Table 36). Adoral zone extends
36% of body length on average, composed of 12–15 ordinary membranelles, largest membranellar
bases 4 µm wide in protargol preparations, cilia up to 12 µm long in vivo. Undulating membranes
short, form slightly oblique line directed right. Buccal cavity flat and of ordinary width. Pharyngeal
fibres distinct in protargol preparations, extend beyond mid-body (Fig. 95e).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality though I investigated several samples
from the surroundings. The small size suggests T. setifera as a true soil inhabitant.
Tachysoma setifera is an impressive Australian endemic. Interestingly, it occurs together with T.
humicola humicola Gellért, 1957, a supposed cosmopolitan, while the African subspecies, T. humicola
longisetum Foissner, 1998, has three elongated dorsal bristles and more cirri in the marginal rows
and dikinetids in the dorsal kineties (Fig. 94d; Table 36).
Remarks: I classify the Australian population as a distinct species because it is more different
from the nominal subspecies of T. humicola than T. humicola longisetum (Table 37).
There are rather many similar species from different genera making in vivo identification
difficult. However, all have caudal cirri well recognizable in vivo, for instance, → Oxytrichella
mahadjacola Foissner, 2016 (only four transverse cirri, long dorsal bristles, undulating membranes
distinctly curved; Fig. 95j–l), → Monomicrocaryon opisthomuscorum (long dorsal bristles, undulating
membranes distinctly curved; Fig. 90a, b), and Quadristicha setigera (long dorsal bristles, undulating
membranes distinctly curved), all reviewed by Berger (1999) and Foissner (2016).

Remarks: In this species, I observed that the paroral basal bodies are reduced anteriorly while their
fibrillar associates are still present, a very strange feature. Thus, I did what I should have done before
publication, i.e., I reinvestigated the type slides of Pattersoniella vitiphila Foissner, 1987a. Indeed,
they have a paroral as described for P. australiensis described by Kumar & Foissner (2016). Thus, this
feature should be abandoned from the diagnosis of Pattersoniellides.
Based on the new data, the diagnoses of the subgenera Pattersoniella (Pattersoniella) Foissner,
1987a and Pattersoniella (Pattersoniellides) must be emended.

Foissner Wilhelm
Emendation of Pattersoniella Foissner, 1987a: Rigid oxytrichids with three frontal and one
buccal cirrus or with distinctly increased fronto-ventral cirri forming a bicorona. Two pretransverse
and more than five transverse cirri. One right and one left row of marginal cirri. Undulating
membranes in Australocirrus pattern; paroral membrane complete or some basal bodies reduced
anteriorly while their fibrillar associates still present. Number of fronto-ventral-transverse cirral
streaks distinctly increased (7–11 vs. 6 in “typical” oxytrichids). More than six dorsal kineties due
to multiple fragmentation of dorsal kinety 3 and two dorsomarginal rows; some parental kinetids
retained after division. Caudal cirri present.
Emendation of Pattersoniella (Pattersoniella) Foissner, 1987a: Pattersoniella with an increased
number of fronto-ventral cirri forming a bicorona.
Type species: Pattersoniella (Pattersoniella) vitiphila Foissner, 1987a. 1
Emendation of Pattersoniella (Pattersoniellides) Kumar & Foissner, 2016: Pattersoniella with
three frontal and one buccal cirrus arranged in Oxytricha pattern.
Type species: Pattersoniella (Pattersoniellides) australiensis Kumar & Foissner, 2016.

Chapter 5
Type and voucher slides of taxa described by W. Foissner in the
chapter “Taxonomy of soil ciliates (Ciliophora) from Australia and
some other parts of the world”1

In the present chapter, the type and voucher slides of the species and subspecies described in
Chapter 4 (Foissner 2021) of the present book are depicted (Fig. 1a–e to Fig. 39a–f). Fortunately,
Wilhelm Foissner has already prepared the relevant slides (holotypes, paratype slides, vouchers) for
deposition in the museum. As is usual, the slides will be stored in the Upper Austrian Museum in
Linz (LI); for details on this acknowledged depository, see Aescht (2008, 2013, 2018a, b).
For some species described by Foissner (2021), the type slides have been deposited already much
earlier in Linz, for example, for Protocyclidium namibiense Foissner, 2021 because this species
was established for the Namibian population of Protocyclidium terricola (Kahl, 1931) Foissner et
al., 2002 as described by Foissner et al. (2002). The voucher slides of the Namibian population
(accession numbers 84–86/2002; see Foissner et al. 2002, p. 42), deposited in Linz since 2002, are
now the type slides of Protocyclidium namibiense and thus not shown in the present work.
Some slides contain the type specimens of two or more species. For example, in four slides from
a sample from Uluru (English colonial name: Ayers Rock), four new species are contained, namely
Protocyclidium bimacronucleatum Foissner, 2021 and its parasite Microsporidium protocyclicola
Foissner, 2021, Urosomoida uluruensis Foissner, 2021, and Hausmanniella uluruensis (this species
was not yet described by W. Foissner and thus this name is disclaimed for nomenclatural purposes,
ICZN 1999, Article 8.3; Fig. 24a–h). The slide shown in Fig. 11a contains not only the holotype of
Bryophyllum australiense (see Chapter 4, p. 125), but also the types of two so far undescribed species
belonging to the genera Arcuospathidium and Protospathidium, respectively (Fig. 11b). The voucher
slides of Gonostomum affine and Monomicrocaryon opisthomuscorum, mentioned by Foissner (2021),
are not detectable at present.

a Voucher slides not detectable at present (see text).
b Figures 14a, d show the same slide (see legend for explanation). Thus, for Wolfkosia acuta only five type slides and not
six have been deposited.
c This slide usually also contains paratypes.
For photographing, the slides have been placed on a white sheet of paper with a 5 mm-grid of
black dots. The photos have been taken with a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S8+) under somewhat
suboptimal conditions of illumination and thus they are not perfect. A photographic documentation
of the deposited slides has the advantage that the position of tags (usually black ink circles on the
Series Monographiae Ciliophorae, Number 5, Year 2021, pages 347–369 / 349

Berger Helmut
cover glass) are known even when the tags are lost, for example, due to the use of oil immersion
or cleaning of slides. For a more simple and precise method of marking relevant specimens on a
microscopic slide, see Chapter 1 (Berger 2021).
For some slides, a sheet of paper equally sized to the slide is available showing the positions of
relevant specimens (e.g., holotype; Fig. 1b). This sheet of paper was termed “protocol” by Aescht
(2008, p. 137, 138). In the figures of the present chapter, the protocol is, if available, always shown
underneath the corresponding slide. In the print edition, the slides are shown in original size (76 ×
26 mm). For explanation of labelling of slides, see Fig. 8 in Chapter 3 of present book.
The arrangement of the slides (Fig. 1a–e to Fig. 39a–f) in the present work follows the
arrangement of the species and subspecies in Chapter 4 (Foissner 2021). For alphabetical order of
species and subspecies, see Table 1.

Systematic index to “ Terrestrial ciliates (Protista, Ciliophora) from
Australia and some other parts of the world”1

General remarks
The index contains all names mentioned in the book, including vernacular names for example,
urostylids. Most entries refer to Chapter 4. Designations as, for example, “colpodid ciliates” are
mentioned under the corresponding vernacular name, that is, “colpodids” in present example.
Singular (e.g., colpodid) is mentioned under the plural version (e.g., colpodids). The index is two-
sided, that is, species appear both with the genus-group name first (for example, Enchelariophrya
micrographica) and with the species-group name first (micrographica, Enchelariophrya). Valid
(in W. Foissner’s judgement) species and genera treated in detail in Chapter 4 are in boldface
italics print. Valid taxa not treated in detail in the present book, invalid taxa, junior homonyms,
synonyms, outdated combinations, incorrect spellings, and nomina nuda are given in italics. The
scientific name of a subgenus, when used with a binomen or trinomen, must be interpolated in
parentheses between the genus-group name and the species-group name (ICZN 1999, Article
6.1)2. In the following index, these parentheses are omitted to simplify electronic sorting. Thus,
the name “Pattersoniella (Pattersoniellides) australiensis” is listed as “Pattersoniella Pattersoniellides
australiensis”. Note that this name is also listed under “Pattersoniellides australiensis, Pattersoniella”
and “australiensis, Pattersoniella Pattersoniellides”. Suprageneric taxa are represented in normal type,
valid ones treated in detail in the present work in boldface. Boldface page number indicates the
begin of the description of a valid taxon in Chapter 4. “T” indicates the location of the table with
the morphometric characterisation; “K” marks the page where a taxon is mentioned in a key. Taxa
of molecular trees (Fig. 19, 38 in Chapter 4) are not considered in the index.

other parts of the world. — Ser. Monogr. Cilioph. 5: i–xii, 1–380.
The main chapter of the present work deals with ciliates found in soil samples from Australia and some
other parts of the world, namely, Austria, Botswana, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Madeira Island
(Portugal), Mexico, Namibia, Sweden, The Netherlands, and the USA. It is the main work of Wilhelm Ciliophora) from Australia and &
Foissner’s (1948–2020) last scientific project. In total, six subspecies, 32 new species, 11 new genera, one Berger
new combination, one new subfamily, and three new families are described and established, respectively.
In addition, the status of two taxa is changed and 18 redescriptions, emendations, and remarks are
provided. The type and voucher slides of the species and subspecies treated are figured in a separate some other parts of the world
(Eds.)
chapter. Another part of the book deals with methods of sampling, collection of material for preparations,
identification, description, species concept, and types. Microscopical methods for taxonomic studies of
ciliates are updated.
