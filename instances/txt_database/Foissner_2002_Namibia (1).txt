Namibia (Southwest Africa) is well-known for its contrasting environments, especially the
Namib Desert and the Etosha National Park. Thus, after a holiday travelling through Namibia
in February 1994, I came back to Austria with 73 well-sorted soil samples, on which I
worked, with some interruptions, for seven years, with the indispensable help of Dr. Sabine
AGATHA, Dr. Brigitte MOSER, and Prof. Dr. Helmut BERGER, to describe the over 200 rare
and new species found.
The resulting monograph is unique in many ways. For the first time since the unforgotten
monographs by MÜLLER (1786), EHRENBERG (1838), STEIN (1859, 1867), PENARD (1922),
and KAHL (1930-35), almost 150 new species are described in a single publication. The list
from the 73 samples comprises 365 painstakingly identified species and is by far the largest
number ever published in a single study from a comparatively small area. Thus, this list will
be an invaluable document for ecologists and biodiversity researchers. All species are
described by a combination of classic (live observation) and modern (silver impregnation,
scanning electron microscopy) methods, and many are illustrated by a multitude of excellent
micrographs, and, last but not least, all are documented by silver-impregnated types stored in
an acknowledged repository. Thus, we hope that our study will serve as an example for ciliate
community studies and will be as long-lived as those of the pioneers mentioned above.
Authors are listed in the order they contributed to the monograph. This statement and the
details mentioned below are important for historical reasons, the estimation of data quality
and, last but not least, fairness. However, I state that, if not otherwise indicated, all nomen-
clatural acts (new species, new genera, new combinations etc.) have to be cited as: FoiSSNER,
AGATHA & BERGER, 2002.
WILHELM FOISSNER made all species lists, the live observations with the raw illustrations, the
silver preparations, the light and scanning electron micrographs (with the invaluable assis-
tance of Dr. BRIGITTE MOSER, financed by the Austrian Science Foundation), the general
section, and the 158 species indicated in table 3. Further, FoiSSNER critically checked the
work done by Dr. AGATHA and Dr. BERGER. SABINE AGATHA completed (refined live illus-
trations; morphometry, illustrations and description) the 39 species indicated in table 3.
Further, she was responsible for the layout. Dr. AGATHA was financed by the Austrian
Science Foundation from 01.01.1998-30.06.2001. HELMUT BERGER completed, like AGATHA,
the 33 hypotrichs indicated in table 3. He was financed from FOISSNER'S private funds.
Financial support was provided by the Austrian Science Foundation, based on reviews by
three unknown colleagues. Without this grant, the work would have been impossible. We are
also very grateful to Prof. Dr. Hofrat Franz SPETA, head of the Museum of Natural History in
Linz, Austria, who made it possible to publish the work in Ml length and excellent quality.
All together, but without FOISSNER'S ordinary salary, $ 200,000 US were needed for this
book!
Further, I am indebted to Dr. Eva HERZOG for typing part of the manuscript; Dr. Remigius
GEISER for help with nomenclature; Mag. Eric STROBL and Dr. Steve WICKHAM for refining
the English; and Dr. Wolf-Dietrich KRAUTGARTNER for ensuring the smooth operation of the
scanning electron microscope.

Soil Ciliates (Protozoa, Ciliophora) from Namibia (Southwest Africa), with
Emphasis on Two Contrasting Environments, the Etosha Region and the
Namib Desert
Wilhelm FOISSNER, Sabine AGATHA and Helmut BERGER
Abstract: A highly diverse ciliate community was found in 73 samples from terrestrial and semiterrestrial
habitats of Namibia, Southwest Africa, one of the world's driest countries. The ciliate, respectively, their resting
cysts, were re-activated from air-dried samples using the non-flooded Petri dish method. Species were
determined by combining live observations, silver impregnation, and scanning electron microscopy.
A total of 365 species were identified, of which 128 (35%) were undescribed, including a new order and
suborder, three new families, and 34 new genera and subgenera. These new and many insufficiently known taxa,
altogether more than 200 species and subspecies and over 300 populations, are described in the present
monograph (see chapter 3.2.1 for a summary of names and nomenclatural acts); 800 type slides have been
deposited in (LI). Further, ontogenesis was investigated in 20 species.
The Namibian soil ciliate community shows some remarkable differences to the world community. Specifically,
raptorious gymnostomatids and filamentous cyanobacteria feeding nassulids are over-represented, while
hypotrichs and peritrichs are underrepresented. Nassulids obviously profit from the cyanobacteria covering wide
areas of the Etosha region and the crust soils in the arid areas. Hypotrichs are more k- than r-selected and thus
cannot develop optimally in the harsh Namibian climate. Likewise, the sandy soils are disadvantageous for
sessile peritrichs. Generally, however, the Namibian soil ciliate biota are unexpectedly rich, that is, more diverse
than those from central Europe, likely because they had at least 55 million years to evolve adapted populations
and species. 200 of the 365 ciliate species identified occur at only one or two sites, showing a very patchy
distribution of most species and a high proportion of possibly rare species. Most of the 11 most frequent (> 40%)
species are common in soils globally, except for Exocolpoda augustini, which is adapted to hyperarid conditions
by a special life cycle and an extraordinarily thick-walled (dormant) resting cyst. Using total species numbers
and the proportions of undescribed species, four local ciliate diversity centres were discovered: Etosha region
(19 samples with 216 species, of which 61 were undescribed); dune sea Namib Desert (15 samples with 150
species, of which 32 were undescribed); Aloe dichotoma forest and Bukaos River floodplain near the town of
Keetmanshoop (2 samples each with 11 new species); road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm (1 sample with
126 identified and 15 unidentified species, of which at least 40 were undescribed).
We estimate that there are about 1000 soil ciliate species in Namibia, of which 350 are undescribed, including an
unknown number of endemic species. Thus, our monograph contains only one third of the species actually living
in the highly diverse terrestrial habitats of this country. We show that there must be many more free-living ciliate
species globally than the 3000 estimated by FlNLAY. His estimation is flawed by biased literature evaluation,
doubtful synonymies, unusual taxonomic practices and, partially, false theoretical concepts. Undersampling is
the key to understanding protist diversity.
Key words: Adaptation, ciliate ecology, ciliate systematics, ciliate taxonomy, ciliate endemism, ciliate
biodiversity, global number of free-living ciliates, neotypification, new species, ontogenesis, saline desert, dune
desert, undersampling.

1. INTRODUCTION
Soil Protozoa were neglected for a long time and the species "identified" as a part of the
freshwater or even activated sludge community (FOISSNER 1987d). It was only between the
sixties and nineties that BONNET (1964) and FOISSNER (1987d) renewed the interest and
showed that soil testate amoebae and ciliate biota are fundamentally different from the
limnetic ones. This view, which is now widely accepted, is emphasized by the present study
which describes not only many new species, but also a considerable number of new organiza-
tion types (genera), as yet unknown from freshwater. Unfortunately, the interest in soil proto-
zoa is decreasing again, although many studies showed their importance in bioindication and
the soil energy cycle (EKELUND & R0NN 1994, FOISSNER 1987d, 1999e).
There is now much research and discussion on biodiversity and its application in conserva-
tion, seemingly indicating a flourishing alpha-taxonomy (= investigation and description of
species), the basestone of biodiversity research. Unfortunately, appearances are deceptive:
species describers and faunists who do the "hard work", that is, identify and eventually
describe new species, are decreasing in number, expertise, and social reputation, partially
because the large biodiversity programs are misused by other disciplines to acquire money for
purely ecological and/or conservation research (COTTERILL 1995, PRANCE 1995).
As concerns ciliates, ecologically and taxonomically orientated biodiversity researchers reach
entirely different conclusions about the number of free-living ciliate species: "As protozoans
species are probably globally ubiquitous, there is every reason to believe that all species of
freshwater protozoa could eventually be discovered in one small pond" (FINLAY & ESTEBAN
1998). FOISSNER (1999C), in contrast, states: "It is unlikely that total diversity of free-living
ciliates is close to 3000 or 4000 species, as proposed by FINLAY and FENCHEL. A more likely
figure is 30,000". Certainly, both statements are weakly founded and need more objective
discussion (FOISSNER 1999d). Generally, however, it is our belief that there is only one way to
get the truth, viz., the critical investigation of representative biomes by experienced taxono-
mists. The present monograph is the only recent example available. The immense amount of
work required can hardly be done by the few experts left, even if the financial resources were
available!
Thus, we shall probably not find out whether there are 3000 or 30,000 free-living ciliate
species during the coming centuries. But our study shows a high number of undescribed
species. This is emphasized by the following calculation: 643 ciliate species are known to
occur in terrestrial habitats, and more than half of them are likely confined to such environ-
ments (FOISSNER 1998a). With the species described here and some others from the literature,
we arrive at 800 species. This is half the number likely living in soil (FOISSNER 1997C).
Considering that a single working group increased the number of species from about 270 in
1987 to 800 in 2001, the estimated 1600 total appears reasonable (FOISSNER 1997C).
FINLAY et al. (1996) state that the main biotopes of the Earth have already been sufficiently
investigated for free-living ciliates. Clearly, this is not the case. Neither have ciliates been
investigated, for instance, in Namibia (BARNARD 1998), Australia (BLATTERER & FOISSNER
1988) and South America nor in the 25 world species diversity hotspots selected by MYERS et
al. (2000), except of the Mediterranean Basin. As concerns Namibia, we found only one small
paper describing Fabrea salina and Condylostoma sp. from saline Flamingo pools on the out-
skirts of Walvis Bay (BRAIN 1980).

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS, SPECIES CONCEPT, TYPES
2.1 Material
2.1.1 General Site Description
2.1.1.1 Brief Overview of Namibia (Fig. 1,2)
There is no need to describe Namibia in detail because many excellent travel guides are avail-
able and the centres of our sampling activity are treated in some detail in the paragraphs
below and the site descriptions.
Namibia, or Southwest Africa, extends for about 1000 km on the southwest coast of Africa
from about 17° to 29° south of the equator, and it is divided by the Tropic of Capricorn. Thus,
the region belongs to the subtropics. The land area is 823,988 km2, 45% of which is flat and
covered by bushveld in the central plateau at 1600 to 1800 m above sea level. Namibia has 1.6
million human inhabitants and a hyper-arid (west) to dry subhumid (east) climate. Rainfall is
mostly in summer and increasingly variable towards the west coast. It determines the three
main biomes of Namibia: desert, savannah, and woodland.
The overwhelming two features of Namibia's climate are the scarcity and unpredictability of
rainfall. Within Africa, the climate is second in aridity only to the Sahara. The country-wide
average rainfall of under 250 mm per year is coupled with annual mean evaporation of up to
3700 mm. Overall, 69% of the country is regarded as semi-arid, and 16% as arid. Most of
Namibia's rain falls in summer, from November to April; only the south western part of the
country also has winter rain, sustaining a diverse succulent flora. The combination of a cold,
subantarctic upwelling on the Atlantic coast and a hot subtropical interior have led to hyper-
arid, bleak coastal conditions in the Namib Desert, similar to those of Chile's Atacama Desert
and of Baja California, Mexico. Temperatures in Namibia can also be extremely variable with
values well over 50° C and under 0° C recorded in the same parts of the country. However, in
the tropical northeast and along the coast, daily highs and lows can differ by as little as 2-5° C
(BARNARD 1998).
Our soil ciliate samples represent roughly a quarter of Namibia's land area (Fig. 2) and are
from three contrasting environments, viz., an ephemeral wetland, that is, the Etosha Pan and
surroundings; the Namib Desert and Namib Escarpment; and savannahs. Certainly, this is
only a minor portion of the environments present in Namibia! For instance, freshwaters, the
"classic" habitats for ciliates, were not investigated at all, although Namibia has quite a lot of
nice riverine, lacustrine, palustrine and estuarine habitats (see the excellent overview by
BARNARD 1998). Further, the most productive region, the Caprivi Stripe at the northeast of
Namibia was not sampled, as the water-holes around the Etosha Pan. Likewise, the many
microhabitats present in any biome were rarely collected selectively, although they contain
many undescribed species, for instance, bark from trees, mud and soil from ephemeral rivers
and pools, and the many types of crust soil in the hyper-arid environments. Thus, the majority
of ciliate species present in Namibia is likely unknown, and certainly includes many new
species. Some of the above and other habitats were sampled during a second journey in
January 2001.
Sampling was possible due to Permits 09938P and 37213P of the Namibian Ministry of
Environment and Tourism.

2.1.1.2 The Etosha Pan (Fig. 1-3; 244-261)
The Etosha Pan (large, white place, according to the natives) is an ephemeral wetland famous
for its wildlife (the "big five": elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, giraffe) and habitat diversity
ranging from the saline Pan Desert to the ordinary savannah woodland. Sufficient rainfall
(about 430 mm/year) and steep gradients in soil physical and chemical parameters produced a
rich, sharply zonated flora and fauna. BERRY (1982), for instance, reports 689 plant species
belonging to 165 families, and about 150 vertebrates occur. Thus, the Etosha Pan was chosen
as one of the main areas for sampling soil ciliates. All samples (nos. 53-71) were taken at the
south edge of the Pan. The following paragraphs provide a brief general overview; for details
on sample sites (vegetation and soil types, rainfall etc.), see site description in chapter 2.1.2.
The Etosha National Park is located between 14°30' and 17°E, and 18°30' and 19°30'S. The
overall size is 22270 km2, of which salt pans occupy 23%; the main Pan measures about 120
x 55 km and covers an area of 5000 km2. The northwest corner (Ekuma) is 1073 m above
sea-level, the southwest corner "Okerfontein" 1086 m. Mean annual rainfall is about 430 mm,
and most rain falls between December and April. Mean annual temperature is about 22° C,

(HERDTFELDER
The Etosha region is flat with up to 500 m high dolomitic hills. The south margin of the Pan,
where the ciliate samples were taken, is dominated by rather young limestone tables. The Pan
has several inflows but no outflow. Its geological formation possibly evolved two to ten
million years ago, during the Pliocene epoch, when the Cunene River flowed into the Ekuma
Lake of which the Etosha Pan was an extension. Later, the Cunene River changed course
towards the Ruacana Falls in the west, thus cutting off the water supply of the lake. Dunng
the drying period, the soil of the pan became very brackish. Wind erosion deepened the
depression and in places impermeable clay up to 240 m deep formed on the floor.

Soils (Fig. 246-251, 255, 256): A soil map of the Etosha National Park has been published by
BUCH et al. (1994). They differentiate 26 types distributed over five main associations: soil
from deep (> 1 m) sandy substrates; shallow to moderately deep (< 1 m) sandy to sand-loamy
soils; shallow to moderately deep sandy-loamy to loamy-clayey soils from the fluvial sedi-
ments; and saline, sodium-rich soils. Of special interest are the alkaline (pH up to 10! see
sample descriptions in chapter 2.1.2) and saline (up to 130 %o) soils of the Solonchak and
Solonetz-type in the Pan and, especially, at the Pan margin. These vary conspicuously in
salinity seasonally, horizontally and vertically, providing an endless number of habitats for
soil microorganisms (detailed measurements, see sample descriptions in chapter 2.1.2,
HERDTFELDER 1984, and GANSSEN 1963). Indeed, about half of the ciliate species found in
these habitats were undescribed.
Vegetation (Fig. 1; 244, 252-261; and shortened text from BERRY 1982): Nine vegetation
types have been distinguished in the Etosha National Park. The following paragraphs provide
a brief description of the six types from which soil ciliate samples were taken.
Saline desert (Pan sensu stricto): During the rainy season, the Pan may be partially flooded,
most of the water coming from two rivers in the north. The Pan water is unfit for human or
animal consumption, as it may contain twice as much salt as sea-water. However, there are
many freshwater springs at the Pan margin. Nevertheless, it supports a rich growth of blue-
green algae, which in good rainy seasons attracts a million or more flamingos. When the
water dries up, little vegetation grows on the Pan, with exception of a specific halophytic
grass Sporobolus salsus. Areas adjoining the Pan have a very brackish soil and support only
halophytic vegetation such as the grasses, Sporobolus spicatus and Odyssea paucinervis, and
a small shrub, Suaeda articulata.
Dwarf shrub savannah: The fringes surrounding the Pan support a variety of small shrubs
such as Salsola etoschensis, Petalidium engleranum, Monechma genistifolium, Monechma
tonsum, Leucosphaera bainesii and Cyathula hereroensis which cover large areas of alkaline
soils. Acacia nebrownii and Aloe littoralis occur close to the edge of the Pan, and in the
vicinity of Salvadora.
Grasslands: These are mainly at the perimeter of the Pan on sandy soils overlying limestone.
Annual and perennial grasses are interspersed with clumps of Acacia nebrownii, Acacia
luederitzii var. luederitzii, Acacia reficiens sspec. reficiens and Catophractes alexandri. The
winter grazing areas, which sustain less palatable grasses, are the Halali plains, extending
from Charitsaub to Nuamses and Gemsbokvlakte, covering an area of almost 30.000 ha. The
dominant grass here is the perennial Monelytrum luederitzianum.
Thorn bush savannah: This vegetation type is dispersed throughout Etosha, close to the Pan,
on limestone and alkaline soils. The most common thorn tree species are water acacia (Acacia
nebrownii), bastard umbrella-thorn {Acacia luederitzii var. luederitzii), false umbrella-thorn
(Acacia reficiens sspec. reficiens), hook-thorn (Acacia mellifera sspec. detinens), candle
acacia (Acacia hebeclada) and umbrella-thorn (Acacia tortilis sspec. heteracantha) as well as
a few albizia (Albizia anthelmintica). Both the white-flowering "Gabbabos" or the rattle tree
(Catophractes alexandri) and the sickel-bush (Dichrostachys cinerea sspec. africana) often
form dense thickets. Good examples of the vegetation type can be seen on the road to
Gemsbokvlakte and on the fringe of the Pan near Namutoni, in the Okerfontein area.
Mopane savannah and woodland: The mopane, Colophospermum mopane, is the dominant
species of this veld type and also the most common tree in the Etosha National Park. It has
13

been estimated that 80% of all Etosha's trees are mopane. Typical mopane woodland occurs in
the Halali area where trees of 6 m and higher are common. This veld type is interspersed with
red bush-willow {Combretum apiculatum sspec. apiculatum), purple-pod terminalia {Termi-
nalia prunioides) and leadwood {Combretum imberbe).
Dolomite hills: Along the south-eastern and western borders of Etosha there is a ridge of
dolomite hills which rises sharply above the surrounding, flat bushveld. The low range near
Andersson entrance gate bears the picturesque name of "Ondundozonanandana" meaning "the
place to which the young calves went and from which they never returned" implying that the
hills are the haunt of leopards. The only hill of this type which is accessible to the tourist is
inside the Halali camp. The vegetation there, as well as on the nearby "Twee Koppies" (twin
hills), is typified by fat-stemmed moringo {Moringa ovalifolia), bird plum {Berchemia
discolor) and red bush-willow. Purple-pod terminalia mingle with yellow-bark acacia {Acacia
erubescens), scented thorn, sheperd's tree, common commiphora, and a few sour plum shrubs
{Ximenia americana). Four different Grewia species grow on the Halali Hill, as well as
sickle-bush and the climbing shrub Combretum mossambicense, which displays masses of
flowers in spring.
2.1.1.3 The Namib Desert and Namib Escarpment (Fig. 1, 2; 222-243)
The Namib Desert and its east margin, both famous for the high endemism of flora and fauna,
were one of the centres chosen for investigating soil ciliates. Thus, the region is described in
some detail, based on BARNARD (1998); for details on sampling sites (vegetation and soil
types, rainfall etc.), see site description in chapter 2.1.2. Further readings on details of climate,
soil, fauna and flora: CRAVEN & MARAIS (1992), FLETCHER & MARTIN (1948), GIESS (1989),
KAYSER (1973), LANCASTER & LANCASTER (1984), SCHOLZ (1968, 1972), SEELY (1988); see
also the comprehensive bibliography in BARNARD (1998). The following samples belong to
this area: 9-17, 19^48 (Fig. 2).
The combination of a cold, subantarctic upwelling on the Atlantic coast and a hot subtropical
interior have led to hyper-arid, bleak coastal conditions in the Namib Desert, similar to those
of Chile's Atacama Desert and of Baya California, Mexico. The zone between cold sea and
hot desert is narrow. A thin stripe of coastal fog, seldom reaching more than 30 km inland,
frequently blows over the hyper-arid coast and sustains life there in the absence of rainfall.
The Namib as a geo-ecological zone extends about 2000 km from the Carunjamba River in
Angola to the Olifants River in South Africa. Bounded sharply in the west by the Atlantic
coast, its eastern reaches (Namib Escarpment) are ill-defined. The Namib reaches 80 to 200
km inland, roughly coinciding with the 100-mm annual rainfall line, that is, the 1000 m
altitude contour line, or the Namib Escarpment. It covers about 15% of Namibia's land area.
There are three desert landforms: (1) the Southern Namib, with spectacular "dune sea" and
"islands" of black outcrops and inselbergs; (2) the Central Namib, with gravel plains between
the Ugab and Kuiseb Rivers; (3) the Northern Namib, with rugged mountains and dune fields
reaching northwards into Angola (no samples were taken from this part).
The succulent steppe in the Southern Namib (Lüderitz and south) is fed by winter rainfall and
is a hot-spot of plant diversity dominated by succulent shrubs of the family Mesembry-
anthemaceae. Perennial grasses such as Stipagrostis sabulicola characterize the Namib mobile
dunes, while annual herbs and grasses including other Stipagrostis species occur on the gravel
14

plains of the Central Namib. The Namib Escarpment is a narrow, sometimes poorly defined
transition zone between the desert and the central highland plateau. Thus, it is termed a semi-
desert savannah transition zone. Many unique, Namibian endemic vertebrates, invertebrates
and plants are found in this zone, which also harbours many relics from wetter periods in the
past.
The Namib is widely called the world's oldest desert. Today, the major centres of endemism
are not in the tropical northeast, but in the arid northwest escarpment and southern winter-
rainfall zone. There is ample evidence that the Namib has been semi-arid to arid for at least 55
and possibly up to 80 million years, while the Benguela Current was forced northward along
the southwest African coast only about 5-10 million years ago. The slow continental breakup
of west Gondwana, 130-145 million years ago, set the conditions for the regions's aridity, by
shifting southern Africa to its present position, astride the Tropic of Capricorn, and slowly
readjusting adjacent marine currents and prevailing winds. In effect, the region has been an
island of aridity in a "sea" of more changeable climes.
2.1.1.4 Savannahs (Fig. 1, 2)
Most of Namibia is covered by savannah, especially thorny shrub and tree savannah. The
dwarf shrub and succulent savannah of the south is of the Karoo type and a regional centre of
endemism (BARNARD 1998). The Hottentot term Karoo is given to barren (treeless) tracts in
South Africa, consisting of extensive elevated plateaus with a clayey soil, which during the
dry season are entirely waterless and arid. Mountain, Thornbush and Highland Savannahs
dominate the central highlands, while Mopane Savannah surrounds Etosha in the north.
Savannahs grow on Lithosoils (BARNARD 1998), which are red and deep when old (terra
rossa), while brown, flat and stony when more recent (terra fusca); further, grey, clayey soils
develop in depressions (SCHOLZ 1968a). Lithosoils are poor in plant nutrients and humus and
thus very sensitive and rather unproductive (GANSSEN 1963, GANSSEN & MOLL 1961).
However, they are frequently covered with a rather thick litter layer providing rich and
diverse habitats for soil microorganisms and mesofauna.
Many of our samples belong to this biome type in one way or the other: highland savannah
(nos. 1, 72, 73), dwarf shrub savannah ~ Karoo (2-8, 18), Mopane savannah (49-52), and
some samples from the Etosha National Park, viz., the thorny shrub and mopane savannah
(55, 56, 62, 63, 64, 66). Furthermore, many samples from the Namib Escarpment are associ-
ated with this biome type.

where.
Site 10 (Fig. 225): Southern Namib Desert and succulent steppe in the surroundings of the
town of Lüderitz (26°40'S 15°10'E); Atlantic coast, Flamingo Bay. Soil very sandy and
covered with a thin layer of filamentous green algae or cyanobacteria. Material collected:
litter, roots of halophytes, and sand with algal cover; pH 7.5, highly saline (> 20%o). Number
of species identified: 1; total number of species: 1. Remarks: annual rain fall 0-50 mm;
collected on 16.02.1994, investigated on 03.11.1994. This sample probably contained too
much salt; repeated change of the soil solution (water) did not alter the result.
Site 11 (Fig. 226, 227): Southern Namib Desert and succulent steppe in the Great Bay at the
town of Lüderitz, about 1 km inshore from the Atlantic sea coast, in the area of the "living
stones", a special kind of succulent plants that look like stones (26°40'S 15°10'E). Material
collected: crust soil, mainly a thin algal layer, from small (5-20 cm) quartz stones and small,
humous sand aggregates from the margin of the stones. The quartz stones are transparent and
thus a rather rich algal flora ("window" flora; RUMRICH et al. 1989) can develop on the stone
surface which is embedded in the sand; water is provided by fog condensing on the stones; pH
7.2, highly saline (20%o). Number of species identified: 17, of these 4 described as new in this
book; number of unidentified species: 2; total number of species: 19. Remarks: annual rainfall
0-50 mm; collected on 17.02.1994, investigated on 27.06.1994. A rich ciliate fauna consid-
ering the poorness of the habitat and the extreme salinity. Soil percolate was changed several
times because the sample soon became putrid, and to stimulate growth of ciliates at lower salt
concentrations; furthermore, small quantities of the dry sample were suspended in distilled
water. Only 2 of the 4 new species have their type location here.
Site 12: As in site 11. Material collected: litter and small stones sieved off sand accumulated
around cushion plants plus plant roots with a thick mantle of sand and peeled epidermal cells;
pH 6.2, highly saline (15%o). Number of species identified: 18, of these 3 described as new in
this book; number of unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 18. Remarks: annual
17

rainfall 0-50 mm; collected on 17.02.1994, investigated on 11.10.1999. Protospathidium
serpens with thick oral bulge, as described in the Antarctic population (FOISSNER 1996a).
Sample became putrid, and thick iron-moulds developed two weeks after rewetting; thus soil
solution was replaced by fresh tap water. The 2 new species have their type location else-
where.
Site 13: Namib Escarpment in the desert and succulent steppe between the towns of Goageb
and Aus, that is, at main road to the town of Lüderitz (26°40'S 16°50'E); semi-desert and
savannah transition. Material collected: litter, roots and red soil between and under large
cushions (about lxlm) of Euphorbia sp.; pH 6.5. Number of species identified: 16, of these
1 described a new in this book; number of unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 16.
Remarks: annual rainfall 50-100 mm; collected on 16.12.1994, investigated on 02.08.1999.
Micronucleus oiColpoda edaphoni as conspicuous as in type population.

(20%o). Number of species identified: 5, of these 1 described as new in this book; number of
unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 5. Remarks: annual rain fall 0-50 mm;
collected on 17.02.1994, investigated on 13.10.1994. The percolating soil water was replaced
by tap water one week after rewetting to reduce salt concentration, whereupon Rostrophrya
namibiensis maldivensis and Colpoda ecaudata appeared. The new species has its type loca-
tion elsewhere.
Site 15: Escarpment of the southern Namib Desert, Sinclair Guest Farm, about 50 km north-
west of the town of Helmeringhausen (25°40'S 16°20'E); semi-desert and savannah transition.
Material collected: litter and soil between tree branches and pieces of the thick, fibrous bark
of four camel-thorn trees {Acacia erioloba); pH 5.2. Number of species identified: 21, of these
0 described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 0; total number of species:
21. Remarks: annual rainfall 100-150 mm; collected on 18.02.1994, investigated on
01.10.1999. The smooth variety of Nivaliella plana occurs. Amphisiella magnigranulosa
small and posteriorly not narrowed.
Site 16: Dry roadside ditch at main road between the towns of Aus and Helmeringhausen at
the escarpment of the southern Namib Desert (26°20'S 16°25'E); semi-desert and savannah
transition. Material collected: litter, roots, and 0-2 cm mud and sand layer of the ditch; pH
6.2. Number of species identified: 30, of these 3 described as new in this book; number of
unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 30. Remarks: annual rainfall 50-100 mm;
collected on 18.02.1994, investigated on 31.05.1999. Soil solution (water) replaced by tap
water one week after rewetting because of mass development of bacteria. Urosomoida ant-
arctica has only 5-6 transverse and pretransverse cirri, while the type population has 7.
Gonostomum affine has ellipsoidal cortical granules and lacks transverse cirri, indicating that
it is a new species; but the matter is complicated (FOISSNER et al. 2001). The new species
have their type location elsewhere. Hemimastix amphikineta FOISSNER et al., 1988 occurs.
Site 17: Sand dune at the escarpment of the southern Namib Desert between the towns of Aus
and Helmeringhausen (26°05'S 16°35'E); semi-desert and savannah transition; dune over-
grown by the dune grass Stipagrostis sp. and nicely populated by a variety of insects, espe-
cially tenebrionids. Material collected: plant remnants and roots sieved off the sand around
Stipagrostis shrubs at a depth of 0-10 cm; ph 5.4. Number of species identified: 17, of these 2
described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 2; total number of species: 19.

18

Soil solution replaced by tap water three weeks after rewetting, whereupon the 2 new species
developed. Hemimastix amphikineta FoiSSNER et al., 1988 occurs.
Site 18: Wet soil from around a pond in the dwarf shrub savannah near the town of Maltahöhe
(24°55'S 16°55'E); soil dark and anoxic below 2 cm. Material collected: litter, roots, and 0-2

number of species: 12. Remarks: annual rainfall 150-200 mm; collected on 19.02.1994,
investigated on 16.11.1994. A really extreme biotope where 2 new species were found, of
which 1 has its type location in the USA. In vivo, Semiplatyophrya foissneri looks rather
different to the original figure; thus, it will be redescribed later.
Site 19: Southern Namib Desert, small pan in southwest area of the Sossus Vlei (24°50'S
15°20'E). Material collected: upper 0-3 cm soil layer, that is, yellowbrown clay without any
recognizable organic residues or roots; pH 6.3. Number of species identified: 2, of these 0
described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 2.
Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm; collected on 20.02.1994, investigated on 15.03.1999. A
very poor sample; no further species appeared when it was enriched with a few crushed wheat
grains after three weeks.
Site 20: Southern Namib Desert, southwest region of Sossus Vlei (24°50'S 15°20'E). Material
collected: plant residues, clay, and sand agglomerated during the last flood of the vlei; pH 7.O.

fied species: 0; total number of species: 15. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm; collected on
20.02.1994, investigated on 25.07.1994. Colpoda maupasi, E. augustini, and Peranema sp.
became very numerous three weeks after rewetting. The new species has its type location
elsewhere.
Site 21 (Fig. 228): Southern Namib Desert, Death Vlei, that is, a vlei no longer flooded by the
river, which changed the bed (24°50'S 15°20'E). Material collected: upper 0-3 cm soil layer,
that is, yellowbrown clay without any recognizable organic residues or roots; pH 6.2. Number
of species identified: 2, of these 0 described as new in this book; number of unidentified
species: 0; total number of species: 2. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm; collected on
20.02.1994, investigated on 15.03.1999. A very extreme biotope without any green plants.
The 2 species found, are r-selected colpodids. The sample was enriched with some crushed
wheat grains three weeks after rewetting, but no further species developed.
Site 22 (Fig. 228): As in site 21. Material collected: pieces of decaying bark and wood from
dead camel-thorn trees {Acacia erioloba); pH 6.2. Number of species identified: 7, of these 0
described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 7.
Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm; collected on 20.02.1994, investigated on 19.10.1998.
Lamtostyla islandica 70-120 urn long, that is, larger than the specimens from type popula-
tion; nuclear apparatus and infraciliature, however, typical.
Site 23 (Fig. 229-231): Southern Namib Desert, centre of Sossus Vlei (24°50'S 15°20'E).
Material collected: plant remnants sieved off the sand under Nara shrubs; pH 7.7; moderately
saline. Number of species identified: 26, of these 5 described as new in this book; number of
unidentified species: 1; total number of species: 27. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm;
collected on 20.02.1994, investigated on 29.03.1994. This rather rich sample contained 5 new
19

species, of which 2 have their type location here. Circinella filiformis might be a distinct sub-
species because the ventral cirral row is about twice as long as in the Austrian type.
Site 24: As in site 23. Material collected: sieved litter and humous sand under a camel-thorn
tree {Acacia erioloba), up to a depth of 15 cm. Number of species identified: 21, of these 4
described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 21.
Remarks: annual rain fall 0-50 mm; collected on 20.02.1994, investigated on 18.12.1998. A
rather rich sample with several new species, 2 of which have their type location here. The
smooth variety of Nivaliella plana occurs.
Site 25: As in site 23. Material collected: dusty bark of camel-thom trees {Acacia erioloba);
pH 6.4. Number of species identified: 2, of these 1 described as new in this book; number of
unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 2. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm;
collected on 20.04.1994, investigated on 21.12.1998. Soil percolate was replaced by tap water
after one week because bacteria became very numerous. Nudiamphisiella interrupta repro-
duced strongly. The new species has its type location here.
Site 26 (Fig. 232): Southern Namib Desert, dune 45 at road to the Sossus Vlei (24°50'S
15°30'E). Material collected: Stipagrostis and shrub remnants sieved off the sand, sample
composed of about 80% plant residues and 20% sand; pH 6.2. Number of species identified:
31, of these 3 described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 3; total number
of species: 34. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm; collected on 20.02.1994, investigated on
06.07.1998. Ciliates were very numerous six days after rewetting the sample, especially
Pedohymena australiensis, Nivaliella plana (both the smooth and ribbed variety), and
Spathidium namibicola. This and the fairly high number of species show that ciliates may
play an important role in the energy cycle of Namibian sand dunes. Pseudoholophrya terri-
cola has rod-shaped extrusomes, as described originally. The new species have their type
location elsewhere.
Site 27 (Fig. 233): Escarpment of the southern Namib Desert, small dune about 23 km west of
the main gate in Sesrim village, near the road over the Sesrim Canyon (24°30'S 15°50'E);
semi-desert and savannah transition; dune rather densely overgrown with Stipagrostis.

granules. Extrusomes of Dileptus terrenus very similar to those of —» D. mucronatus. One of
the 5 new species has its type location here. A rare, conspicuous flagellate occurred: Tetra-
dimorpha sp.
Site 30 (Fig. 236): As in site 28; near end of Aubschlucht, at the so-called Riedloch, a small,
pond-like inflation of the stream in the centre of the Aubschlucht. Material collected: 0-10 cm
soil layer from around the pond, which is surrounded by sedges and Ficus trees; soil dark,
very humous, with much litter and some roots; pH 7.7. Number of species identified: 65, of
these 7 described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 3, of these 1 likely
undescribed (new); total number of species: 68. Remarks: annual rainfall 150-200 mm;
collected on 21.02.1994, investigated on 02.11.1994. A very rich sample with many rare and
new species. Bryophyllum loxophylliforme with about 10 macronuclear nodules. Extrusomes
of Pseudoholophrya terricola rod-shaped, as in type population. Extrusomes of Spathidium
anguilla fusiform, macronucleus, however, a tortuous strand. Three of the 7 new species have
their type location here.
Site 31 (Fig. 237, 238): Central Namib Desert, at road margin between Welwitschia drive and
Bloedkoppie, about 100 km east of Swakopmund (22°45'S 15°25'E); a very meagre, tree-less
region with few plants. Material collected: litter and 0-2 cm soil layer under Welwitschia
shrubs and decaying blossoms from a succulent shrub; pH 6.4; slightly saline (5%o). Number
of species identified: 27, of these 5 described as new in this book; number of unidentified
species: 0; total number of species: 27. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm; colleted on
22.02.1994, investigated on 04.05.1998. A rather rich sample containing 4 of the new species
described in this book. Lamtostyla islandica has only 1-2 transverse cirri. Extrusomes of
Enchelys terrenum exactly as in type population. Colpoda maupasi become numerous 10 days
after rewetting the sample. Only 1 of the 5 new species has its type location here.
Site 32 (Fig. 237, 238): Central Namib Desert, Welwitschia Plain (drive), about 80 km east of
Swakopmund (22°40'S 15°15'E); a treeless area containing a rather high number of
Welwitschia mirabilis individuals; soil poor, that is, a mixture of sand, gravel, and
Welwitschia litter. Material collected: decaying leaves from Welwitschia trunks; pH 5.4.
Number of species identified: 15, of these 1 described as new in this book; number of uniden-
tified species: 0; total number of species: 15. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm; collected on
22.02.1994, investigated on 08.12.1998. The smooth variety of Nivaliella plana occurs. When
we visited the site again in January 2001, many shrubs and plants were flowering. The new
species has its type location elsewhere.
Site 33: Escarpment of central Namib Desert, about 20 km north of the village of Solitaire
(23°50'S 16°E); semi-desert and savannah transition; a beautiful dune rich in plant debris and
insects at west margin of main road. Material collected: organic debris and living roots of
Stipagrostis sp. (dune grass) sieved off the sand to a depth of 10 cm; pH 7.6, slightly saline
(5-10%o). Number of species identified: 47, of these 7 described as new in this book; number
of unidentified species: 2, all likely undescribed (new); total number of species: 49. Remarks:
21

annual rainfall 50-100 mm; collected on 22.02.1994, investigated on 29.03.1994. A rich
sample containing 7 of the new species described in this book; 4 of them even have their type
location here, and the 2 unidentified species are also very likely undescribed, including a new
colpodid genus. Unfortunately, these 3 rare species were not recognized in vivo and thus
cannot be described. All 9 new species occurred a week after rewetting the sample! Later,
diversity significantly decreased, possibly due to the intense sampling at day 7.
Further remarkable observations: The sample contains two "typical" freshwater species, viz.,
Cinetochilum margaritaceum and Chilodonella uncinata, which are rare in soil, especially the
latter. The protargol preparations show that they are morphologically indistinguishable from
the European freshwater strains, as described and illustrated in FOISSNER et al. (1991, 1994).
Protospathidium arenicola and Spathidium procerum are easily confused in vivo, but distinct
in the protargol slides due to the different shape of the circumoral kinety. Likewise, Para-
gonqstomum rarisetum and P. binucleatum are easily confused, even in the protargol prepara-
tions. One of the unidentified species has the same size, shape, and nuclear apparatus as -»
Apoenchelys bamforthi, but possesses a distinct circumoral kinety and thus belongs to
Enchelyodonl Another remarkable species is Pleuroplitoides smithi FoiSSNER, 1996a, a rare
species found in Namibia only in this sample; small individuals are easily confused with ->
Diplites arenicola).
Site 34 (Fig. 237, 238): As in site 32. Material collected: dry, decaying Welwitschia leaves;
pH 5.4. Number of species identified: 13, of these 0 described as new in this book; number of
unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 13. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm;
collected on 22.02.1994, investigated on 18.12.1998. The water added for rewetting became a
dark-brown, bacteria-rich soup and was thus replaced by tap water on days 7 and 20. Colpoda
steinii was covered by epicortical bacteria. Lamtostyla australis was numerous and as
described by BLATTERER & FOISSNER (1988). Exocolpoda augustini became very numerous
seven days after rewetting the sample.

Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50 mm; collected on 22.02.1994, investigated on 14.11.1998. The
water added for wetting became a dark-brown, bacteria-rich soup and was thus replaced by
tap water on day 2.
Site 36 (Fig. 239): Central Namib Desert, "Moon landscape" near the river oasis Goanikontes,
about 25 km east of the town of Swakopmund (22°40'S 14°45'E); a very meagre basaltic (?)
landscape with only a few grasses, ground however covered by a thin, greenish layer of
lichens and algae because the region is heavily influenced by the Atlantic fog. Material
collected: greenish crust soil as described above from small and large gravel; pH 6.0, moder-
ately saline (10%o). Number of species identified: 8, of these 2 described as new in this book;
number of unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 8. Remarks: annual rainfall 0-50
mm; collected on 22.02.1994, investigated on 27.12.1999. The water added for rewetting
became a brown, gelatinous soup and was thus replaced by tap water on day 3. Two new
species occurred at this extreme site, 1 has its type location here. In January 2001, the site was
drier and looked poorer. One of the 2 new species has its type location here.
Site 37: Central Namib Desert, about 40 km north of the town of Swakopmund (22°10'S

investigated on 14.12.1999. Soil solution (water) replaced by tap water on days 3 and 20 after
rewetting the sample because it soon became a darkbrown, mucous soup. Gonostomum affine
unusual because it has highly refractile cortical granules about 1 x 0.5 (am in size and lacks
transverse cirri. Extrusomes of Pseudoholophrya terricola rod-shaped, as in type population.
Sorogena stoianovitchae easily recognized by the typical body shape and oral dome; soro-
carps not observed; fed exclusively on Colpoda elliotti. Macronucleus of Epispathidium
ascendens as in type population, that is, tortuous at ends, straight in mid-region. The new
species has its type location elsewhere.
Site 41 (Fig. 241): As in site 40; granitic rock-pools partially covered with grasses (e.g., Apo-
nogeton desertorum) and/or containing conspicuous branchiopods. Material collected: mud
and grass roots from deep, dry rock-pools; pH 5.8. Number of species identified: 55, of these
6 described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 1; total number of species:
56. Remarks: annual rainfall 50-100 mm; collected on 24.02.1994, investigated on
16.02.2000. A rich sample containing 6 of the new species described in this monograph. Both
the smooth and ribbed variety of Nivaliella plana occur. The extrusomes of —> Trachelo-
phyllum apiculatum are simple, about 10 urn long rods, and the mucilaginous cortical layer is
very inconspicuous. Halteria grandinella often has three bristles posteriorly, resembling
Pelagohalteria. Circinella filiformis deviates rather distinctly from the Austrian type: fronto-
ventral row longer, two cirri left of frontoventral row, buccal cirrus composed of four cilia,
micronuclei distinctly ellipsoidal. The unidentified species is likely a new colpodid genus.
Two of the 6 new species have their type location here.

book. Both the smooth and ribbed variety of Nivaliella plana occur. Gonostomum kuehnelti
has, like the type population, four transverse cirri in quadrangular pattern. Left polykinetid of
Bresslaua insidiatrix composed of 10-12 kineties. Dileptus americanus has two size-types of
extrusomes: type 1 rod-shaped, 5-6 urn long and rather thick; type 2 rod-shaped, 2 urn long

from Cyphostemma currorii trees plus some soil from in between tree branches; pH 5.1.
Number of species identified: 19, of these 0 described as new in this book; number of uniden-
tified species: 0; total number of species: 19. Remarks: annual rainfall 150-200 mm; collected
on 25.02.1994, investigated on 14.12. 1999. Soil solution became slightly putrid after one
week and was thus replaced by tap water. Sample was kept rather dry three and four weeks
after rewetting, but only 1 further species developed (Platyophrya vorax). Colpoda maupasi
reached high numbers in the fourth week.
Site 47: Escarpment of the central Namib Desert, Omaruru River, where it crosses the main
road between Spitzkoppe and the village of Unis Myn (21°25'S 15°05'E); semi-desert and
savannah transition. Material collected: bark from a large Combretum imberbe (leadwood)

fied species: 2, of these 1 likely undescribed (new); total number of species: 45. Remarks:
annual rainfall 100-150 mm; collected on 26.02.1994, investigated on 17.03.2000. A rich
sample with many rare and new species. The smooth variety of Nivaliella plana occurs. The
extrusomes of Pseudoholophrya terricola are rod-shaped, as in the type population. Although
numerous, Opercularia curvicaule did not form colonies. Two of the 4 new species have their
type location here.
Site 49: Bambatsi Guest Farm between the towns of Khorixas and Outjo, 1150 m above sea-
level (20°10'S 15°25'E); Mopane savannah. Material collected: dark grey mud and 0-2 cm
soil layer, grass roots, and the orange and green algal cover from dry and wet puddles of roads
within the farm; pH 6.7, not saline. Number of species identified: 126, of these 34 (!)

scribed (new); total number of species: 141. Remarks: annual rainfall 250-300 mm; collected
on 27.02.1994, investigated on 27.12.1999. The richest sample in the whole collection and
that we ever had with many new and rare species. As the other samples from this region are
also rich, the area is a local diversity centre. When we revisited the site in January 2001, all
puddles were filled with sand and gravel because the roads had been upgraded. Thus, the type
location of the new species found there disappeared. This population of Plagiocampa penta-
dactyla also has epicortical bacteria. A red and a red-blue variety of Blepharisma steini occur.
Site 50: As in site 49; alluvial grassland within the Colophospermum mopane forest sur-

15°50'E); small salt bush (Suaeda articulata) island very near to the pan margin. Soil classifi-
cation according to BUCH et al. (1994): (Hyper) calcaric Regosol - (Hyper) calcaric Arenosols
- Haplic Calcisols (petrocalcic phase) from calcareous sediments above Etosha Limestone and
Andoni Sand-/Siltstone. Soil in collection area is a loamy sand mixed with plant debris and
covered by a thin layer of cyanobacteria. Material collected: litter and 0-5 cm soil layer; pH
8.9, highly saline (18%o). Number of species identified: 20, of these 6 described as new in this
book; number of unidentified species: 2, of these 1 likely undescribed (new); total number of
species: 22. Remarks: annual rainfall 350-400 mm; collected on 28.02.1994, investigated on
01.08.1994. Water-hole dry at collection time.

about 500 m off pan margin; pH 8.0, highly saline (15%o). Number of species identified: 53,
of these 16 (!) described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 4, of these 2
likely undescribed (new); total number of species: 57. An outstanding sample containing 16
new species and subspecies, of which 5 have their type location here. Remarks: annual rain-
fall 350-400 mm; collected on 28.02.1994, investigated on 25.07.1994.
Site 55 (Fig. 244): Etosha National Park - Ghost tree (Moringa ovalifolia) forest (19°S
15°40'E). Material collected: paper-like bark and decaying wood from living and dead
Moringa trees; pH 6.7, moderately saline. Number of species identified: 11, of these 1
described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 0; total number of species: 11.
Remarks: annual rainfall 350-400 mm; collected on 28.02.1994, investigated on 01.08.1994.
The curious Vorticella (Echinovorticella) echini occurs in this habitat. The new subspecies
has its type location here.
Site 56 (Fig. 244): As in site 55. Soil classification according to BUCH et al. (1994): (Lithi)
Eutric/(Calcaric) Fluvisoils - Calcaric Regosols - Lithi/Rendzic Leptosols above/from Etosha
Limestone. Soil at collection site grey and dust-like, very hard. Material collected: litter, grass
roots, and soil from 0-5 cm; pH 7.8, slightly saline (< 10%o). Number of species identified:
55, of these 10 described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 4, of these 1
likely undescribed (new); total number of species: 59. Remarks: annual rainfall 350-400 mm;
collected on 28.02.1994, investigated on 29.03.1994. A rich sample, in spite of the meagre
appearance of the soil. Ilsiella palustris (conspicuously egg-shaped), Maryna antarctica
(length around 40 urn), and M. minima were already active 7h after rewetting, but encysted
after about 20h! Enchelyodon nodosus as in population II described by BERGER et al. (1984).
Five of the 10 new species have their type location here.
The following samples (57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63) are a transect extending from the pan to the
Colophospermum mopane forest. There is a strong gradient in all parameters, such as plant
communities and soil salinity. Likewise, strong vertical gradients occur, as evident from
salinity measurements in a hill around a Suaeda bush: 0-1 cm depth 130%o, 1-3 cm 55%o, 3-5
cm 18%o, 5-10 cm 8%, 10-20 cm 8%o. Obviously, salt accumulates in the upper 5 cm soil
layer due to the strong evaporation. Soil classification according to BUCH et al. (1994) for
sites 57-62: (Gleyi) - Verti - (Hyper) calcari (Hyper) salic Fluvisols above Andoni Sand-
/Siltstone. Vegetation, see figure 1. A lot of new species occur in these samples, especially in
the saline habitats. Certainly, there are many more!

Site 57 (Fig. 245-251): Etosha National Park - lookout site "Pan" (19°10'S 15°55'E); about
100 m inside the pan, which was dry on the surface but wet underneath. The pan is a saline
desert sparsely grown with grass {Sporobolus salsus) and partially covered with a thin layer of
cyanobacteria. The pan soil is a particular mixture of clay, lime, and salt having a pH around
9; when dry, the mass is like a stone, but doubles its volume and becomes a fluffy pancake
when saturated with water (Fig. 250, 251). The surface of the non-flooded Petri dish cultures
was covered by a mat of filamentous and coccal cyanobacteria, providing an ideal biotope for
cyanobacteria-feeding ciliates (Fig. 247-249). Material collected: soil and grass roots from 0-
20 cm plus scraping from the soil surface with the cyanobacterial crust; pH 8.7, highly saline
(15%o). Number of species identified: 34, of these 11 described as new in this book; number
of unidentified species: 2, of these 1 likely undescribed (a new Sikorops with monilate macro-
nucleus and conspicuous bulge); total number of species: 36. Remarks: annual rainfall 350-
400 mm; collected on 01.03.1994, investigated on 09.05.1994. A considerable number of
species, of which 11 (!) are described as new in this book, considering the extremity of the
biotope. Oxytricha granulifera quadricirrata contained pieces of filamentous cyanobacteria in
the food vacuoles. Only 3 of the 11 new species have their type location here.

01.03.1994, investigated on 30.05.1994. Bresslaua insidiatrix and Colpoda orientalis exactly
as described in FoiSSNER (1993c).
Site 64: Etosha National Park - Aus water-hole (19°10'S 16°10'E); waterhole dry and over-
grown with grasses, some sedges and limestone blocs in centre. Material collected: litter,
roots, and soil from 0-5 cm in central area of water-hole; pH 6.3, slightly saline (0.5%o).
Number of species identified: 36, of these 2 described as new in this book; number of uniden-
tified species: 4, of these 2 likely undescribed (new); total number of species: 40. Remarks:
annual rainfall 400-450 mm; collected on 01.03.1994, investigated on 21.12.1998. Although
there was considerable growth of filamentous cyanobacteria in the rewetted sample, only 2
nassulids developed. Protospathidium serpens as described by FOISSNER (1996a) from Ant-
arctica. Two varieties of Spathidium claviforme occur: one as described by FoiSSNER (1987b)
and a more slender, almost cylindroidal form with 4 urn long extrusomes and about 10 ciliary
rows. One of the 2 new species has its type location here.
Site 65 (Fig. 260, 261): Etosha National Park - road to the Halali rest camp (18°55'S
16°25'E); small, saline pan with many nice halophyte shrubs and grass in between. Soil classi-
fication according to BUCH et al. (1994): Calcaric Fluvisols - Calcaric Regosols above Etosha
Limestone and Calcrete. Soil loamy and covered with a green algal crust at collection site.
Material collected: litter, algal crust, grass and shrub roots, and soil from 0-10 cm; pH 8.0,
extremely saline (20%o). Number of species identified: 36, of these 7 described as new in this
28

book; number of unidentified species: 4, of these 1 likely undescribed (new); total number of
species: 40. Remarks: annual rainfall 400-450 mm; collected on 01.03.1994, investigated on
30.05.1994. Although extremely saline, a rich sample containing 7 of the new species
described in this book. Holosticha stueberi lacks distinct transverse cirri and has 7-9 dorsal
kineties, indicating that it might be a distinct subspecies. Pseudoplatyophrya saltans distinctly
jumps, but has the cortex as deeply furrowed as Grossglockneria hyalina.
Site 66: Etosha National Park - Halali rest camp (19°S 16°30'E); dolomitic rock-pools
between Moringa ovalifolia trees on a dolomitic Inselberg in the camp. Material collected:
leaf litter and soil-like mud from bottom of rock-pools; pH 7.2. Number of species identified:
16, of these 1 described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 0; total number
of species: 16. Remarks: annual rainfall 400-450 mm; collected on 01.03.1994, investigated
on 25.07.1994. This is a rather low number of ciliate species for such a biotope, possibly
because the mud is full of rotifers, several of which are fully active a few minutes after rewet-
ting the sample; indeed, when these species are air-dried on a slide in a drop of water, they
become active again within a few minutes after water is added; this game can be repeated
several times! KOSTE (1996) identified 24 rotifer species in this sample, including 4 new
species: Dissotrocha decembullata n. sp., D. hertzogi aculeata n. ssp., Otostephanus jersabeki
n. sp., and Philodina foissneri n. sp. As concern ciliates, -> Wolfkosia loeffleri is remarkable
because this curious species was known only from the Costa Rican type location.
Site 67: Etosha National Park - lookout "Etosha" (18°50'S 16°30'E); Sporobolus girdle about
1 km off pan margin. Soil classification according to BUCH et al. (1994): (Psammi)

tified species: 5, of these 3 likely undescribed (new); total number of species: 24. Remarks:
annual rainfall 400-450 mm; collected on 02.03.1994, investigated on 13.05.1994. A con-
spicuous number of species, including many new ones, considering the extremity (pH 9.7) of
the habitat! Four of the 7 new species have their type location here.
Site 68: As in site 67. Material collected: dry algal crust as described at site 67; pH 9.4,
extremely saline (> 20%o). Number of species identified: 2, of these 1 described as new in this
book; number of unidentified species: 0, total number of species: 2. Remarks: annual rainfall
400-450 mm; collected on 02.03.1994, investigated on 01.08.1994. Only bacteria developed
during the first week after rewetting; thus, the highly saline run-off was replaced by tap water,
whereupon 2 species appeared. The new species has its type location elsewhere.
Site 69: Etosha National Park - Okerfontein water-hole (18°45'S 16°45'E); swamp around

not saline.

spp.) and grass (Sporobolus spp.) girdle near the toilet. Soil classification, see site 69. Mate-
rial collected: litter with cyanobacteria crusts, roots, and soil up to 5 cm depth; pH 8.4, highly
saline (15%o). Number of species identified: 69, of these 17 described as new in this book;
number of unidentified species: 6, of these 1 likely undescribed (new); total number of
species: 75. Remarks: annual rainfall 450-500 mm; a very rich sample containing 15 of the
new species described in this book! Two of the 17 new species have their type location here.

nitrate preparations. Collected on 2.3.1994, investigated 1.8.1994.

7.6, extremely saline (20%o). Number of species identified: 10, of these 2 described as new in
this book; number of unidentified species: 2, both likely undescribed; total number of species:
12. Remarks: annual rainfall 450-500 mm; collected on 02.03.1994, identified on 30.05.1994.
Sample became a bacteria/nematode soup after three weeks.
Site 72: Windhoek, Daan Viljoen Game Park (22°35'S 17°05'E). Material collected: bark
from a camel-thorn tree (Acacia erioloba) in the highland savannah; pH 5.4. Number of
species identified: 14, of these 0 described as new in this book; number of unidentified
species: 0; total number of species: 14. Remarks: annual rainfall 350-400 mm; collected on
04.03.1994, investigated on 02.08.1999. Colpoda steinii has a conspicuous preoral bulge;
such a variety was observed also in Venezuela and might be a distinct subspecies. The macro-
nucleus oi Plagiocampa difficilis has a central nucleolus, as in the type population. The ribbed
variety of Nivaliella plana occurs.
Site 73: As in site 72; granitic rock-pools in a stream below the dam. Material collected: dry
and moist mud from rock-pools; pH 6.2. Number of species identified: 35, of these 6
described as new in this book; number of unidentified species: 6, of these 4 likely undescribed

described in this book, 3 of them have their type location here.
2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Sampling and Sample Processing
The material collected usually included mineral top soil (0-5 cm, rarely up to 10 cm depth)
with fine plant roots, the humic layer, and the deciduous and/or grass litter from the soil sur-
face. In soil with few organic materials and very sandy habitats, especially in the Namib
Desert, litter was sieved off the sand with an ordinary kitchen sieve (1 mm mesh-size), so that
the final sample consisted of about 80% litter and 20% sand and gravel. Usually, 10 small
subsamples were collected with a small shovel from an area of about 100 m2 and mixed to a
composite sample. Bark samples were usually taken from one to three trees. The bark was
30

collected with a knife, selecting for regions grown with mosses or lichens and/or containing
some soil.
Generally, a "good" sample consists of 50% litter, humus and roots and 50% mineral soil. The
litter and humus are very important because they release many nutrients when the sample is
rewetted, stimulating growth of bacteria, fungi, flagellates, and amoebae, that is, the main
food of ciliates. The nutrient increase obviously decouples microbiostasis, as explained in
FOISSNER (1997d).
All samples were air-dried for at least one month and then sealed in plastic bags. Such
samples can be stored for years without any significant loss of species, provided they are from
arid or temperate environments (FOISSNER 1997d). This is emphasized by the present investi-
gations: there is no correlation between storage time and species number; indeed, the richest
samples (nos. 4,49) are those stored for over four years (details, see chapter 3.1.1).
All collections were analysed with the "non-flooded Petri dish method", as described by
FOISSNER (1987d, 1992). The technique is not perfect, but likely the best available for bio-
diversity assessment of soil ciliates at large (for details, see chapter 3.1.1). The protocol is
simple (Fig. 262).
1. Put the material in a Petri dish and spread over the bottom of the dish in at least a 1 cm,
better 2 to 3 cm thick layer. As concerns the Namibian samples, sufficient material was
available to fill a 2 cm high Petri dish 13 cm across or, rarely, a 3 cm high dish 18 cm in
diameter. Basically, a large Petri dish (18 cm) is preferable because it provides more
material for preparations.
2. Slightly over-saturate but do not flood the sample with distilled water. Water should be
added to the sample until 5-20 ml will drain off when the Petri dish is tilted (45°) and the
soil gently pressed with a finger. Complete saturation takes up to 12 hours, so check
cultures after this time. Never flood the sample, that is make an Aufguss ("infusion")
because then only a few common species will develop. Further, the material should have
been dry for at least one month.
3. Cover Petri dish and pinch a clip between bottom and lid to enable gas exchange.
Generally, care must be taken that samples do not putrefy. This happens rather easily with
saline material, soil containing animal excrements or, in "ordinary" samples, if the litter is
very easily decomposable. In this case, change the water in the sample and do not cover it
for some days so that plenty of air is available; further, slightly under-saturate sample with
water. Heavily saline soil (> 20%o) should be "washed", if no ciliates develop. Saturate the
sample with water^ as described above. After two to three days, remove the percolate and
saturate again with water. Repeat two to four times, until ciliates begin to develop.
4. A distinct succession occurs in the rewetted samples. Thus, they must be inspected on
days 2, 6/7, 13/14, 21/22, and 30. Later inspections usually add only few species, likely
because microbiostasis (ciliatostasis; see FOISSNER 1987d) increases and metazoan (roti-
fers, nematods) and protozoan (mainly heliozoans!) predators often became abundant. For
inspection, the Petri dish is tilted some seconds and a rather large drop (~ 0.3 ml) of the
drained water ("soil percolate") taken with a Pasteur pipette and inspected for species;
several such drops must be investigated from different sites of the Petri dish, until the last
drop adds but few species.

2.2.2 Identification of Species, Collection of Material for Preparations, other Culture
Methods
Identification: Provided sufficient experience, many ciliate species can be identified from
life at low magnification (x 100-200). Of course, details must be checked at high magnifica-
tion (xlOOO, oil immersion), preferably with interference contrast optics. All "difficult", new,
or supposedly new, species must be treated with the silver impregnation techniques described
below. Accordingly, our species lists are a mixture of taxa identified in vivo and/or silver
preparations. However, we emphasize that all species were seen in silver slides, at least from
one site. Thus, seen on a whole, all species were observed in vivo and silver preparations.
Identification literature is highly scattered and cited in the reference section and FoiSSNER
(1998a). Still indispensable are KAHL'S monographs and, for colpodids and oxytrichid hypo-
trichs, the recent reviews by FoiSSNER (1993c) and BERGER (1999); for euplotids, peritrichs
and suctorians, the reviews by CURDS (1986) and WARREN (1986) are very useful. Keys for
limnetic or marine ciliates are almost useless because only about 25% of the species occur
both in terrestrial and limnetic habitats.
Collection of Material for Preparations: If a "difficult" species is noted, which happens in
more than 70% of the samples, material for preparations must be collected. To obtain many
specimens, the Petri dish is tilted (45°) several times for a minute or so and the percolating
soil water collected with a Pasteur pipette from several sites of the dish. If only little water (<
10 ml) drains from the sample and/or the species of interest is very rare, it should be sprinkled
with 10-15 ml distilled water. This will cause an osmotic shock, detaching or rinsing many
specimens from the soil particles and capillaries within about 10 min. Then, the procedure
described above is repeated, that is, the Petri dish is tilted several times and the percolating
soil water added to the first collection. Finally, the soil sample is again saturated with clean
table water (e.g. Eau de Volvic) and stored for the next investigation. Certainly, these proce-
dures strongly change the milieu, and thus a rather different ciliate community may develop,
possibly containing further "difficult" species. If so, the whole procedure is repeated, and so
on.
Much care must be taken to keep the percolate clean of large (> 2 urn) soil particles, which
would disturb the investigation of the preparation, while particles smaller than 2 \im hardly
disturb, if not too numerous. To achieve clean material, note the following advice:
1. Usually, the percolating soil water which contains the organisms will be clean because the
soil particles soon become stabilized by microbial activities, mainly by fungal hyphae and
bacterial mucilage. Thus, extreme care must be taken not to destroy the soil structure
developed in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Accordingly, the Petri dish must be
handled gently and, if necessary, distilled water sprinkled softly on the surface. To
increase percolation, mild finger pressure on the soil may be applied. Depending on the
material sampled, the percolate has a light brown to orange colour (from lignins, humus
colloids, etc.), which does not disturb the preparations (but see below).
2. The percolate is now gently shaken and large soil particles allowed to settle for about one
minute. Then, the supernatant, which is now ready for preparations, is collected with a
Pasteur pipette. Be careful not to lose bottom-dwellers. Occasionally, it may be helpful to
sieve the percolate through a plankton net with 50-100 urn mesh-size or to concentrate it
by mild centrifugation (max. 2000r/min for a few seconds), especially for preparations
32

with expensive chemicals (osmium tetroxide in CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate impregna-
tion).
Other culture methods: The non-flooded Petri dish cultures, as described above, provided
about 90% of the material contained in the monograph. The rest is from a variety of ordinary
"limnetic" cultures. First, clone cultures were made in the usual way by transferring individual
specimens into various media, preferably Eau de Volvic (French table water), either pure or
mixed with soil extract in a ratio of 10:1 and enriched with a crushed and two uncrushed
wheat grains to stimulate growth of indigenous food organisms, viz., bacteria and small
flagellates; occasionally, selected food items were added, for instance, filamentous cyano-
bacteria for several nassulids. Second, 2 ml of the percolate (together with all organisms)
were mixed with 8 ml Eau de Volvic and enriched with wheat grains, as described above. Of
course, such cultures contain a variety of ciliates, and sometimes interesting species develop
for a while. Third, a Petri dish was filled with 10-20 urn culture medium plus some wheat
grains. Then some grams of soil are added as an inoculate to a small site of the Petri dish,
taking care not to distribute it throughout the medium. Such cultures were sometimes helpful
for strongly saline material (> 20%o), which is set up with artificial sea-water.
Fourth, if the sample is very saline (> 20%o), it may occur that no ciliates develop. Such
samples can be "washed" every third day with fresh table water, which decreases the salt
concentration. Frequently, ciliates appear after the third or fourth wash!
2.2.3 Morphological Methods
The methods used for in vivo observation and preparations were the same as described in
FoiSSNER (1991). Thus, the reader is referred to this paper. Occasionally, other methods were
applied; these are mentioned in the respective species descriptions. As concerns protargol
impregnation, protocol A (PA) is "FoiSSNER's method", while protocol B (PB) is "WiLBERT's
method".
Scanning electron microscopy of ciliates contained in the percolate was difficult because the
fine soil particles adhering to the hairy specimens and /or soil colloids more or less
completely precipitated during fixation. Thus, good results were usually obtained only from
pure cultures as described above.
2.2.4 Description of Species, Morphometry, and Illustrations
Our study contains only species observed both in vivo and silver preparations, as minimal
requirements for a solid description, morphometry, and illustration; light and scanning
electron micrographs were prepared whenever possible.
Species descriptions were performed in telegramese style, as is good practice among experi-
enced taxonomists, a fact often overlooked by protozoologists, who prefer prose style, which
makes the description unnecessarily long and circumstantial. Furthermore, each of the new or
improved taxa is headed by a brief "diagnosis", containing only those features which, in our
opinion, separate the species from its nearest relatives, as already emphasized by LINNE. A
"diagnosis" is not an abbreviated description, as is often assumed, and is thus usually very
short.
33

Usually, our descriptions have a certain order, namely that used in identification: body size
and shape; nuclear apparatus; contractile vacuole; cortex and extrusomes; cytoplasm and
food; movement; somatic and oral ciliary pattern; occurrence and ecology; comparison with
related species. Within the individual items, location of the structure comes first, followed by
its shape and size.
Morphometry is indispensable for a good description of a ciliate and was performed on 10-20
randomly selected, well-impregnated specimens. The data is tabulated and thus repeated in
the descriptions only if needed for clarity. Most observations were from material as obtained
with the non-flooded Petri dish method, that is, not from clone cultures. Thus, we cannot
exclude that similar but different species were sometimes confused, although this is unlikely
because we excluded specimens which deviated in at least one prominent feature. Certainly,
this can generate some bias in the data if used too uncritically. However, we usually excluded
only such specimens which had, e.g., a different nuclear structure (likely often postconju-
gates), a distinctly deviating ciliary pattern (likely often injured, regenerating or malformed
specimens), an unusually small size (likely often degenerating, just excysted or divided
specimens), or a combination of deviating features. The inclusion of such individuals, which
might sometimes belong to another species, would have artificially increased variability.
In vivo measurements of body size were performed at a magnification of x 100-250, while
details such as extrusomes and food vacuoles were measured at xlOOO, where a measuring
unit of the ocular micrometer is 1 urn. Likewise, all measurements of prepared cells were at a
magnification of x 1000. Measuring body size in vivo provided only rough values because the
cells were moving. We used these data mainly as a kind of control for shrinkage due to the
preparation procedures. Thus, the in vivo body size given for a certain species is a composite
from a few representative live specimens and the data obtained from the silver slides, assum-
ing a shrinkage of 10-20% in protargol preparations and of 5-10% in silver nitrate slides
(DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986; own unpubl. observ.). Standard deviation and
coefficient of variation were calculated according to statistics textbooks.
Illustrations of live specimens were based on free-hand sketches and/or micrographs and
video prints. Generally, our main in vivo illustration of a certain species represents a summary
of the observations, that is, shows a "representative" specimen composed on observations of
live and prepared cells. Illustrations of prepared cells were made with a camera lucida and
show the specimens as they are, smoothed only by removing obvious artifacts. Great care was
taken to make these illustrations accurate and beautiful; usually, a "typical" specimen is
shown with values near the arithmetic means.
Micrographs are an important supplement to any description, but often difficult to obtain
because the cells are moving and/or out of the focal plane. Thus, much patience and skill is
needed to produce meaningful micrographs. Even more helpful is scanning electron micros-
copy because it provides a three-dimensional view of the organism. Unfortunately, good
scanning electron micrographs are difficult to obtain from soil ciliates for the reasons
explained above. All these problems made it impossible to provide micrographs of all species
described.
If not stated otherwise, all figures are orientated with the anterior end of the organism directed
to the top of the page. Scale bars are given only in the line drawings because cells shown in
the micrographs were often strongly flattened or shrunken (30-50% shrinkage are usual in
scanning electron microscope preparations!).
34

2.3 Species/Subspecies Concept
The species concept, of course, influences the number of species found and/or recognized as
undescribed (LUCKOW, 1995, MCDADE, 1995, TURNER, 1999). We usually apply the phylo-
genetic species concept as defined by NIXON and WHEELER (1990): "A species is the smallest
aggregation of populations (sexual) or lineages (asexual) diagnosable by a unique combina-
tion of character states in comparable individuals (semaphoronts)". Basically, this is a
morphospecies concept which is, according to EHRENDORFER (1984) and FiNLAY et al.
(1996), as valid as any, and probably more pragmatic than any other; see EHRENDORFER
(1984), LUCKOW (1995), MCDADE (1995), and TURNER (1999) for detailed discussion.
We do not consider ourselves as splitters, that is, we classify species as undescribed (new)
only if populations can be separated from their nearest relatives by at least one distinct (non-
morphometric) morphological feature, such as presence/absence of caudal cirri or rod-shaped
vs. fusiform extrusomes, or if quantitative differences, such as body size and/or number of
ciliary rows, are really conspicuous (> 100%). Furthermore, we must have seen at least 10
individuals and studied the species in vivo and silver preparations, to provide reliable
morphometrics, illustrations, and types. Certainly, the present monograph could contain many
more new species, if we had included all the taxa/specimens seen only in the silver slides.
However, it is our belief that careful live observations are indispensable for a good descrip-
tion. Thus, we rarely describe species seen only in silver slides.
MAYR (1963) defines a subspecies as "an aggregate of local populations of a species inhabit-
ing a geographic subdivision of the range of the species, and differing taxonomically from
other populations of the species". This concept, especially geographic isolation has been
widely adopted, although there is still a lot of discussion (BÖHME 1978, O'NEILL 1982,
ROLAN-ALVAREZ & ROLÄN 1995). Unfortunately, biogeography of protozoa is still in its
infancy, and thus MAYR'S concept hardly can be applied. Nonetheless, subspecies are useful
also in protists, when used restrictively and as a simple taxonomic tool.
In the present monograph, we distinguish subspecies according to distinct morphometrical
differences in important features (e.g., number of ciliary rows) and/or qualitative (morpho-
logical) characters whose taxonomic value is still doubtful or not known. It is the last
mentioned feature which makes the subspecies concept so useful: the name can be easily
withdrawn if later research proves the features used to be unreliable, and the discoverer does
not lose priority to "armchair" taxonomists if the subspecies later gets species rank
(INTERNATIONAL CODE OF ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE 1999). Furthermore, subspecies
"collect" the infraspecific variation, that is, data which tend to be lost (Zusi 1982), and
enhance identification of species because of the broader concept; thus subspecies are espe-
cially useful for people and disciplines not specifically trained in taxonomy. In spite of the
obvious advantages, protozoologists rarely used the subspecies/subgenus concept, although
KAHL (1932) established some subgenera and varieties in ciliates and one third of the testate
amoebae taxa are "variations" or "forms", most of which must be considered as subspecies
according to the ICZN (FoiSSNER & KORGANOVA 2000). Further, subspecies are common in
extant and fossil foraminifera (BOLTOVSKOY 1954) and fossil tintinnids (BELOKRYS 1997).
There is now a tendency to use them also in extant ciliates (SONG & WEI 1998).
A further main factor influencing the number of species recognized as undescribed is the
treatment of literature data. Many of the old protozoan species descriptions lack type material
and are poor compared with the present standard because the pioneers did not have the
35

advantages of modern methods. Clearly, there is a tendency to disrespect the efforts of our
predecessors and to establish new taxa with new methods. Our approach is to respect and re-
interpret previous work and to neotypify species, provided that at least one main feature
matches (see also chapter on neotypification). Representative examples for our way of making
honest alpha-taxonomy can be found in the section on nassulids in this monograph.
2.4 Type Material and Neotypification
2.4.1 Type Material (Table 1)
All descriptions in this monograph are based on live observations and silver impregnations,
which usually yield permanent slides. For the new and the neotypified species, at least 1
holotype and 1 paratype slide have been selected. One or more slides have been selected for
the species redescribed. All slides have been deposited in the Oberösterreichische Landes-
museum in Linz (LI), Austria. The slides usually contain several specimens, with about 10
relevant cells marked by a black ink circle on the cover glass (Table 1).
If appropriate, the type slides are accompanied by an equally - sized sheet of paper, which
states the species and the kind of types contained (H - holotype specimen, N - neo (holo) type
specimen, P - paratype specimen, V - voucher). The specimens which served as a basis for
the illustrations are marked by the letter "D", for instance, PD = paratype used for illustration.
The holotype specimen (H), of course, has been drawn. Note that some slides contain types of
several species, which are distinguished by different colours or letters. Furthermore, several
species occurring in Namibia and described in this paper have been found and studied previ-
ously in soil samples from other regions of the world. Thus, the type location of some of the
new taxa is not in Namibia, that is, not contained in the site descriptions given above. Brief
site descriptions for these species and populations are provided in the respective occurrence
and ecology sections. The samples were processed like those from Namibia.
2.4.2 Neotypification
We broadly apply neotypification in our monograph. As this poses a major problem (see
below), we shall discuss it in detail. Furthermore, we have submitted a manuscript to the
Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature discussing neotypification in protists.
Methods for preparing soft-bodied ciliates with a quality that provides meaningful types to be
deposited have only been available for the past three decades. At present, most "modern"
ciliate types are deposited in two centres: the Smithsonian Institution in the USA (CORLISS
1972, COLE 1994) and the Museum of Natural History of Upper Austria in Linz (AESCHT
1994). However, more than 90% of all described ciliates lack type material at all, or the
material hardly shows the species-specific features, or is difficult to obtain because deposited
in private or University collections (see FoiSSNER & PFISTER 1997 for an example).
Certainly, the lack of types is one of the most difficult problems in ciliate and protozoan
alpha-taxonomy in general. There are innumerable examples of poorly described species,
doubtful identifications, and problematic redescriptions. Although my group usually recog-
nizes a thorough redescription as "authoritative" (e.g. FoiSSNER 1993c), others do not.

BERGER (1999), for instance, assigned Onychodromopsis flexilis STOKES, 1887, carefully
redescribed and neotypified by PETZ & FoiSSNER (1996), to Allotricha, a genus and species
never illustrated or carefully described. Obviously, no consensus can be reached, and ciliate
identification and nomenclature remain a matter of choice.
Clearly, many of the existing problems could be solved by types. The present practice of
using illustrations as types cannot solve the problem because these cannot be reinvestigated.
Thus, neotypification is the only way to overcome these and related problems and to bring
stability in ciliate taxonomy and identification. This was emphasized already in 1972 by
CORLISS, who established some neotypes for "difficult" ciliates in the sixties. Likewise,
MEDIOLI & SCOTT (1985) established neotypes for some testate amoebae. Generally,
however, neotypification is very rare for protists. It was only recently that my group com-
menced using this valuable instrument on a large scale (FoiSSNER 1997d, 1999b, FoiSSNER &
BROZEK 1996, FOISSNER & DRAGESCO 1996, FOISSNER & KREUTZ 1996, PETZ & FOISSNER
1996); several specialists followed (AGATHA & RIEDEL-LORJE 1998, PETZ et al. 1995, SONG
et al. 2001).
Neotypification is strictly regulated by article 75 of the Code (ICZN 1999). Because our neo-
types deviate in an important aspect from the Code rulings, and protists have several peculi-
arities (CORLISS 1993), they need a detailed comment. We establish neotypes only if at least
one of the following items applies:
(1) No useable type material is available and the identification appears reasonable.
(2) The original description is so incomplete and/or based on so few specimens that any
identification becomes arbitrary. Alternatively, such descriptions could be
considered as species indeterminata. However, this would greatly increase the number
of scientific names because many original descriptions of ciliates are very incomplete,
at least from our present point of view. Thus, we prefer to identify our taxa with
previous ones, even if these are poorly described, and to redefine them by detailed
redescriptions; of course, identification requires matching of at least one main feature.
(3) The species has one or more proposed subjective synonyms, that is, a questionable
identity discussed in the literature. This is, in the absence of type material, a
"classic" case for neotypification.
(4) If there are several similar species whose identity is threatened by the species to be
neotypified.
(5) If there are competing redescriptions.
(6) If the new preparations ("neotype slides") are of a quality allowing the specific
features to be clearly recognizable.
Conditions as described above basically pose no problems for neotypification according to the
Code. However, our neotypes usually do not comply with article 75.3.6., that is, are not from
or near the type location. Thus, they might be considered as invalid. However, we defend our
approach for the following reasons:
(1) Most ciliates and protists are cosmopolitan, at least at morphospecies level (FiNLAY
et al. 1996, FoiSSNER 1999d).
44

(2) The existing chaos can be mastered only by types available to everyone. Certainly, the
chaos produced by a few probably misidentified neotypes is much smaller than the
existing one.
(3) Considering the situation in alpha-taxonomy of ciliates, where only a handful of
regularly publishing taxonomists are left worldwide, we cannot wait for neotype
material from or near the type location. If so, types will never be established!
Furthermore, the chances of rediscovering such minute organisms at a certain
location are minimal because they may be in a dormant (cystic) stage most of their
lives and cultivation is often not successful.
To sum up, we suggest that neotypes of protists, especially ciliates, should be freed from the
type location regulation of the INTERNATIONAL CODE OF ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE (1999;
article 75.3.6.), provided that neotypification is based on a thorough redescription of the
organism and useable neotype material has been deposited in an acknowledged repository.

3. RESULTS
3.1 Ecology and Community Analysis
3.1.1 Methodological Problems
Data of the kind we present are highly dependent on the (non-flooded Petri dish) method used
to reactivate ciliates from the air-dried samples, that is, to stimulate them to leave the resting
cysts and to reproduce to detectable numbers. We highlight this problem, although it was dis-
cussed in detail by FOISSNER (1987d, 1997c, 1999d), because it heavily influences data analy-
sis and interpretation. Specifically, it causes undersampling of species which are rare and/or
have special demands (FOISSNER 1997c), and explains the phenomenon that 30-40% undes-
cribed species are found in large sample collections, such as the Namibian material, while the
individual samples contain only one or two new species (FOISSNER 1999d).
Usually, soil ciliates are not active but encysted, producing a "hidden biodiversity". The rest-
ing cysts can survive for years (FOISSNER 1987d), provided they are from specimens living in
dry or temperate climates, where soils desiccate from time to time; in humid environments,
such as rain forests, the resting cysts are not adapted to survive longer dryness, and thus the
non-flooded Petri dish method does not work (FOISSNER 1997d). But even with "optimal"
samples, the non-flooded Petri dish method is selective, that is, cannot provide an environ-
ment suitable for all kind of ciliates. This becomes evident when the same site is investigated
several times over a year (FOISSNER 1999d), or a single sample is manipulated to encourage
encysted and more rare forms of ciliates to emerge (ESTEBAN et al. 2000). Figure 4 shows that
a single sample from a certain site collects only about one third of the species actually present,
that is, the number found in 17 replicates distributed over two years (further examples, see
FOISSNER 1987d). Very likely, this applies also to the Namibian samples.
Fig. 1. Cumulative number of
species obtained with the non-
flooded Petri dish method
(FOISSNER 1987d) in 17 monthly
and bimonthly samplings from
an 100 m2 area of beech forest
soil in Austria. The curve flattens
distinctly at sample number 13,
indicating that further effort
hardly will increase species
number significantly. However,
direct investigation of fresh
samples after rainfalls provided
30 further species. According-
ly, the total number approaches
160 species, which is far from
the total number (about 1000)
of soil ciliates known. Thus, we
do not agree with the hypothesis
Of FlNLAY & ESTEBAN (1998)
that "all species of freshwater 50
protozoa could eventually be S 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 IS 16 17
discovered in one small pond".
Monthly and bimonthly sampling over two yean
46

Fortunately, we have indications that the situation changes if many samples are analyzed from
a not too large area, that is, if the 73 Namibian samples are considered as some sort of repli-
cation. To test this, we investigated sites (37) and (56) twice, viz., in 1994 and 2001 (Table 2).
Although the species composition and the new species found vary greatly between years
(species overlap by only about 50%), almost all known and new species were found at other
sites of Namibia in 1994. However, many undescribed species occur at sites not investigated
in 1994 (chapter 3.1.7).
Even if a certain ciliate excysts, we can hardly recognize it among the mass of soil particles.
To be seen, it must reproduce to a detectable number. And even if this occurrs, there still
remains the problem of recognizing it as a distinct taxon among hundreds of individuals from
other species, many of which look alike. Only when experience, live observation, and silver
impregnation are combined, reliable species lists will emerge.
In sum, there is convincing evidence that the non-flooded Petri dish method is selective, that
is, reactivates only a rather small, undefined proportion of the resting cysts present in a
sample, and undescribed species or species with specialized demands are undersampled.
Thus, the real number of species, described and undescribed, is considerably higher in the
samples investigated. Unfortunately, a better method for broad analysis of soil ciliates is not
known. On the other hand, FOISSNER discovered about 700 new ciliate species with this
simple method, suggesting, inter alia, that a considerable amount of the hidden biodiversity
can be revealed by investigating large numbers of samples.

3.1.2 Species Lists and Similarity (Cluster) Analysis of Sites
Tables 3 and 4 provide an overview of the ciliate species contained in the present monograph
and show several community parameters (frequency, geographic distribution, etc.); see table
headings for more detailed information. Additionally, the species occurring in the Etosha
region and the dunes of the Namib Desert are separately listed in tables 5 and 6 to facilitate
comparisons and calculations. We emphasize that the lists have been prepared very carefully,
that is, contain only species identified both in vivo and silver preparations, as explained in
chapter 2.2.2.
Table 3. Taxonomical and ecological summary of the species (i) found in Namibian and other
soil samples and (ii) described or redescribed in this monograph. The list contains 388 taxa, of
which 69 are redescribed and 143 are new species. New taxa marked by an asterisk (*) were
not found in Namibia. See table 4 for the species found in the 73 Namibian samples, and
FOISSNER (1998a) for a world list of soil ciliates.

a Classification mainly after CORLISS (1979), that of colpodids after FOISSNER (1993). CO - colpodid, CY -
cyrtophorid, GY - gymnostomatid (haptorid), HE - heterotrich, HM - hymenostome, HY - hypotrich, ME -
metopid, NA - nassulid, OL - oligotrich, PE - peritrich, PR - prostomatid, SU - suctorian.

b Food items were determined mainly by examination of the food vacuoles. B - bacteria, C - ciliates, D -
diatoms, E - blue green algae (cyanobacteria), F - colourless flagellates, G - green algae, including autotrophic
flagellates, H - hyphae and/or spores of fungi and yeasts, N - naked amoebae, R - rotifers and/or nematodes, S -
inorganic and organic soil particles ("detritus"), T - testate amoebae.
c This compilation contains only reliable records from terrestrial habitats globally. Thus, unsubstantiated records
(for instance, Metopus palaeformis by ESTEBAN et al. 1995 from volcanic soil on the Canary Islands) and true lim-
netic or marine records are not included (for instance, Metopus contortus discovered in a marine habitat in
Sweden). Occasionally, this may be a little bit arbitrarily, for instance, with samples from river banks, dry road
puddles, or the Etosha Pan, which is sometimes flooded. See also next footnote. Classification of biogeographic
regions. H - Holarctis (North America, Greenland, Eurasia with Iceland, Canary Islands, Korea, Japan, and north
Africa), P - Palaeotropis (Africa south of Sahara desert, Madagascar, India, southwest Asia), A - Australis (mainly
Australia), N - Neotropis (Central and South America), Ar - Archinotis (Antarctica and Islands in the southern
oceans), SNN — reliable soil records not known.
d * low, reliably recorded also from freshwater habitats; ** probably strong; includes most of the new species and
many inhabitants found in mosses and in mud and soil samples from astatic (ephemeral) puddles; *** probably
found exclusively in true terrestrial habitats (litter, soil, humus under and in moss etc.). Only species with specific
food requirements or very characteristic morphological adaptations have been classified to this level; furthermore,
species belonging to genera known from soil only, were usually also classified to this level.
e Species described by A - Sabine AGATHA, B - Helmut BERGER, F - Wilhelm FOISSNER.

Similarity analysis was performed with the computer programs SPSS 10.0 for Windows,
Freetree (http://www.natur.cuni.cz/~flegr/freetree.htm), and Treeview (http://taxonomy.zoology.
gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html). Several similarity coefficients and cluster algorithms were tried,
as suggested by BIRKS (1987). The most meaningful results were obtained with JACCARD'S
and DICE'S similarity coefficients and the average-linkage and UPGMA cluster algorithms.
"Meaningful" was tested by a priori grouping of the 73 sites into the following habitat types:
Etosha Pan sensu stricto (Pan and Pan margin, usually highly saline; sites 53, 54, 56, 57, 59,
60, 61, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71); Etosha Pan sensu lato (Etosha Pan sensu stricto plus surroundings;

16, 17, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38); savannahs (sites 1, 2, 3, 5, 13, 15,
16, 17, 28, 33, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 62, 64, 72, 73); riverine and lacustrine
sites (4, 8, 18, 29, 30, 41, 42, 49, 66, 69, 73). Some special sites (6, 7, 10, 14, 19, 21, 22, 25,
58, 68) were excluded because they contained very few species (< 10), which would disturb
calculation of both similarity coefficients and cluster algorithms.
Both coefficients and algorithms produce similar clusters, indicating stability of the results
(Fig. 5, 6). However, habitat discrimination remains blurred, either due to poor habitat selec-
tivity of ciliates or methodological shortcomings. Likely, the latter are the main problem
because (i) the cultivation method used can stimulate only about one third of the ciliate
species to reproduce to detectable numbers (chapter 3.1.1) and (ii) all sites with a high number
of species (> 47; 4, 30, 33, 41, 49, 50, 54, 56, 60, 70) accumulate into a single sub-cluster
(marked by a thick dot in Fig. 5, 6), irrespective the habitat type (riverine, savannah, and Pan
sites). However, some patterns are recognizable and indicate habitat specificity of ciliates, as
do literature data reviewed by FoiSSNER (1987d).
(i) A fairly distinct separation of the Etosha and Namib sites is recognizable, the former are in
the lower half of the clusters, the latter in the upper half. Site (18) matches the Pan sites
because it is a highly saline habitat.
(ii) A large sub-cluster is formed by the sites from the Namib Desert and Namib Escarpment
(sites 2, 12, 15, 17, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38, 44, 45, 46, 47).
(iii) The savannah sites are nearer to the Namib Desert than to the Etosha sites.
(iv) Several micro-clusters contain, for instance, rock-pools (sites 29, 66, 73) riverine and
puddle sites (4, 30,41,49, 50), and highly saline coastal sites (11, 36, 37, 39).
3.1.3 Species Numbers and Local Centres of Ciliate Diversity
3.1.3.1 Large scale comparison
With 365 taxa identified, that is more than half the known global soil ciliate diversity
(FoiSSNER 1998a), our investigation is by far the most comprehensive available worldwide.
From Germany, for instance, only 270 soil ciliate species have been reported, in spite of the
fairly detailed investigations by KAHL (1930-35) and WENZEL (1953), who described many
new species from moss. Thus, one can speculate that Africa and/or Namibia is a soil ciliate
biodiversity centre. There are indeed indications for this (FoiSSNER 1997c), but under-
sampling is a more likely reason. As shown in chapter 3.1.7, further sampling would increase
Namibian soil ciliate diversity to about 1000 species!
Ironically, the high number of species makes comparison with literature data difficult. It is,
however, remarkable that similar species numbers have been reported from limnetic eco-
systems, suggesting that both carry a similar number of species and the 2000 global soil
ciliate diversity (FoiSSNER 1997c) is an underestimate, as indicated also by other evidence
(chapter 3.1.7). DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) report 267 species (30% undes-
cribed) from tropical Africa (including some marine and soil species). FoiSSNER (1980a) found
73

194 species (34% undescribed) in 77 small water bodies of the Austrian Central Alps.
SCHMITZ (1986) identified 212 ciliate species in the Rhine, and FoiSSNER (unpubl.) found
nearly 400 species in the eutrophic Amper River near Munich. The last two studies report
only few new species because the goal was water quality evaluation and little time remained
to identify rare, possibly new species.
3.1.2.2 Local centres of ciliate biodiversity
Using total species number and the proportion of new species, at least four local ciliate diver-
sity centres were discovered in the region investigated (Table 4). Generally, species number
varies highly in the individual samples, viz. from 1 to 126 (141 if the unidentified taxa are
added), which is not surprising considering the variety of biota, but the highest value (141) is
unsurpassed by any other sample we ever studied. It even surpasses the numbers found in the
"rich" floodplain soils of Austria, Costa Rica, Brazil, and Australia (Table 8), and it is also
distinctly higher than the values reported from manipulated limnetic samples (ESTEBAN et al.
1993, 85 species; FiNLAY et al. 1993, 65 species).
Fortunately, the most important local ciliate centres of diversity (Etosha region, Namib
Desert) have already been protected by the Namibian government due to their uniqueness and
richness of higher animals and plants (BARNARD 1998). Our data emphasize the need for
protection because these areas now contain the loci classici of many new species. Unfortu-
nately, the richest site (49) has been lost (see below).
• Etosha Pan region (general description, see chapter 2.1.1.2): 216 ciliate species, of which
61 were undescribed, occurred in the 19 samples from the Etosha Pan region (Table 5). This
number is considerably higher than the 158 species identified at 17 sites in Austria (FoiSSNER
1987d; Table 14, sites c-h) and the 139 taxa found in 21 Australian samples (BLATTERER &
FoiSSNER 1988). There is an obvious correlation between salinity and species number in the
Namibian samples, viz., the total number of species decreases with increasing salinity
(extremity), while the number of undescribed species increases with increasing salinity, likely
because such habitats are poorly explored (Table 7). In fact, the high number of species in the
Etosha Pan region is likely correlated with the steep vertical and horizontal salinity gradients,
producing a sharp zonation of the vegetation (Fig. 3) and a great number of soil microhabitats.
Table 7. Etosha Pan transect. Total species number increases with decreasing salinity, while
the number of undescribed species increases with increasing salinity.

When dry, the upper 10 to 20 cm soil layer is like stone, hardly showing a distinct zonation,
but in wet conditions it doubles the volume (Fig. 250, 251) and many, only partially decayed
plant residues become visible. This mixture of soil and plant debris produces a nutrient-rich,
spongious matrix containing countless microhabitats. Salinity within the microhabitats shows
more or less distinct seasonal (floods) and daily changes because the strong insolation pulls
up salt from the deeper to the upper zones (GANSSEN 1963, GANSSEN & MOLL 1961,
HERDTFELDER 1984). The richness in microhabitats explains why there are so many species in
the Pan region although most individual samples contain comparatively few species: each
sample contains many, often undescribed species not found in other samples (Tables 4, 5).
• Namib Desert (general description, see chapter 2.1.1.3): The Namib has been arid for at
least 55 million years and is fed with moisture by the coastal fogs and with nutrients by the
savannahs at the east margin. This fortunate combination of geological stability, moisture, and
nutrients produced a rich fauna and flora with many endemic species, now probably also some
protists (BARNARD 1998, GRIFFIN 1998, SEELY 1988).
Likely, it is this special combination of features that causes the high ciliate diversity. About
60 species, of which 12 were undescribed, occurred in the nine samples from the "dune sea"
of the Southern Namib Desert (mainly the Sossus Vlei, that is, the dead end of an ephemeral
river). If we add the six samples from the marginal dunes, which are even more diverse, we
arrive at 150 species, of which 32 were undescribed (Table 6). This is an impressive number
when considering the 50 mm annual rainfall and 59 Antarctic samples which contained only
64 species (FoiSSNER 1996a)! Indeed, ciliate diversity of the Namib approaches that of
temperate regions from Austria and semi-arid soils from Australia (see above). Another
impressive aspect is the high abundances that developed in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures
only two to three days after rewetting, that is, before logarithmic growth of the organisms
commenced. This shows that the dunes are full of resting cysts, and protists likely play an
important, yet unrecognized role in dune life.
Similar to the Etosha Pan region, the new ciliate species of the Namib Desert have a very
patchy distribution occurring in only one or two samples, even if sites are close together, for
instance, Erimophrya arenicola, E. glatzeli, Paragonostomum caudatum, Protospathidium
namibicola, and Diplites arenicola. Several of the 32 new species occur only in this area
(Table 4), and those with a slender and/or small body, indicating adaptation to sand life, might
even be endemic, for instance, Protospathidium namibicola, Afrothrix multinucleata, and
Hemisincirra namibiensis.
• Aloe dichotoma (Quiver tree) forest and Bukaos River floodplain on the outskirts of
Keetmanshoop: The two samples from these sites each contained 11 new species and several
unidentified, likely also new species, indicating a further local ciliate diversity centre. With 90
species the sample from the Bukaos River floodplain has the second highest diversity in the
whole collection (Table 4), showing that this habitat type is among the richest not only
worldwide but also in Namibia (Table 8). In spite of this, floodplain soils have never been
investigated systematically for ciliates. The data now available suggest that floodplain soils
contain thousands of undescribed ciliate species (Table 8).
• Site (49), the Bambatsi Guest Farm: At this site, which is in the Mopane {Colophospermum
mopane) savannah, we collected dark mud and surface soil from some road puddles on the
farm. The sample was not only the richest of the whole collection, but also the richest we have
ever investigated: 126 identified plus 15 unidentified species, of which at least 40 were
75

undescribed! In contrast, DINGFELDER (1962), who investigated nearly 800 samples from
similar habitats in Germany, found only 132 species! Again, this is an indication that Namibia
is a ciliate diversity centre. However, other samples from this region and similar habitats
(sites 48, 50, 51, 52, 63) were not exceedingly rich, suggesting the following explanations: (i)
road puddles belong to the mixed (limnetic/edaphic) biotope type which are often very rich;
(ii) many species might have been introduced over the years by soil adhering to the car wheels
of the guests.
Unfortunately, all puddles were filled with sand and gravel in year 2000 when the road was
upgraded. As it was not tarred, there is hope that puddles will form again over the years!

3.1.4 Functional Groups and C/P Quotient
Most main taxonomic formations of ciliates are functional groups in an ecological sense. In
soil, their general significance was discussed by FoiSSNER (1987d, 1998a). The Namibian soil
ciliate community shows some remarkable differences to the world community (Table 9).
Specifically, gymnostomatids and nassulids as well as the respective feeding groups are over-
represented, while hypotrichs and peritrichs are under-represented (Table 9).
The nassulids obviously profit from the filamentous cyanobacteria, their preferred food,
covering wide areas of the Etosha region and the crust soil in the more arid landscapes.
Likewise, several cyanobacteria-feeding colpodids are unusually frequent, such as
Kuklikophrya ougandae and Rostrophrya spp., and even a new genus, Etoschophrya, possibly
developed in the Pan scooping off the rich cyanobacterial growth. The over-representation of
the gymnostomes, most being rapacious carnivores, is difficult to understand, but shows that
Namibian soils can sustain a rich predatory protist community. Possibly, the over-
representation is partially related to the complex taxonomy of the group, that is, several of
these often small and inconspicuous ciliates might previously have been lumped or not
identified at all.
LÜFTENEGGER et al. (1985) and WODARZ et al. (1992) showed that the ratio of colpodean and
polyhymenophoran (hypotrichs, oligotrichs, heterotrichs) ciliates, the so-called C/P quotient,
is an excellent measure of habitat extremity: r-selected colpodids dominate (C/P quotient > 1)
76

in unpredictable "extreme" habitats, while k-selected polyhymenophorans dominate (C/P
quotient < 1) in predictable, temperate habitats. This relationship is perfectly recognizable
also in the arid and/or saline Namibian soils, where hypotrichs, oligotrichs, and heterotrichs
are distinctly under-represented, when compared to the world soil ciliate community (Table
9). However, the overall C/P quotient is 0.6, showing that Namibian soils are not an extreme
habitat for the ciliates living there, likely because they had sufficient time (at least 55 million
years!) to evolve adapted populations and species (Table 9). In contrast, the C/P quotient is
1.3 in the young, postglacial European coastal dunes (VERHOEVEN 1999), where ciliates "adapted"

by selecting for common, euryoecious species. Nonetheless, the Namibian soils are basically
extreme habitats, which becomes obvious when the C/P quotient is calculated not from the
whole community but from the most frequent species: then, it amounts to 8.0, showing that
most frequent species are r-selected colpodids, while the quotients are between 1.3 and 1.6 in
the temperate central European area (Table 10).
Most peritrichs are sessile, filter-feeding ciliates and thus generally rare in the soil environ-
ment, where filter space is restricted by the small soil pores. In Namibia, peritrichs are espe-
cially rare because most soils are very sandy and thus lack stable pores. Nonetheless, one
species, Vorticella astyliformis, is among the most frequent species in Namibia and world-
wide (Table 10). As the name says, this species easily leaves the stalk when the environment
becomes unfavourable and then behaves like a free-swimming filter feeder, that is, changes its
functional group.
3.1.5 Frequencies and Characteristic Species Communities
200 of the 365 ciliate species identified occur at only one or two sites, showing (i) a very
patchy distribution of most species and (ii) a high proportion of possibly rare species. No
species occurred in all samples, and the euryoecious Colpoda steinii was most frequent,
occurring in 77% of the samples (Table 4, Fig. 7). The contribution of methodological short

comings to these results is unknown, but probably significant (chapter 3.1.1). On the other
hand, this or similar patterns are common in all ordinary protist, plant and animal communi-
ties (FENCHEL 1987, SCHWERDTFEGER 1975).
Only 11 species have frequencies of > 40%, viz., Colpoda cucullus, C. inflata, C. maupasi, C.
steinii, Exocolpoda augustini, Gonostomum affine, Homalogastra setosa, Nivaliella plana,
Plesiocaryon elongatum, Pseudoplatyophrya nana, and Vorticella astyliformis (Fig. 8, Table
10). Most of these species are frequent in soils globally and feed on bacteria, except for the
obligate fungivorous N. plana and P. nana; further, most belong to the r-selected, fast-
growing colpodids adapted to utilize the usually very short, wet periods in Namibia (chapter
3.1.4). Pseudoplatyophrya nana, a minute (25 urn) fungi and yeast feeder, is common in soils
worldwide, while the high frequency of N. plana is unique to Namibia and indicates high
abundances and wide distribution of certain fungi. However, this very minute (15 urn) ciliate
is easily overlooked and thus likely more frequent than data indicate.

LÜFTENEGGER et al. (1985). The higher the value, the extremer the habitat. The high value from South America
is a methodological artifact (FOISSNER 1997d).
Thus, there remains a single, outstanding species, viz., Exocolpoda augustini, whose
morphology and life cycle are described in detail in the systematic section. Exocolpoda
augustini feeds on bacteria and looks like an ordinary Colpoda, but has two special features:
81

(i) it divides in freely motile condition, while all other colpodids s. str. generate a division
cyst; and (ii) the resting (dormant) cyst has an extraordinarily thick wall. Both specializations
enable this species to survive in adverse, very short-lived habitats, such as dune seas of the
Namib Desert and the gravel plains along the Atlantic sea coast and in the Central Namib
Desert. Indeed, E. augustini is much more common in arid than temperate environments, and
is thus very rare in central Europe (FoiSSNER 2000a). Interestingly, it is absent from the Ant-
arctic (FoiSSNER 1998a), emphasizing that it is a thermophilic species.
Division in cysts is considered as an r-selected life strategy because it usually generates four
offspring and can occur under already suboptimal conditions (FoiSSNER 1987d, 1993c). The
data from E. augustini cast doubts on this interpretation, although the advantage of the freely
motile division remains obscure; possibly it proceeds faster than cystic division, which would
be a great advantage in arid environments, where the wet periods are often very short-lived.
Interestingly, almost the same ciliate species are most frequent in soils globally, indicating
global distribution of many euryoecious species (Table 10). On the other hand, differences
exist, with Exocolpoda augustini being the most remarkable example, showing that even fre-
quent species are not globally ubiquitous, as suggested by FiNLAY and FENCHEL. Further,
only few of the most frequent soil ciliate species commonly occur in limnetic habitats, mainly
Cyclidium glaucoma, Sterkiella histriomuscorum, and Cyrtolophosis mucicola. Thus, both
biotopes have highly distinct ciliate communities, as already shown by FoiSSNER (1987d).
3.1.6 Not Everything is Everywhere - Evidences from Literature and Namibian Soil
Ciliates
3.1.6.1 Literature
There is no direct way to prove endemism in microscopic organisms. Only careful analysis of
a great number of habitats with a variety of methods will provide sufficient pros and cons
over time. However, the trachelophyllids with their specific cortical scales would be an ideal
group for a closer examination of free-living ciliate endemism, just as FINLAY & CLARKE
(1999) did with the scale-bearing chrysomonad genus Paraphysomonas. They found 78% of
the described species in Priest Pot, a small pond in England. This is an impressive result, and
thus it is difficult to understand why FINLAY & CLARKE (1998) provided scale micrographs
from only 5 out of the 32 species found. In contrast, 22 of the 59 northern temperate Mallo-
monas species, a genus closely related to Paraphysomonas, are endemic; and 18 taxa are
restricted to the tropics (KRJSTIANSEN 2001). As concerns the trachelophyllids mentioned
above, the main problem is that their rarity makes global studies difficult. The present mono-
graph is, indeed, the first in-deep investigation of trachelophyllid diversity, but data are still
too meagre for any firm conclusion, even if the four unpublished species found recently are
included.
Evidence is accumulating, mainly from refined molecular methods, that both, free-living
bacteria (CHO 2000) and protists (FoiSSNER 1999d, FoiSSNER et al. 2001, HOLZMANN et al.
2001, KRISTIANSEN 2001, LA TERZA et al. 2001, NANNEY et al. 1998) have more or less
distinct biogeographies, contradicting the views of FENCHEL (1993) and FINLAY et al. (1996)
that, in micro-organisms, "everything is everywhere". Indeed, FINLAY & ESTEBAN (1998)
state: "As protozoan species are probably globally ubiquitous, there is every reason to
believe that all species of freshwater protozoa could eventually be discovered in one
82

small pond". In our opinion and to our best literature knowledge, there is no pond in the
world with the capacity to carry all protozoan species, and only 256 ciliate taxa have been
reported from Priest Pot, FINLAY'S well-studied model pond (FINLAY & MABERLY 2000). The
limited carrying capacity of single biotopes is a well known ecological principle, and thus
FINLAY will never find all free-living ciliates in his pond, even not his 3000 species.
While FoiSSNER (1999d) provides convincing examples for a restricted geographic distribu-
tion of several protozoan species and suggests that many more can be discovered in more
detailed investigations, ESTEBAN et al. (2001) state: "We remain unconvinced that there
exists a single example of a ciliate species whose distribution is restricted by geographi-
cal barriers". We shall show in chapter 3.1.6.3 that this conclusion is based on very selective
literature citation and unusual taxonomic practices. The rather lengthy discussion of this issue
is necessary to save our former (FoiSSNER 1998a) and the present data from incomplete and/or
incorrect citation by FINLAY'S group.
3.1.6.2 Namibian evidence
As explained above, "evidence" in the strict sense of the word cannot be obtained from our
data, but some "indications" making endemism and/or restricted geographic distribution of at
least some species likely. To clarify our view once more: We believe that most, but not all,
protists are morphological cosmopolitans. This is substantiated by the most frequent
species, which are almost the same in a wide variety of habitats and geographic regions
(Table 10).
(a) Most of the 143 new taxa were found only in Namibia or tropical Africa, although we
analyzed about 1000 soil and moss samples from all main biogeographic regions (FoiSSNER
1998a). Certain genera or genus groups possibly occur only in Africa or Gondwanaland. The
most impressive example is a group of slender hypotrichs with a bipartited adoral zone of
membranelies: Erniella (saline coastal soil of the Cape Verde Islands), —> Etoschothrix
(highly saline soil from the Etosha Pan), and -> Afrothrix (sand dune in the Namib escarp-
ment and, another species, in an ordinary grassland soil of Kenya).
(b) Many of the new species were found only at type location, even if several samples were
taken from, admittedly different, habitats nearby. Thus, either the distribution is very patchy,
suggesting high habitat-specificity, or the investigation method very incomplete. Likely, the
latter is a main drawback, as explained in chapter 3.1.1, but habitat specificity is also involved
because similar sites group to more or less distinct clusters (Fig. 5, 6) and, for instance, many
species from saline soils do not occur in ordinary soils.
(c) Populations from different biogeographic regions tend to be more different from each
other than those from the same area, for instance, -> Maryna namibiensis namibiensis and -»
Maryna namibiensis costaricensis. Similar examples are —> Rostrophryides africana africana
and —> R. africana etoschensis, as well as Bryophyllum lingua lingua and —> B. lingua
multistriatum. Sequence data are still rare and conflicting, but if both sequences and morpho-
logical traits are combined some biogeographic pattern becomes recognizable (FoiSSNER et al.
2001).

(d) A different species each of —> Kuehneltiella occurs in Europe (moss), Australia (semi-
desert), and Namibia (bark). A similar kind of vicariance is shown by species of the genera ->
Bilamellophrya and —> Parakahliella.
(e) Several new species and new genera were discovered in the dunes of the Namib desert.
Most of them show a very patchy distribution in the Namib dunes (Fig. 9) and do not occur in
dunes of deserts of the USA and Australia, where many other new species were discovered
(Table 11). The same is true for most new species from the coastal Namib and the Etosha Pan.
There are, however, also contrasting examples, most notably —» Kuklikophrya ougandae and
—> Reticulowoodruffia terricola, two euryhaline, possibly rare species. The first occurs also in
saline soils of Austria, and the second was discovered in highly saline sand from the Death
Valley, USA. Further, Idiocolpoda pelobia, a minute and possibly rare species discovered by
FoiSSNER (1993b) in dry mud of a stream in Hawaii, was found in Namibia and, most
recently, also in leaf litter in the surroundings of Salzburg, Austria.
As concerns the trachelophyllids mentioned above, morphologically indistinguishable popu-
lations of the "Eurasian" —> Trachelophyllum apiculatum were found in Venezuela, and the
"South American" Trachelophyllum chilense (now —» Epitholiolus chilensis) occurred in the
Namib Desert. However, identity of the Chilean and Namibian T. chilense still has to be
proved by scanning electron microscopy of the epicortical scales.
3.1.6.3 Critique of a recent paper on ciliate endemism by ESTEBAN, FINLAY, CHARUBHUN &
CHARUBHUN(2001)
a) The paper mainly deals with Loxodes rex, an almost 1 mm long and thus very conspicuous
anaerobic ciliate recorded as yet only from tropical Africa. ESTEBAN et al. (2001) claim to
have found this ciliate in Thailand.
Loxodes species are distinguished by the following main features (DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-
KERNEIS 1986, FOISSNER 1996d, KAHL 1931): body size, body shape, number of macronuclei,
number of micronuclei, arrangement of macronuclei, macro-micronucleus pattern, arrange-
ment of Müller vesicles, number of Müller vesicles, arrangement of cortical granules, colour
of cortical granules, number of somatic ciliary rows, various morphometrics of the oral appa-
ratus, and details of the infraciliature (known of only few species, but likely important;
FOISSNER 1996d). Of these features, all necessary for a reliable identification and, especially,
biogeographic comparison of populations, ESTEBAN et al. (2001) investigated only body size,
body shape (without indication of variability), and the number of Müller vesicles. Accord-
ingly, this study is insufficient for any firm conclusion and simply shows that there is a
Loxodes in Thailand similar to the African L. rex in body size and shape, and the number of
Müller vesicles. However, such similarities are quite common in congeners and even among
different genera, and thus tell us nothing about the species' identity (FOISSNER 1993c). The
same applies to another Gondwanan species, Neobursaridium gigas, which ESTEBAN et al.
(2001) claim to have found in Thailand.
Further, ESTEBAN et al. (2001) found their Loxodes in an artificial, 20 years old pond at the
Burapa University Campus, about 80 km east of Bangkok. Thus, it seems possibly that, if it is
L. rex at all, it was introduced by guest students or scientists, just like some North American
rotifers (SEGERS 2001), having a similar size to L. rex. This possibility must be taken into
85

account in modern times and, especially, regarding anaerobic organisms needing no oxygen
during transport.
Whatever might be true, it remains a fact that records of L rex are lacking from the much
better investigated Central European waters, especially from Priest Pot, where, according to
FINLAY & ESTEBAN (1998), all species of freshwater protozoa can be found (full citation, see
chapter 3.1.6.1).
b) Part of the cosmopolitan distribution of FINLAY'S Protozoa is caused by superficially dis-
cussed and premature synonymies. Several examples will be shown in the following para-
graphs because this is an important issue influencing both distribution and number of species
recognized.
ESTEBAN & OLMO (1997) synonymize Paurotricha cyclidiformis DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-
KERNEIS (1991) from Lake Tanganyika with the holarctic Cristigera pleuronemoides.
However, the African species has two caudal cilia, while C. pleuronemoides has only one, a
significant difference not discussed by ESTEBAN & OLMO (1997), but widely used as a species
character by many ciliatologists. Further, Paurotricha lacks the two equatorial ciliary girdles
present in Cristigera, another significant difference also recognized by ESTEBAN & OLMO
(1997), but considered as unimportant. Certainly, one cannot exclude that DRAGESCO'S
description contains heavy mistakes, viz., his species is C. pleuronemoides. However, this is
unlikely because DRAGESCO discussed relationships with Cristigera and another similar
genus, Paracyclidium, also lacking equatorial cilia. Accordingly, there is no objective reason
to synonymize Paurotricha cyclidiformis with Cristigera pleuronemoides. Even if these
differences are considered as unimportant at species level, the fact remains that the popula-
tions differ in at least two conspicuous features and are thus not identical in a biogeographic
context.
Next, ESTEBAN et al. (2001) discuss two studies on Lake Baikal ciliates, used by FOISSNER
(1999d) as examples for endemic species. While it is true that several Lake Baikal ciliates
described by GAJEWSKAJA (1933) were later found in other lakes, there is still a considerable
number of species which were not (yet?) found elsewhere and thus might be endemics. A
representative example is Liliimorpha viridis, which ESTEBAN et al. (2001) synonymize with
Stockesia vernalis: "However, GAJEWSKAJA (1933) may have been unaware of some earlier
literature. Her drawing of a living Liliimorpha viridis closely resembles the Stockesia vernalis
WENRICH, 1929. More recently, OBOLKINA (1995a) described the infraciliature of L. viridis;
however, the infraciliature shown in OBOLKINA (1995a) actually correspond to the well-
known ciliate Askenasia". See FOISSNER et al. (1999) for a detailed review of all species
mentioned.
Obviously, ESTEBAN et al. (2001) found only one reason for the synonymy suggested, viz.,
the overall shape similarity; meagre indeed! They do not, for instance, discuss the conspicu-
ous, membranellar structures surrounding the distal margin of Liliimorpha, possibly because
they are absent in Stockesia. It is true that Liliimorpha resembles an Askenasia, but not any
described species, and there is no reason why Liliimorpha should not be related to this genus.
Regardless of the taxonomic classification, the species shown by OBOLKINA (1995a) is either
L. viridis or another, as yet undescribed, probably endemic ciliate of Lake Baikal.
ESTEBAN et al. (2001) also suggest synonymy of Coleps grandis VACELET, 1961 and Baikalo-
coleps quadratus OBOLKINA, 1995b, another supposed endemic of Lake Baikal. This
86

synonymy is also highly questionable because C. grandis is a marine species, is twice the size
of B. quadratus (180 x 80 urn vs. 86 x 55 jam), and has more ciliary rows (about 28 vs. 21).
However, the main issue is that ESTEBAN et al. (2001) make no mention of six other endemic
Colepidae described by OBOLKINA (1995b) in the same paper; obviously, they did not find
related species in the literature, suggesting that these species might indeed be endemic to Lake
Baikal.
In other cases, the synonymies suggested by FINLAY'S group are even more worse, for
instance, they declare Holophrya seyrli FoiSSNER, 1997b as a junior synonym of Holophrya
discolor without providing any reason (ESTEBAN et al. 2000). Both differ in a prominent
feature, viz., the presence vs. absence of 10 urn long toxicysts documented by micrographs.
Such taxonomy not only unduely discredits other, more careful observers but also disrespects
basic taxonomic practices. Likewise, ESTEBAN et al. (2000) disrespect nomenclature, that is,
do not recognize fixed type species (of a genus), as is obvious from their use of the wrong
genus name (Prorodon) for their Holophrya (for details, see FoiSSNER et al. 1994).
c) ESTEBAN et al. (2000, 2001) state that they "found no endemic free-living ciliate species in
the sediment of a volcanic crater-lake with brackish water in Australia. All 85 species
recorded had previously been found in Northern Europe". However, four taxa were not identi-
fied to species level and several others are so poorly known and/or difficult to identify that we
took an interest in the voucher preparations, especially Perisincirra kahli, —» Protospathidium
bonneti, Holosticha grisea, Microdiaphanosoma terricola, Rhagadostoma completum,
Trachelocerca fusca, and Tracheloraphis caudata. On request, we obtained the following
information: "Our policy here is that we do not keep either permanent preparations or
samples". This is indeed a strange policy, far removed from good taxonomic practice, espe-
cially when just these species are used to disprove the existence of autochthonous soil ciliates
(p. 186)! Thus, the identifications of ESTEBAN et al. (2000) cannot be falsified and the study
cannot support the statement cited above. Further, in the same paper the authors describe a
new species, Lembadion curvatum, which is very conspicuous and thus a good candidate for
an Australian endemic.
d) In their passion to disprove a restricted geographic distribution and/or endemism of free-
living ciliates, ESTEBAN et al. (2001) fail to mention that hundreds of well-defined soil ciliate
species have been recorded from only one or two biogeographical regions (for a review, see
FoiSSNER 1998a). Certainly, we cannot exclude that some, or even many, will be found at
other sites in more detailed investigations. For the present, however, it is a fact that they were
absent in nearly 1000 samples from all main biogeographic regions.
e) FOISSNER (1999d) showed, and the above examples emphasize, that FINLAY'S group often
refers to literature data in an incomplete and/or inaccurate way. This is also the case in
ESTEBAN et al. (2001), where they state: "Bryometopus hawaiiensis FoiSSNER, 1994,
described as "endemic" to Hawaii (FOISSNER, 1994C), then was found in a freshwater
stream in Spain (OLMO & TELLEZ, 1996)". We agree that the Hawaiian and Spanish popula-
tions belong to the same morphospecies, but emphasize that FOISSNER (1994C) did not
"describe" it as an endemic but supposed that it could be endemic: "Bryometopus hawaiiensis
must be a rare species since I have not found it in about 1000 other soil and moss samples
collected worldwide; it is probably endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago". FoiSSNER's paper
is written in English, and thus there is no excuse for changing "probably" to "described". The
87

same kind of misquotation applies in the case of Holostichides terricola FoiSSNER, 1988a,
which has been recorded from all main biogeographic regions (FoiSSNER 1998a).
3.1.7 How Many Soil Ciliate Species in Namibia and Globally?
We identified 365 species and subspecies, of which 128 (34%) were undescribed, in the 73
samples from Namibia. Thus, each sample contained an average of 26.5 species, of which
1.75 were undescribed. About 100 rare species, half likely undescribed, were not identified
(Table 4). Adding these numbers to the identified species, we arrive at 465, respectively, 178
(40%) taxa. Considering the methodological problems discussed in chapter 3.1.1, we must at
least double these figures, that is, can expect about 650 described and 350 undescribed soil
ciliate species in Namibia. Thus, our monograph contains only one third of the species actu-
ally living in terrestrial habitats of Namibia. This is substantiated by the following observa-
tion: We investigated five samples from the year 2001 collection, all from habitats and/or
regions not sampled in 1994 (eutrophic soil from margin of water-holes in the Etosha
National Park, soils from coastal floodplain of the Uniab River). They contained 10 new
species, that is, an average of 2 new species per sample, which is even more than the 1.75
species calculated from the 1994 collection. Further, few of the diverse riverine, lacustrine,
palustrine, and estuarine wetland soils were collected in year 1994. Certainly, they contain a
significant number of undescribed species.
The total number of ciliates reliably reported from terrestrial habitats globally presently stands
at 643 species (FoiSSNER 1998a). With the new and several redescribed species contained in
the present monograph, we arrive at 800 species, that is, half the number (1330-2000 species)
suggested by probability statistics (FoiSSNER 1997c). Further, FoiSSNER still has 400 unde-
scribed species in his notes from soil ciliates globally. Accordingly, 2000 global soil ciliate
species can be reached, provided sufficient man-power. Considering the 143 new taxa
described in the present monograph, it is even likely that there are many more than 2000
species.
As concerns global diversity of free-living ciliates, the reader is referred to FoiSSNER (1999d)
and the "Introduction" to the present monograph, which summarize the present state of
knowledge. However, we would like to reinforce that global diversity of free-living ciliates
must be much higher than the 3060 species proposed by FINLAY (2001). This is not only indi-
cated by the many new taxa found in Namibian and floodplain soils (Table 8), but also by
some other observations:
a) FoiSSNER (in preparation) discovered three new ciliate genera and species in the tanks of
three Brazilian Bromelia species. Considering that the group contains about 3000 species, we
can expect that their detailed investigation will considerably increase free-living ciliate
diversity.
b) Habitat specificity of free-living ciliates has probably been greatly underestimated due to
superficial sampling and, especially, misidentification of species (FoiSSNER 1987d). We shall
demonstrate this with a few examples, suggesting a further significant increase in species
number when well-trained specialists investigate properly defined habitats: (i) A different
species each of Diplites lives in the Namib Desert (-» D. namibicola) and Namibian riverine
habitats (-> D. telmatobius); (ii) Parakahliella species not only show habitat but likely also
some biogeographic specificity: —> P. binucleata occurs in alluvial Namibian soils; —> P.

halophila occurs in aperiodically flooded, highly saline soils (sites 18, 54, 59, 61) and shows
some geographic specializations; -» P. namibicola has been found only in the Namib Desert
and Namib Escarpment; P. macrostoma occurs in alluvial, agricultural soil and alpine grass-
land in Austria; and P. haideri was discovered in Austria in a bundle of straw used for mush-
room cultivation; (iv) Habitat specificity occurs also in larger systematic groups, for instance
the Colpodea (FoiSSNER 1993c): The mycophagous grossglockneriids (Pseudoplatyophrya,
Grossglockneria, Mykophagophrys, etc.) are strictly terricolous; most Colpoda species prefer
terrestrial habitats; most Maryna species live in semiterrestrial habitats, such as road puddles
and bark; and Bursaridium is euplanktonic; (v) Frequently, the "extreme" members of a group
have specific life strategies and/or food requirements: —> Exocolpoda augustini, which prefers
hot and dry habitats, lacks division cysts and is strictly bacteriophagous; Sorogena stoiano-
vitchae, a phyllocolous colpodid, produces aerial sorocarps and feeds on small Colpoda
species (for a review, see FoiSSNER 1993c); and a still unnamed, bacteriophagous Colpoda
from Australian and Brazilian floodplains has a cover of fine clay particles, probably protect-
ing it from predation.

3.2.2 Descriptions
GYMNOSTOMATEA
The Gymnostomatea were founded by BÜTSCHLI (1889) for a group of ciliates with simple
(gymnostomous) oral ciliature. Later, many other names were suggested, such as
Litostomatea, Haptorida, Filicorticata, and Homotricha, for basically the same ciliates. Thus,
. and for reasons of stability (INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE
1999), we prefer BÜTSCHLi's time-honoured name Gymnostomata.
Gymnostome ciliates are very frequent in soils globally and, for obscure reasons, especially in
Namibia (chapter 3.1.4). Many are inconspicuous and look alike at first glance. More detailed
analysis, however, reveals quite a lot of organization types, especially of the circumoral
ciliature and extrusomes, which are highly evolved in this basically rapacious group of
ciliates. This is emphasized by the present study, which discovered 10 new gymnostomatous
genera and 57 new species.
Workers not familiar with the group tend to underrate the differences. ESTEBAN et al. (2000),
for instance, state: "Living cells of Pleuroplites australis are indistinguishable from ciliates of
the following genera: Coriplites, Enchelys, Enchelyodon, Foissnerides, Fuscheria, Pleuro-
plitoides, from some of KAHL's Spathidium species, and from Placus ovum (KAHL, 1926)".
This is nonsense; just the reverse is the case, especially with Placus ovum, which has a
unique, spiral kinety course and cortex structure (for a review, see FoiSSNER et al. 1994). But
also the other genera and species are easily distinguished by quite a lot of features, such as the
location (uniquely postcytostomal in Pleuroplites and Pleuroplitoides) and shape (uniquely
nail-like in Fuscheria) of the extrusomes, the presence/absence (uniquely lacking in
Enchelys) of a circumoral kinety and extrusomes (uniquely lacking in Coriplites), and the fine
structure of the dorsal brush (uniquely multi-rowed and with ordinary cilia interspersed in
Pleuroplites and Foissnerides). All these and other features can be recognized in vivo and/or
good protargol preparations. It is only the selective use of a single silver stain and insufficient
live observation which make these well-defined genera so similar to ESTEBAN et al. (2000).
Clearly, they have to improve their methodological diversity, otherwise they will be also
unhappy with most of the new genera described in this book.
Family Pseudoholophryidae BERGER, FOISSNER & ADAM, 1984
Improved diagnosis: Haptorid gymnostomes with spiral ciliary rows. Dorsal brush in
anterior half of few to many kineties, composed of numerous minute kinetofragments with
shortened bristles interspersed between ordinary cilia. Silverline system narrowly meshed.
Type genus (by original designation): Pseudoholophrya BERGER, FOISSNER & ADAM,
1984.
93

Remarks: The original diagnosis of the family ("dorsal brush lacking") has to be improved
because the reinvestigation of many Pseudoholophrya terricola populations showed that
Pseudoholophrya has a similar brush as —> Paraenchelys. The diagnosis of the genus
Pseudoholophrya is still valid as given by BERGER, FoiSSNER & ADAM (1984):
"Pseudoholophryidae with rod-shaped extrusomes occupying the minute oral opening".
Possibly, it should be supplemented by "rod-shaped to indistinctly acicular extrusomes" or,
more simply, "basically rod-shaped extrusomes".
The brush pattern of Pseudoholophrya is very constant and more or less distinctly different
from that of other gymnostomes. It resembles those of -> Paraenchelys (FOISSNER 1984),
Ovalorhabdos (FoiSSNER 1984, FOISSNER & GSCHWIND 1998), as well as Prorodon
armatides, as described by FoiSSNER (1997b), and Prorodon emmae, as redescribed by SONG
& WILBERT (1989). In P. armatides, which has, like Ovalorhabdos sapropelicus, an oblong
oral opening, the brush consists of two ordinary dikinetidal kineties plus several rows in
which dikinetids and monokinetids irregularly alternate. This pattern is distinctly different
from those of Ovalorhabdos, -> Paraenchelys, —» Pseudoholophrya, and Prorodon emmae,
which lack conventional brush dikinetids. These genera (and Prorodon emmae, which is
likely distinct at genus level) form a natural assemblage, which can be united in the family
Pseudoholophryidae BERGER, FOISSNER & ADAM, 1984. They differ from each other mainly
by the shape of the oral opening (circular and minute, except for Ovalorhabdos, in which it is
oblong and large) and the arrangement (in oral bulge, except for P. emmae which also has
distinct lateral bundles) and shape of the extrusomes (rod-shaped to acicular in
Pseudoholophrya, Ovalorhabdos and P. emmae vs. drumstick-shaped in Paraenchelys).
Pseudoholophrya terricola BERGER, FOISSNER & ADAM, 1984 (Fig. 10a-l, lla—
z;301a-v; Table 12)
Description of a Maldivean population: Because the original description of P.
terricola is in German and Maldivean-like populations occur in Namibia, we redescribe this
"difficult" species in detail. The sample was collected by Dr. Wolfgang PETZ at the North-
Male Atoll near the village of Himmafuchi. The highly saline and alkaline (pH 8.6) material
was taken about 2 m inshore and consisted mainly of shrub litter mixed with some sand.
Size 50-80 x 20-40 urn in vivo, distinctly shrunken in protargol preparations (50 x 20 urn;
Table 12). Slightly asymmetrical and flattened up to 2:1, broad-side view ellipsoidal to
somewhat dumb-bell-shaped, narrow-side view ovate and often slightly curved (Fig. 10a, e, h,
i; 30lg, m); very flexible but acontractile. Nuclear apparatus usually in middle body third.
Macronucleus mostly reniform, rarely ellipsoidal or semicircular, or in two nodules connected
by a broad bridge; nucleoli globular, small, numerous. Usually two micronuclei attached to
macronucleus at various positions; individual micronuclei discoidal and surrounded by a
distinct membrane (Fig. 10a, e, h, i; 301a, f). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end,
several excretory pores in pole area. Oral bulge extrusomes form conspicuous bundle in
anterior pole centre, slightly acicular and about 5 urn long; cytoplasmic extrusomes scattered
and shaped like oral ones or, occasionally, fusiform; exploded toxicysts drumstick-shaped,
hyaline, about 13 urn long (Fig. lOa-d). Cortex very flexible, contains innumerable granules,

Fig. lla-v. Pseudoholophrya terricola from life. All extrusomes (a-s) drawn to scale (5 |im) to show variability in length
and width. The extrusomes of P. terricola are toxicysts and rather small (about 6 x 0.6 (im); thus, they are difficult to
observe and measure. Accordingly, some subjectivity is unavoidable. Basically, the extrusomes of P. terricola are rod-
shaped, the variability becomes recognizable only on careful observation. Part of the variability is possibly caused by a slight
asymmetry of the toxicysts and by some differences between oral and (developing?) cytoplasmic organelles; furthermore,
they become more distinctly acicular shortly before exploding. Thus, the variability shown is likely an over-estimation.
However, all these details are difficult to recognize and quantify. The figures are free-hand sketches "polished" by the

likely mucocysts, forming a conspicuous sheet; individual granules rather compact and about
0.3 jam across, conspicuous under interference contrast illumination and in the scanning
electron microscope (Fig. 10k, 1; 301e, h, 1, u, v). Cytoplasm colourless, contains many fat
globules 1-5 jam across. Likely feeds on ciliates. Swims rapidly by rotation about main body
axis, showing conspicuous metachronal ciliary waves (Fig. 10a; 30 lg). Divides in freely-
motile (non-encysted) condition.
Cilia about 11 urn long in vivo and rather closely spaced, form spiral rows; frequently, some
rows shortened anteriorly and/or posteriorly, especially in brush area. Dorsal brush
inconspicuous, although extending across anterior third of five to eight kineties, because
composed of single and paired, only 2—4 urn long bristles interspersed among ordinary cilia
(Fig. 10a,e,fJ301h,l-p,r-u).
;
Oral apparatus in anterior pole area, conspicuous due to the pharyngeal extrusome bundle
contained; oral bulge, however, only 1-2 urn high and thus hardly recognizable in vivo and
protargol preparations. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, likely composed of dikinetids
that are difficult to recognize. Oral basket hardly recognizable in vivo unless extrusomes have
been released (Fig. 10a, e-i, 1 lu, v; 301a, e, r).
Observations on other populations: Pseudoholophrya terricola has few distinct
features and is thus a "difficult" species. The supposed lack of a dorsal brush (BERGER et al.
1984) and the variability of the extrusomes motivated us to study many populations from soils
world-wide. This showed: (i) Body shape and size are rather variable and indistinguishable
from those of Paraenchelys spp., emphasizing the importance of extrusome shape (Fig. 1 la-
n, w-z); (ii) Although basically rod-shaped, the extrusomes show a variety of shapes (rod-
shaped to acicular) and sizes (4-9 x 0.3-0.8 urn) on detailed investigation (Fig. lla-s; 301a-
e, i-k, q, t), but are never drumstick-shaped as in Paraenchelys (Fig. 1 lw-z); (iii) Invariably,
the extrusomes form a conspicuous bundle attached to the inconspicuous oral bulge,
occupying either the centre or the periphery (Fig. 10a, g, llu; 301a, d-f, n, t); (iv) The
composition and thus distinctiveness of the dorsal brush are highly variable because the
number of brush rows varies from about three to eight, and few to many bristles are
recognizable under interference contrast illumination in vivo, in good silver preparations, and
the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 10a, e, j; 30 lh, 1, n, r, s-u); (v) The nuclear pattern and
the dense cortical granulation are very stable (Fig. 10a, e, k, 1; 301a, f, u, v).
Occurrence and ecology: Pseudoholophrya terricola is a common ciliate in ordinary
and saline soils globally (FOISSNER 1998a). However, we cannot exclude that it is a complex
of morphospecies/subspecies, as discussed in the following section. Usually, P. terricola
appears one to two weeks after rewetting a sample, indicating that it is more k- than r-
selected.
Comparison with original description and of populations: The
identification is very likely correct because all main features match, except for the dorsal
brush which is lacking, according to BERGER et al. (1984). However, the brush is extremely
difficult to recognize without interference contrast optics and silver carbonate impregnation,
two methods not used by BERGER et al. (1984). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that they
simply overlooked the dorsal brush. This is substantiated by a reinvestigation of specimens
from near the type location. They have the same dorsal brush as the Maldivean specimens.

c Values too high, as indicated by the figures. More likely numbers are between 25 and 30. Kinety number is
difficult to count due to their spiral course and because they often impregnate poorly, that is, are partially hidden
by the cortical granules.

It is much more difficult to answer the question as to whether all populations studied belong
to the same species. The differences in the number of ciliary rows (on average 32 and 38 in
two populations studied by BERGER et al., only 21 in the Maldivean specimens; likely,
BERGER et al. overestimated the number, as indicated by the figures) and brush kineties (2-3
to about 8), as well as in extrusome length (4-9 urn) and shape (rod-shaped to rather
distinctly acicular) indicate at least several distinct races. However, all these features are
difficult to recognize and quantify, and thus we prefer to put all populations into a single
morphotype: Pseudoholophrya terricola.
Pseudoholophrya minuta nov. spec. (Fig. 12a-f; Table 12)
Diagnosis: Size about 35 x 18 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. Macronucleus ellipsoidal. Oral
extrusomes rod-shaped, fine, about 7 urn long. On average 15 ciliary rows, about half of them
differentiated to dorsal brush in anterior two thirds, that is, contain scattered dikinetids with
minute bristles.
Type location: Mud from granitic rock-pools in a stream of the Daan Viljoen Game
Park near Windhoek, Namibia, 22°35'S 17°05'E (site 73 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective minuta (small) refers to the minuteness of the organism.
Description: Size 30—40 x 15-20 urn in vivo, usually near 35 x 18 urn; length:width
ratio 1.3-2.1:1, on average 1.7:1 in protargol preparations. Shape simple, that is, broadly to
ordinarily ellipsoidal; unflattened, flexible but acontractile (Fig. 12a, e; Table 12).
Macronucleus in or near mid-body, broadly ellipsoidal, dissociated into two to four globules
in about half of 30 specimens observed. Micronuclei broadly ellipsoidal, usually near or
attached to macronucleus at variable positions. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, at
least one excretory pore in pole centre. Oral bulge extrusomes form conspicuous bundle in
anterior pole centre, rod-shaped and very fine, that is, 7-8 x < 0.5 urn. Cortex flexible, hardly
furrowed by ciliary rows, contains innumerable granules in indistinct rows, likely mucocysts,
forming a conspicuous sheet; individual granules rather refractive and thus distinct (Fig. 12b).
Cytoplasm colourless, contains many fat globules up to 5 um across, indicating a predatory
mode of life. Swims rapidly in wide spirals.
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo and rather closely spaced in anterior body half, arranged in
distinctly spiral rows; some rows shortened anteriorly and/or posteriorly. Dorsal brush
inconspicuous, although occupying almost half of the body surface, because composed of few
dikinetids with about 1 urn long bristles interspersed among ordinary cilia in anterior two
thirds of six to eight kineties (Fig. 12a, c, e, f; Table 12).
Oral apparatus in anterior pole area, conspicuous due to the pharyngeal extrusome bundle
contained, oral bulge, however, only 1 urn high and thus hardly recognizable in vivo or
protargol preparations, like the circumoral kinety and the oral basket (Fig. 12a, e).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rare but
present for three weeks in the non-flooded Petri dish culture.

Fig. 12a-f. Pseudoholophrya minuta from life (a-d) and after protargol
impregnation (e, f). This new species is characterized by its small size
(about 35 x 18 \im) and long dorsal brush rows, a: Left side view of a
representative specimen. Note the long cilia, b: Surface view showing the
dense cortical granulation, c: Part of a dorsal brush row. Dikinetids with

showing eight dorsal brush rows, most extending beyond mid-body. BA -
oral basket, CV - contractile vacuole, DB - dorsal brush. Scale bars 15
urn.
Comparison with related species: We do not include this population in -»
Pseudoholophrya terricola, although we attribute to this species a profuse variability, because
it is distinctly smaller (Table 12) and the dorsal brush rows extend almost to rear body end
(Fig. 12f), while they terminate above mid-body in P. terricola (Fig. lOe). The cilia, the brush
rows, and the extrusomes of P. minuta are disproportionally long, that is, about as long as in
the larger —> P. terricola, indicating that all differences are caused by body diminution.
Likely, the small size is stable because we observed such specimens for three weeks in the
culture and could not find a single large (P. terricola-like) individual in vivo or the protargol
slides.
Pseudoholophrya spp. are easily confused with Paraenchelys spp. (extrusomes drumstick-
shaped), Enchelys spp. (dorsal brush three-rowed and of ordinary fine structure), Enchelyodon
spp. (dorsal brush three-rowed and of ordinary fine structure, oral bulge usually distinct), and
several other small gymnostomatids. Thus, identification must be based on the unique
structure of the dorsal brush.

Enchelys longitricha nov. spec. (Fig. 13a—i; 302a-g; Table 13)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 x 30 urn in vivo; cylindroidal. Macronucleus a long, tortuous
strand; on average 9 micronuclei. Extrusomes in a row each between somatic kineties, rod-
shaped with narrowed ends, about 6 urn long. On average 18 ciliary rows, 3 differentiated
anteriorly to dorsal brush having conspicuous, up to 15 urn long bristles.
Type location: Moderately saline and alkaline (pH 8.1), dark-red sand mixed with some
halophyte litter from the surroundings of the village of El Haouaria, about 100 m inshore of
Cape Bon, Tunisia, 37°N 13°E.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective longus (long) and the Greek adjective tricho
(hairy), referring to the extraordinarily long brush bristles.
Description: This species is difficult to impregnate, that is, the cortical granules
impregnate so intensely that the ciliary pattern is hidden. Thus, we cannot provide full
morphometrics and description of the infraciliature. Anyway, the main feature of the species,
the long dorsal bristles, must be determined from life.
Size 100-200 x 20-35 urn in vivo, usually near 150 x 30 urn, length:width ratio highly
variable, viz., 3.2-9.6:1, on average 5.1:1 in protargol preparations (Table 13). Basically
cylindroidal, respectively, very elongate ovoidal with anterior region distinctly narrowed and
slightly convex in dorsal brush area (Fig. 13a, b); sometimes slightly curved and/or flattened,
acontractile; prepared specimens usually rather distinctly shrunken in anterior and posterior
third making cells more or less distinctly fusiform (Fig. 13i). Macronucleus usually in
posterior two thirds of cell, highly tortuous and frequently rather distinctly nodular; contains
many small, globular nucleoli. Micronuclei globular to ellipsoidal, most rather distant from
macronucleus (Fig. 13a, i). Contractile vacuole in posterior end, on average four excretory
pores in pole area. Extrusomes in oral bulge and perpendicularly attached to pellicle, forming
a meridional row each between two somatic kineties; extrusome rows difficult to recognize in
vivo and protargol preparations, but intensely impregnated by silver carbonate (Fig. 13a, d, g;
302a-c). Individual extrusomes 5-7 urn long, rod-shaped with more or less distinctly
narrowed ends, stronger curved in population II than I, do not or only faintly impregnate with
protargol, except for certain rather intensely impregnated developmental stages in the
cytoplasm; released extrusomes acicular and up to 20 urn long (Fig. 13e, f; 302c, g). Cortex
very flexible, about 0.8 urn thick, bright, indistinctly furrowed by ciliary rows, contains
countless minute (0.2-0.4 urn) granules in closely spaced rows and extrusomes as described
above; granules impregnate heavily with protargol, hiding the ciliary pattern (Fig. 13g; 302e-
g). Cytoplasm colourless and usually rather opaque due to many fat globules up to 3 urn
across. Food not observed and not recognizable in protargol-impregnated specimens,
indicating that prey dissolves rapidly. Movement without peculiarities.
Ciliary pattern hidden by the strongly impregnated cortical granules, data thus incomplete
(Fig. 13h, i; Table 13). Cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, closely spaced, especially in oral
region, arranged in equidistant, longitudinal to slightly spiral rows, three of which anteriorly
differentiated to dorsal brush composed of closely spaced, up to 15 urn long bristles forming
conspicuous tuft in mid-brush area. Individual brush rows separated by two distinct ridges
appearing like an oral slit at a magnification of x 100 (Fig. 13b); rows 1 and 3 shorter than
101

row 2, row 3, however, extends to mid-body with a monokinetidal tail composed of 1.5 urn
long bristles; longest bristles 15x1 urn in size, that is, distinctly longer and slightly thicker
than the ordinary somatic cilia, occasionally slightly inflated and/or with a thread-like
projection distally; do not beat wave-like, but simply back and forth (Fig. 13a, c, h; 302d).
Oral bulge inconspicuous, about 6 urn across and 3 urn high in vivo, centre slightly concave.
Details of infraciliature only partially recognizable in the protargol preparations, especially
the fine nematodesmata originating from oralized somatic monokinetids in the anterior region
of the ciliary rows (Fig. 13h, i; 302a-c). Thus, the oral apparatus is obviously similar to that
of E. geleii, as redescribed by FOISSNER (2000a).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at moderately saline (~ 10%o) Tunisian type
location1, at a site very near to type location1 (slightly saline, brownish sand mixed with litter
from Erica multiflora and Andromeda sp. about 200 m inshore Cape Bon, pH 7.7), and at
Namibian site (53), which is also saline, indicating that E. longitricha prefers saline soils.

representative specimen (a) and details showing mid-region of dorsal brush row 3 (c) and the cortex (d, g), which contains a
row of extrusomes (E) and several rows of granules (CG) between each two kineties. The dorsal brush bristles (B), which are
up to twice as long as the ordinary somatic cilia and thus form a conspicuous tuft, are the main feature of the species. The
fine cortical extrusomes (E) are easily overlooked! b: Shape variant. The arrowhead denotes the two ridges separating brush
rows 2 and 3; at low magnification, the ridges might be misinterpreted as an oral cleft! e: Extrusome from Tunisian

Comparison with related species: Enchelys longitricha is unique by the long
cilia of the dorsal brush, a conspicuous feature easy to recognize in vivo. Otherwise, it is
highly similar to E. vermiformis FOISSNER, 1987b and E. geleii, as redescribed by FOISSNER
(2000a). As the long dorsal bristles are hardly recognizable in the protargol preparations, live
observation is indispensable for identification. In vivo, E. longitricha may be confused with
—» Enchelyodon spp. and Apoenchelys spp., which, however, lack body extrusomes and long
dorsal brush bristles.

Paraenchelyspulchra nov. spec. (Fig. 14a-f; 303a-m; Table 14)
Diagnosis: Size about 90 x 50 urn in vivo; ovate with a length:width ratio near 1.8:1.
Extrusomes amphoriform, about 10 um long. About 60 ciliary rows.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°S 15°50'E
(site 54 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective pulchra (beautiful) refers to the pretty shape of the
extrusomes.
Description: This species was rare and did not impregnate well with protargol, except for
the extrusomes, the main diagnostic feature. Thus, morphometry is incomplete and the
description based mainly on live observation and cells impregnated with silver carbonate.
Size 70-110 x 45-55 urn in vivo, usually about 90 x 50 urn; unflattened and acontractile.
Ovoidal with narrowly rounded anterior end; occasionally an indistinct shoulder pre-
equatorially (Fig. 14a, b). Macronucleus in or near cell centre without any preferred orienta-
tion, elongate ellipsoidal to reniform; nucleoli minute. Micronucleus not found. Contractile
vacuole in posterior body end. Extrusomes (toxicysts) attached to oral bulge and scattered in
cytoplasm, impregnate with protargol and silver carbonate, except for the filiform anterior
half, which stains only faintly or not at all; thus extrusomes look different in vivo and silver
preparations, although the basic shape is still recognizable in prepared cells (compare Fig.
303i with Fig. 303c, d, f, h, k-m). Fully developed extrusomes found mainly in oral region,
10-12 urn long and basically elongate clavate or amphoriform (Fig. 14d; 3O3i): globular
posterior end about 1 urn across, gradually narrows and then widens to a fusiform mid-
portion, which transits into the filiform anterior half with a minute granule at top. Develop-
mental stages in cytoplasm lanceolate or simple club-shaped, similar to ripe extrusomes of P.
terricola FOISSNER, 1984 (Fig. 14e; 303c, d, f, h, k-m). Cortex very flexible and rather thick
because containing closely spaced rows of compact, ellipsoidal granules with a size of about
0.8 x 0.4 urn. Cytoplasm without conspicuous inclusions, usually packed with fat globules up
to 10 urn across, indicating a predatory mode of life. Swims rapidly rotating about main body
axis.
Somatic ciliary pattern as in congeners (FOISSNER 1984), as evident from silver carbonate-
impregnated specimens. About 50-70 rather distinctly spiral ciliary rows and thus very
densely ciliated (Fig. 14a; 303a, b, d, e). Dorsal brush in large subapical area, inconspicuous
because consisting of minute, scattered kinetofragments, each composed of three to six
closely spaced basal bodies bearing 2.5 urn long bristles (Fig. 303d).
Oral area slightly set off from body proper and very small compared to size of cell, that is,
only 3-4 urn across; oral opening minute and surrounded by a smooth area. No circumoral
kinety recognizable, but likely present, because the 3-4 urn wide pharyngeal basket is rather
conspicuous and extends to mid-body (Fig. 14a-c; 303e, g, j).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and in a soil sample from
the margin of a small lake (Sirkelsvlei) near Cape Town, Republic of South Africa. Thus, it is
possibly restricted to Africa or Gondwana.

105

Comparison with related species: Paraenchelys pulchra is well-defined by the
neatly-shaped extrusomes (simply drumstick-shaped in congeners) and the high number of
ciliary rows (50-70 vs. < 40). Body shape and size are similar to those of congeners and —»
Pseudoholophrya terricola. Thus, specimens must be checked for the extrusomes using high
magnification.
Paraenchelys brachyarmata nov. spec. (Fig. 15a-o; Table 15)
Diagnosis: Size about 80 x 20 urn in vivo; slenderly ovate, that is, length:width ratio
about 4:1. Extrusomes numerous and obclavate with short, rod-shaped anterior process, about
2.5 urn long. On average 20 ciliary rows, about 10 anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush.
Type location: Savannah soil near the village of El Sapo, about 50 km north of Puerto
Ayacucho, Venezuela, 07°N 67°W.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjectives brachy (short) and armatus (armed),
referring to the minuteness of the extrusomes.
Description: Size 60-100 x 15-30 urn in vivo, usually near 80 x 20 urn; slightly
flattened, acontractile. Elongate ovate, that is, length:width ratio about 4:1 in vivo, even more
variable and slender in protargol preparations, viz., 2.7-6:1, on average 5:1; often slightly
curved and, in protargol preparations, somewhat fusiform (Fig. 15a, j, m; Table 15).
Macronucleus in or near centre of cell, elongate ellipsoidal (3:1) to semicircular (4-5:1), ends
usually slightly inflated; contains many minute (< 2 jam) nucleoli; dissociated into four
globules in one out of 60 specimens. Usually one discoidal micronucleus in indentation near
or slightly above centre of macronucleus; possibly lacking in some specimens (Fig. 15a, j, o).
Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, some excretory pores in pole area. Two to eight
extrusomes, likely toxicysts, attached to oral bulge and up to 70 scattered in cytoplasm,
except for posterior quarter. Individual extrusomes drop-shaped to claviform with filiform
process occupying about half of extrusome length; minute, that is, about 2.5-3 x 0.8 urn in
vivo, but strongly refractive and thus rather easy to recognize; look similar in vivo and
protargol preparations, where they impregnate intensely, especially the posterior half (Fig.
15a-f, o). Cortex flexible, contains innumerable, colourless, minute (< 0.2 um) granules in
distinct rows; covered by bacterial rods in most Venezuelan specimens (Fig. 15g, h).
Cytoplasm colourless, contains some fat globules 1-2 urn across and many about 5 um-sized
food vacuoles with spongy, indeterminable content; prey obviously quickly digested because
not identifiable in the 60 protargol-impregnated specimens investigated. Swims rather rapidly
by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 7 urn long in vivo, rather closely spaced in oral and brush area, form bipolar,
distinctly spiralling rows slightly more closely spaced in brush region. Seven to twelve rows
modified to indistinct dorsal brush anteriorly; brush as in congeners, that is, composed of
many minute, slightly scattered kinetofragments, likely bearing minute bristles interspersed
among ordinary cilia, as described in -> Pseudoholophrya terricola. Kinetids associated with
a fibre extending posteriorly at right side of kineties (Fig. 15a, j, k, m, n; Table 15).

107

Oral area occupying anterior body end, minute, likely surrounded by a dikinetidal circumoral
kinety associated with long, fine nematodesmata forming inconspicuous oral basket hardly
recognizable in live specimens. Oral bulge extremely minute, that is, about 3 urn across and
1-1.5 urn high, has attached a bundle of extrusomes diverging posteriorly (Fig. 15a, j, k, m-
o).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and Namibian site (4), that
is, the floodplain of a river. The type location is in the floodplain of the Orinoco. Thus, P.
brachyarmata is probably not a strictly edaphic species. Very recently, we found this species
in a forest soil of Austria, showing our ignorance of even the European soil ciliate biota.
Thus, P. brachyarmata is likely a cosmopolitan.
Comparison with related species: Paraenchelys brachyarmata differs from the
congeners by the slender shape (4:1 vs. 1.6-2.3:1) and the low number of ciliary rows (about
20 vs. 30-70). Further, the extrusomes are distinctly smaller than in the other species (2-3 urn
vs. 8-15 urn), except for -> P. brachyoplites. See FOISSNER (1983b, 1984), SONG & WILBERT
(1989), and the present book for description of other species. Take care not to confuse it with
slender specimens of -» Pseudoholophrya, which have rod-shaped extrusomes.

Paraenchelys brachyoplites nov. spec. (Fig. 16a-m; Table 16)
Diagnosis: Size about 90 x 40 urn in vivo; ovate with a length:width ratio near 2.3:1.
Macronucleus almost globular. Extrusomes obclavate, 2-3 x 0.7-1 urn. On average 26 ciliary
rows, about 8 anteriorly differentiated to a dorsal brush.
Type location: Soil from the surroundings of the Ameib Guest Farm, Namib Escarp-
ment, Namibia, 21°50'S 15°35'E (site 43 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite apposition of the Latin adjective brachy (short) and the Greek
noun hoplites (soldier ~ extrusome), referring to the minuteness of the extrusomes.
Description: Size 60-110 x 25-60 urn in vivo, usually near 90 x 40 urn; up to 2:1
flattened, acontractile. Ovate to obclavate and occasionally rather distinctly curved in narrow-
side view, body length:width ratio highly variable, that is, 1.5:1 -3.5:1, on average near 2.3:1
both in vivo and protargol preparations (Fig. 16a-e; Table 16). Macronucleus usually near or
in body centre, globular to ellipsoidal (2:1), on average 17 x 13 urn in protargol preparations,
fragmented into four globular nodules in one specimen; nucleoli pale in vivo, globular to
lobate after protargol impregnation. A single micronucleus seen in a middle divider, does not
impregnate with the protargol method used in morphostatic specimens. Contractile vacuole in
posterior body end. Extrusomes attached to oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, obclavate
without filiform process, only 2-3 x 0.7-1 urn in size but compact and thus fairly distinct in
vivo; do not impregnate with the protargol method used; extruded toxicysts very transparent,
with 2-3 urn long, filiform process (Fig. 16j-m). Cortex very flexible, contains innumerable,
colourless, minute (< 0.3 urn) granules forming conspicuous, closely spaced rows. Cytoplasm
colourless, packed with fat globules 1-3 urn across and 5-7 urn-sized food vacuoles
containing bacterial remnants. Glides and swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body
axis.
Cilia about 9 urn long in vivo, closely spaced, especially in oral and brush area, form bipolar,
distinctly spiralling rows slightly more closely spaced in brush region; some kineties slightly
shortened anteriorly and/or posteriorly. About eight rows modified to indistinct dorsal brush
anteriorly; brush as in congeners and —> Pseudoholophrya terricola, that is, composed of
many minute, slightly scattered kinetofragments bearing 1-5 um long bristles interspersed
among ordinary cilia (Fig. 16a, f-h; Table 16).
Oral area occupying anterior body end, minute, likely surrounded by a dikinetidal circumoral
kinety associated with long, fine nematodesmata forming inconspicuous oral basket hardly
recognizable in live specimens. Oral bulge extremely minute, that is, about 3 urn across and 1
urn high, has a bundle of posteriorly slightly diverging extrusomes attached (Fig. 16a, f, g;
Table 16).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found in the sandy soil of the type location; in
South Africa (sandy forest soil in the Hluhluwe Game Reserve, picnic site near crocodile
pool; Fig. 16e); and in a sandy, slightly saline soil (pH 7.7) near the village of Nyalam
Togmy, Tibet, 5120 m above sea-level in the cushion plant zone (sample kindly collected by
Dr. Norbert WINDING, Salzburg). Possibly, P. brachyoplites prefers sandy soils.

Generic classification and comparison with related species:
Paraenchelys has been diagnosed as having drumstick-shaped extrusomes, while those of P.
brachyoplites are obclavate, that is, lack a filiform process. This could be considered as
sufficient to separate this species at genus level because extrusome shape is an important
feature. However, the extrusomes of P. brachyoplites are obviously the end of an evolution-
ary line ranging from P. wenzeli, which has large (15 urn) extrusomes with a conspicuous
process, over —> P. brachyarmata, where the extrusomes are as small as in P. brachyoplites,
but still have a minute process.
ill

Paraenchelys brachyoplites is likely most closely related to —> P. brachyarmata, differing
mainly in the shape of the body (broadly vs. slenderly ovate), the extrusomes (without vs.
with filiform process), and the macronucleus (broadly vs. elongate ellipsoidal). Admittedly,
these differences are not very conspicuous, but the best we have in this feature-poor group of
ciliates.
Paraenchelys terricola FOISSNER, 1984 occurs in the same sample, differing from P.
brachyoplites by the oblong macronucleus (29 x 8 urn; Table 16) and the protargol-affine,
cytoplasmic extrusomes, which show a variety of shapes and sizes (3-9 urn), indicating that
they are developmental stages. In vivo, the oral extrusomes are as described by FOISSNER
(1984), that is, drumstick-shaped, 8-10 urn long, and contain a minute granule posteriorly.
Apoenchelys nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Enchelyidae with meridional ciliary rows more or less distinctly curved
anteriorly; 2 rows differentiated to dorsal brush. Oral bulge cylindroidal, opens centrally.
Nematodesmal bundles originate from ciliated oralized somatic monokinetids in anterior
region of ciliary rows.
Type species: Apoenchelysbamforthinov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the Greek generic
name Enchelys (eel, referring to the oblong body), referring to the presumed nearest relative.
Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera: The oral basket of A. bamforthi consists of
nematodesmata originating from the monokinetids in the anterior region of the somatic
kineties, while oral dikinetids contribute to the basket of the -» Fuscheriidae and —> Acropist-
hiidae. Thus, Apoenchelys belongs to the family Enchelyidae EHRENBERG, as defined by
FOISSNER (1984), specifically, it is related to Enchelys, differing mainly by the number of
dorsal brush rows, viz., two vs. three. Admittedly, this is a rather inconspicuous generic
feature which, however, likely represents a distinct evolutionary branch because the fairly
large size of A. bamforthi excludes simple spatial constraints. The five Enchelys species
investigated in detail so far not only have three dorsal brush rows but also rod-shaped
extrusomes (FOISSNER 1984, 1987b, BERGER et al. 1984), while those of A. bamforthi are
acicular, a difference probably also of generic significance.
Apoenchelys bamforthi nov. spec. (Fig. 17a—i; Table 17)
Diagnosis: Size 145 x 30 urn in vivo; obclavate. 2 globular, almost abutting macronuclear
nodules with 1 micronucleus in between. Extrusomes acicular, about 5 um long. On average
14 ciliary rows and 17 dikinetids each in dorsal brush rows 1 and 2.
Type location: Mud and soil from granitic rock-pools of the Spitzkoppe, an inselberg in
the Namib Escarpment, Namibia, 2P45'S 15°8'E (site 41 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).

Dedication: This new species is named in honour of Prof. Dr. Stuart S. S. BAMFORTH,
Tulane University, USA, who dedicated a lifetime's research to soil protozoa.
Description: Size 100-200 x 20-40 urn in vivo, usually about 145 x 30 um, length:width
ratio also highly variable, viz., 3.4-6.7:1, on average near 5:1 in vivo and protargol prepara-
tions. More or less pronounced obclavate with anterior end distinctly narrower than widest
subequatorial body portion; unflattened and acontractile. Nuclear apparatus near or in mid-
body, conspicuous because composed of two almost abutting, globular to broadly ellipsoidal
macronuclear nodules and an ellipsoidal micronucleus in between; nucleoli scattered,
numerous, globular (Fig. 17a, d; Table 17). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, several
excretory pores in posterior pole area. Extrusomes attached to oral bulge, acicular, about 5
urn long, difficult to recognize because rather transparent; do not impregnate with the
protargol method used (Fig. 17a-c). Cortex flexible, contains closely spaced rows of
colourless granules about 1 urn across. Cytoplasm colourless, contains some fat globules up
to 5 urn across and small and large food vacuoles with remnants of naked amoebae and
ciliates. Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.

On average 14 bipolar, equidistant ciliary rows slightly curved anteriorly (Fig. 17d-h; Table
17); two rows anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush, both of about same length and
composed of an average of 17 comparatively widely spaced dikinetids. Bristles not studied in
detail.
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end, cylindroidal and about 8 urn wide in vivo, indistinctly
set off from body proper but fairly conspicuous because about 3 urn high and distinctly
depressed in centre; contains fibres originating from the anterior basal body of the ciliary
rows, as, for instance, in —> Sikorops. No circumoral kinety. Oral basket weir-like, made by
fine, moderately long nematodesmata originating from 10-15 monokinetids in anterior region
of each somatic and brush row.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, a semiterrestrial habitat,
and in a forest soil from the east slope of Mt. Kenya near the town of Nanyuki. Apoenchelys
bamforthi was very rare in both samples (one specimen per slide).
Comparison with related species: There is only one species with a similar
nuclear configuration, viz., Enchelys binucleata FOISSNER, 1983b, a limnetic, up to 75 urn
long species with a micronucleus each attached to the abutting macronuclear nodules (Fig.
17j). No similar species occur in related genera. However, there are several Enchelyodon
species and lacrymariids with a similar or identical nuclear configuration: all have a different
size, shape, and/or oral bulge.
Obliquostoma nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Enchelyidae, as defined by FOISSNER & FOISSNER (1988), with 2 dorsal brush
rows and oblique oral bulge containing fibres originating from a ring of minute granules at
bulge base. Extrusomes punctate.
Type species: Obliquostoma enchelyodontidesnov. spec.
Etymology: Composite apposition of the Latin adjective obliquo (oblique) and the Greek
noun stoma (mouth), referring to the oblique oral bulge. Neuter gender.
Comparison with related genera: The Enchelyidae have the oral basket com-
posed of fibres originating from oralized somatic monokinetids at the anterior end of the
somatic kineties; a circumoral kinety composed of dikinetids with nematodesmata, so typical
for-many gymnostomes, is absent (FOISSNER & FOISSNER 1985, 1988). Detailed data are
available on several Enchelys species showing that all have three dorsal brush rows; a rather
inconspicuous, ordinary oral bulge; and rod-shaped extrusomes (FOISSNER 1984, 1987b,
2000a). Thus, the Namibian population, which has two brush rows, an oblique oral bulge, and
ellipsoidal extrusomes, is referred to a new genus, Obliquostoma.
Certainly, Obliquostoma has considerable similarities with —> Sikorops, especially in
possessing distinct bulge fibres. But Obliquostoma is unique in that the bulge fibres originate
only from a ring of minute, lightly impregnating granules, likely not basal bodies. Such
granules and fibres are present also in Sikorops, which has, however, an additional fibre
originating from the kinetid, likely a dikinetid, at the anterior end of the ciliary rows (cp. Fig.
115

18j, k). Unfortunately, bulge fibres have not been described in Enchelys spp. We re-studied
the slides from E. gasterosteus and E. polynucleata, both described in FOISSNER (1984; note
that E. polynucleata was wrongly assigned to the genus Enchelydium in this study). Neither
bulge fibres, nor a lightly impregnated granule ring, so typical for Obliquostoma, are
recognizable, but transmission electron microscopy shows fibres originating from the
anteriormost basal body of each ciliary row (FOISSNER & FOISSNER 1985). Thus,
Obliquostoma must be considerably different from Enchelys. This needs, however, substan-
tiation by electron microscopy.
Obliquostoma enchelyodontides nov. spec. (Fig. 18a—j; 304a-i; Table 18)
Diagnosis: Size about 55x18 urn in vivo; oblong with oral bulge occupying one quarter
of widest trunk region. Macronucleus C-shaped. Micronucleus about 5 urn across, attached to
anterior end of macronuclear figure. Ripe extrusomes broadly fusiform, about 2x1 urn. On
average 16 ciliary rows. Brush row 1 about twice as long as row 2, consists of an average of
11, respectively, 5 dikinetids.
Type location: Soil from the surroundings of the Ameib Guest Farm, Namib Escarp-
ment, Namibia, 21°50'S 15°35'E (site 43 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of Enchelyodon and the Greek suffix ides (look like), referring to
the similarity with species of the genus Enchelyodon.
Description: Size 45-65 x 15-22 urn in vivo, usually near 55 x 18 urn, laterally slightly
flattened, up to 20% contractile under mild cover glass pressure. Shape inconspicuous, that is,
elongate ovate and slightly asymmetrical (Fig. 18a, e; 304a, c, e; Table 18). Macronucleus on
average in posterior body half, usually roughly C-shaped, occasionally tortuous rod-shaped or
almost circular, ends often slightly inflated; nucleoli globular, small and numerous. Micro-
nucleus conspicuous because invariably at anterior curve of macronucleus and 4-5 um across
in vivo; with distinct membrane and some indeterminable internal structures (Fig. 18a, f, g;
304d, e). Contractile vacuole in rear end, some excretory pores in posterior pole area.
Extrusomes in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, broadly fusiform, 1.7-2.2 x 0.7-1 urn in
vivo (Fig. 18a-c; Table 18); ripe organelles do not impregnate with the protargol method
used, while two to five cytoplasmic extrusomes, obviously a late (because of similar size and
shape as the oral extrusomes) developmental stage, stain rather deeply. Cortex highly flexible,
contains pale, minute (< 0.3 urn) granules so loosely arranged that rows are hardly recogniz-
able. Cytoplasm colourless, contains many bright fat globules 1—4 urn across and some 6 (un-
sized food vacuoles with loose content. Food not known, likely other ciliates. Glides and
swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 8 \am long in vivo, arranged in bipolar, equidistant rows densely ciliated and
slightly curved in anterior region; distances between individual kinetids increase distinctly
from anterior to posterior. Two kineties differentiated to moderately conspicuous dorsal brush
in anterior third. Dikinetidal portion of brush row 1 about twice as long as that of row 2,
which has a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to posterior body end; both rows separated
by an about 2 urn high crest slightly projecting from body surface when cell is viewed

laterally (Fig. 18g); anterior bristle of pairs about 3 um long and slightly inflated distally,
posterior about 2 urn long and rod-shaped (Fig. 18a, d-g, i, j; 304a-i; Table 18).
Oral bulge 5-7 urn width and up to 4 um high in vivo, likely slightly contracted in the
protargol preparations, higher right than left laterally and thus conspicuously oblique, while
button-shaped (symmetrical, enchelyodontid) when viewed laterally; circular to broadly
obovate in frontal view, centre slightly depressed. No ordinary circumoral kinety, but a ring
of minute (about half the size of ordinary somatic basal bodies), lightly impregnated granules
associated with fibres extending spirally to bulge centre. Ciliary rows commence underneath
granule ring, likely with a ciliated monokinetid because any indication of a dikinetid is
lacking. Oral basket composed of nematodesmata originating from about ten somatic kinetids
at anterior end of each ciliary row, including the dorsal brush, where the posterior basal body
of a pair usually has a long basket rod; nematodesmata obliquely spread to body midline,
forming a rather conspicuous basket (Fig. 18a, b, e-g, i, j; 304d-i; Table 18).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rare in
the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Comparison with related species: Obliquostoma enchelyodontides is an
inconspicuous ciliate. In spite of this, it is readily identified, both in vivo and silver prepara-
tions, by the oblique oral bulge, the curious location of the micronucleus, and the ellipsoidal
extrusomes. No species was found in the literature that could be identical to our population.

Obliquostoma namibiense nov. spec. (Fig. 19a-f; 304j, k; Table 18)
Diagnosis: Size about 65 x 20 \im in vivo; oblong with oral bulge occupying one quarter
of widest trunk region. Macronucleus C-shaped with micronucleus attached at variable
positions and about 5 urn across. Ripe extrusomes amphoriform, about 2x1 urn. On average
15 ciliary rows. Brush row 1 about twice as long as row 2, consists of an average of 9,
respectively, 5 dikinetids.
Type location: Litter from Combretum imberbe (leadwood tree) at foot of the
Brandberg, an inselberg at the east margin of the central Namib Desert, Namibia, 21°S
14°35'E (site 48 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.

Description and comparison with related species: This species, as yet
found only at type location, is highly similar to O. enchelyodontides, except for the extru-
somes, which are amphoriform in the former and ellipsoidal in the latter. We consider this as
the main feature of O. namibiense because extrusome shape hardly varies and is generally an
important feature in haptorid gymnostomes.
As O. namibiense is highly similar to O. enchelyodontides, the reader is referred to the
detailed description of this species, the figures, and the morphometric data. The following
minor differences occur: (i) Obliquostoma namibiense is slightly larger and more distinctly
slanted subapically than O. enchelyodontides; (ii) the location of the micronucleus varies; (iii)
the cytoplasmic extrusomes do not, or only lightly, impregnate; (iv) dorsal brush ridges likely
lacking or inconspicuous; (v) dorsal bristles rod-shaped and up to 5 urn long in row 1.
In vivo, Obliquostoma spp. are easily confused with several small Enchelyodon, Sikorops,
and Spathidium species, especially Spathidium claviforme (extrusomes rod-shaped!). Thus,
identifications should be checked by protargol impregnation.

Enchelyodontidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Cylindroidal, acontractile Spathidiida with meridionally extending ciliary
rows and circular or elliptical circumoral kinety at anterior end. Oral bulge usually conspicu-
ous, hemispherical, cylindroidal, or plate-like. Dorsal brush composed of 3 rows of dikinetids;
row 3 with monokinetidal bristle tail.
Type genus: Enchelyodon CLAPAREDE& LACHMANN, 1859.
Remarks: Enchelyodon was classified with the Enchelyidae by CORLISS (1979) and the
Trachelophyllidae by FoiSSNER (1984). However, Enchelys has a fundamentally different oral
infraciliature, that is, has oralized somatic monokinetids and lacks oral dikinetids (FOISSNER
1984, FOISSNER & FOISSNER 19852). The -> Trachelophyllidae are here raised to subordinal
rank and restricted to genera with epicortical scales. Thus, the remaining genera are referred
to a new family, Enchelyodontidae, as diagnosed above.
The Enchelyodontidae comprise at least two genera: Enchelyodon (with hemispherical or
plate-like, "closed" oral bulge) and Enchelydium (with cylindroidal, "open" oral bulge), as
described below.
Enchelydium blätteren nov. spec. (Fig. 20a-t; 305a-z, 306a-o; Table 19)
Diagnosis: Size about 240 x 100 urn in vivo. Macronucleus vermiform. Two size types
(30 urn and 50 urn) of rod-shaped extrusomes in oral bulge and posterior body third, where
they form about 12 distinct, equidistant bundles. On average 110 ciliary rows. Oral bulge
circular, in vivo about 40 urn across and 10 urn high. Resting cysts with conspicuous,
hemispherical blisters.
Type location: Soil from Murray River floodplain near Albury at the landside of Ryans
road, Australia, 37°S 147°E.
Dedication: Dedicated to Mag. Hubert BLATTERER, a former student of Prof. FOISSNER,
who collected the sample and performed the first detailed study on Australian soil ciliates
(BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1988).
Description: Size 200-280 x 70-120 urn in vivo, usually around 240 x 100 urn.
Bursiform to cylindroidal and slightly curved, resembling a thick, swimming sausage,
dorsally often more convex than ventrally and thus slightly asymmetrical. Posterior end
broadly rounded, anterior transverse truncate due to thick, cylindroidal oral bulge (Fig. 20a, b;
305k, i; Table 19). Cells opaque and brownish at low magnification (< xlOO) due to large size
and food inclusions. Macronucleus vermiform and tortuous, on average slightly longer than
cell, occasionally in two pieces of varying length. About 10 micronuclei along macronucleus,
2 The Enchelydium polynucleatum in this paper belongs to Enchelys, as explained in the generic classification
of Enchelydium blätteren.
121

in vivo approximately 4 urn across, in protargol preparations difficult to distinguish from
similarly sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 20a, k; 305a, c, p). Contractile
vacuole in posterior body end, 6-9 pores in unciliated pole centre. Cortex very flexible, bright
and 2-3 urn thick due to a dense layer of mucocysts, in protargol preparations separated from
cytoplasm by a sharply impregnated sheet, likely the well-developed tela corticalis (Fig. 20a,
m; 305a, c). Mucocysts about 2 x 1 urn in vivo, tightly spaced forming bright layer in entire
cortex, including outer and inner wall of oral bulge, released when methyl green-pyronin is
added, swell to about 5 urn long, irregularly curved rods forming a more of less compact
envelope (Fig. 20a, f, g; 305a, c-e). Two size-types of rod-shaped, fine extrusomes (toxicysts)
in oral bulge and cytoplasm, where they form about 12 conspicuous, subcortical bundles in
posterior body third, produce dense lattice over oral opening when partially extruded, become
black and irregularly curved in silver carbonate preparations, while only the proximal, toxin-
containing portion impregnates with protargol. Size type I about 50 x 0.6 urn, slightly curved,
very numerous and flexible; size type II, possibly only a developmental stage of type I, about
30 x 1 urn, more strongly curved than type I (Fig. 20a, c, e, k; 305a-c, o, w-y, 306n). Cytoplasm
packed with fat globules 1-12 urn across, a few large food vacuoles, and some 5-10 um-sized
vacuoles with granular contents (Fig. 20a; 305a). Feeds mainly on medium-sized ciliates
(Meseres corlissi, Colpoda lucida, Plagiocampa rouxi), which are ingested whole and move
in the food vacuoles for some time; occasionally, flagellates and brown fungal conidia were
observed in the food vacuoles, possibly from prey organisms. Movement of field specimens
very conspicuous, that is, rapidly and jerkily pushing, giving the impression of intense search
for prey; cultivated specimens often swim slowly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia 10-12 urn long in vivo, closely spaced, especially underneath oral bulge, and thus
forming beautiful metachronal waves; arranged in meridional rows at left margin of flat
cortical ridges, abut on circumoral kinety, three rows anteriorly differentiated to inconspicu-
ous, dikinetidal dorsal brush. Brush rows in rather deep furrows, respectively, separated by
about 1 urn wide ridges, kinetids much more closely spaced than in ordinary ciliary rows;
rows 1 and 2 extend with unciliated monokinetids to posterior third of cell, producing an
about 3 ^m wide, blank stripe (Fig. 305 1). Brush row 1 slightly shorter than row 2, dikinetids
with slightly inflated bristles gradually decreasing in length from 6 urn anteriorly to 1 urn
posteriorly; posterior bristle of dikinetids only 2 urn long anteriorly and 0.5 urn posteriorly.
Row 3 like rows 1 and 2 anteriorly, extends with 3-4 urn long, monokinetidal bristles to
posterior third of cell; bristles acicular and straight in vivo, rod-shaped and curved posteriorly
in SEM preparations (Fig. 20a, d, k, 1; 305 1, p, r-v; Table 19).
Oral apparatus at anterior end of cell and very conspicuous due to the large, cavernous oral
bulge making cells appear as if swimming with an open mouth (Fig. 20a, k; 305g-j), as
already emphasized by KAHL (1930a, b); cavity, however, covered with pellicle, mouth thus
not truly open. Oral bulge cylindroidal because hemispherically or obconically hollowed in
centre, as described above; in vivo circular and about 40 urn across and 10 |im high, in
protargol slides slightly widened (Table 19), while shrunken to about 30 urn (15-25 urn in the
small, cultivated specimens) in SEM preparations; can contract and extend by about half of its
ordinary width to become higher, respectively, flatter; consists of a lamellar, anastomosing
material and contains anterior end of extrusomes and fine fibres forming an inner basket (Fig.
19n; 305m, n, w, x). Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of very closely
spaced kinetids (likely dikinetids) with about 10 urn long cilia. Oral basket conspicuous because

bodies of the somatic ciliary rows. The oral bulge of Enchelydium is ring-shaped, that is, has a conspicuous central opening
(Fig. 3O5g-j), while that of Enchelys is only slightly depressed and closed (Fig. 305z). o-s: Enchelydium thecatum differs
from E. blätteren mainly by body size (100-130 um vs. 200-280 urn), the oral bulge (cleft-like vs. cylindroidal), and the
mucilaginous envelope, which is lacking in E. blätteren. KAHL (1926, 1930a, b) studied E. thecatum several times and

Blisters brownish and foam-like, that is, consisting of a large, central vacuole surrounded by
about 10 smaller vacuoles (306d, f, h); blister wall about 0.5 urn thick and composed of
fibrous material with numerous, scattered pores, very much like filter paper (306k-m);
individual blisters on average 14 urn high and connected by star-like extensions of wall fibres
(306i, j; Table 19). Cyst wall proper about 1 urn thick, brownish, flexible. Encysted cell often
separated from cyst wall by a more or less wide, hyaline zone and packed with fat globules 1-
10 jam across.

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location. The sample was a
mixture of leaf litter (mainly from red gum trees and dried Myriophyllum) and light brown
soil, pH 5.2. It contained a very rich (about 80 species) mixture of limnetic and euedaphic
ciliate species.
Enchelydium blätteren could be cultivated in Eau de Volvic with Colpoda lucida and
Meseres corlissi as food source. However, cultures did not grow well and specimens became
smaller (150-200 urn) and died out after about two months. Tetrahymena mobilis, Parame-
cium aurelia, and Blepharisma americanum were not ingested.
The peculiar resting cysts could help to escape the strong sedimentation common in flood-
plain environments. The large blisters might increase buoyancy of the cyst and facilitate
distribution of the species by floatation.
Comparison with related species: Few Enchelydium species have been described
since KAHL (1930a), and most very likely belong to other genera (see below). All species are
small (length < 100 um) and have one or two macronuclear nodules, except for E. thecatum
KAHL, 1926, which is 100-130 urn long and has, like E. blätteren, a vermiform macro-
nucleus (Fig. 20o-s). KAHL (1926, 1930a, b) studied two populations of E. thecatum. Both
were distinctly smaller than E. blätteren, had an elongate-ellipsoidal oral bulge, and produced
a mucilaginous case. A case was not observed in E. blätteren, not even in cultures, where
specimens moved incessantly; however, when cells were irritated, they released their
mucocysts producing a more or less voluminous cover (305c-f), indicating that they were not
fundamentally different from E. thecatum in this respect. Thus, the considerable size
difference (100-130 urn vs. 200-300 urn) and the shape of the oral bulge (elongate ellipsoidal
vs. circular) are the main distinguishing features of E. thecatum and E. blätteren at the
present state of knowledge; very likely, the number of ciliary rows is highly different, too.
Furthermore, E. thecatum apparently lacks the terminal extrusome bundles, which are so
conspicuous in E. blätteren (Fig. 20a, o-s; 305n).
Generic classification: The Australian ciliate perfectly matches the genus Enche-
lydium, as defined by KAHL (1930a, b), that is, has a very conspicuous, ring-shaped oral bulge
making specimens look as if swimming with an open mouth (Fig. 20a; 305g, h, k). The
infraciliature, described here for the first time, is simple and very similar to that of Enchelyo-
don, as shown by FOISSNER (1984). Thus, the oral bulge (ring-shaped vs. button-shaped or
plate-like) is the sole distinguishing feature. Both genera belong to the spathidiids, as already
proposed by KAHL (1930a, b), and are fundamentally different from Enchelys, which lacks
oral dikinetids (see introduction to family and Fig. 20t).
The "open mouth" of Enchelydium, although being very conspicuous,- is difficult to-imagine
without appropriate scanning electron micrographs (305g-j). Thus, and because details of the
infraciliature of Enchelydium were unknown, FOISSNER (1984) misclassified an Enchelys
species in Enchelydium: Enchelys polynucleata (FOISSNER, 1984) nov. comb, (basionym:
Enchelydium polynucleatum FOISSNER, 1984). Spathidium piliforme KAHL, 1930b, as
redescribed and transferred to Enchelydium by FOISSNER (1984), either belongs to Enchelys
or Sikorops FOISSNER, 1999b. Likewise, Enchelydium alpinum FOISSNER, 1980d and E. simile
FOISSNER, 1980d belong to Enchelys or Spathidium. However, a definite assignment of these
taxa should await more detailed data on the infraciliature.

Enchelyodon kenyaensis nov. spec. (Fig. 21a, b, e-j; Table 20)
Diagnosis: Size about 130 x 20 urn in vivo; obclavate to cylindroidal. Macronucleus a
long strand. Extrusomes rod-shaped, about 10 urn long. About 16 ciliary rows. Brush kinety 3
composed of few dikinetids and a monokinetidal bristle extending to mid-body.
Type location: Highly saline, alkaline (pH 8.5) soil from the Buffalo Springs National
Reserve, Kenya, 00°40'S 27°30'E.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: This species is difficult to study because the cortical granules usually
impregnate and hide the infraciliature. Thus, morphometry is incomplete.
Size 80-160 x 15-30 urn in vivo, usually near 130 x 20 urn, length:width ratio 3-7.5:1, on
average 5:1 in protargol preparations; up to 2:1 flattened. Claviform to almost cylindroidal,
oral bulge distinctly set off from body proper (Fig. 21a, b, e, f; Table 20). Very flexible and
up to 20% contractile under slight cover glass pressure. Macronucleus a long, slightly
tortuous strand with inflated ends and many small nucleoli, usually in posterior body thirds,
occasionally constricted in mid-region. Several globular micronuclei along and near macro-
nucleus. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, likely with single excretory pore in pole
centre. Extrusomes attached to oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, rod-shaped and slightly
curved, about 10 urn long (Fig. 21j). Cortex very flexible, distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows,
contains rows of minute (< 0.5 urn) granules that usually impregnate with the protargol
method used. Cytoplasm colourless, contains some fat globules 2-A urn across and large food
vacuoles likely with ciliate remnants. Swims and glides moderately rapidly showing worm-
like flexibility.
Cilia about 8 um long in vivo, arranged in about 16 meridional, equidistant rows slightly
more densely ciliated in posterior than anterior half of cell. Three rows anteriorly differen-
tiated to short, inconspicuous dorsal brush composed of dikinetids bearing about 4 urn long
bristles. Brush row 1 slightly shorter than row 2, each composed of at least 10 dikinetids, row
3 consists of only two anterior dikinetids followed by a monokinetidal tail with about 3 urn
long bristles; tail extends to second third of body, where it changes to an ordinary somatic
kinety (Fig. 21a, f-i).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end, distinctly set off from body proper and thus conspicu-
ous, slightly obliquely truncate anteriorly, contains anterior end of extrusomes. Circumoral
kinety at base of oral bulge, distinctly set off from somatic ciliary rows, composed of oblique
dikinetids each associated with a cilium and an oral basket rod. Oral basket obconical,
extends to second third of body, hardly recognizable in live specimens (Fig. 21a, b, f-h).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rare in
the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Comparison with related species: See —» Enchelyodon armatides. Briefly, E.
kenyaensis and E. armatides differ in the shape of the extrusomes (rod-shaped vs. acicular).

Enchelyodon armatides nov. spec. (Fig. 22a-n, 23a-l; 307c-f; Table 21)
Diagnosis: Size about 160 x 30 urn in vivo; obclavate to almost cylindroidal. Macro-
nucleus a long, tortuous strand. Extrusomes acicular, about 18 urn long. On average 15 ciliary
rows, 3 anteriorly modified to dorsal brush: rows 1 and 2 of about same length, each
consisting of about 15 dikinetids; row 3 composed of only about 4 dikinetids, but with
monokinetidal bristle tail extending to mid-body.
Type location: Litter from Combretum imberbe (leadwood tree) at foot of the
Brandberg, an inselberg at the east margin of the central Namib Desert, Namibia, 21°S
14°35'E (site 48 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective armatus (armed) and the Latin suffix ides
(similar), meaning a ciliate similar to Enchelyodon armatus KAHL.
Description: Although the populations studied match well in all main features, the
diagnosis contains only the Namibian population, mainly because the other specimens are
from different biogeographic regions. The few differences found are mentioned in the
description and/or are recognizable in table 21. Generally, the species is highly similar to -»
E. kenyaensis, differing mainly in the shape of the extrusomes (acicular vs. rod-like).
Size 120-200 x 25-40 urn, usually near 160 x 30 urn, length:width ratio 3.5-6.8:1, on
average 5.2:1 in protargol preparations; size and shape of Australian specimens similar to
those of Namibian type material in vivo, while considerably smaller (109 x 24 um vs. 143 x
28 urn) and stouter (4.3:1 vs. 5.2:1) in the protargol preparations (Table 21), likely because
they are more contractile than the Namibian cells. Australian specimens flattened up to 2:1
130

and about 30% contracted when removed from the culture and transferred on the microscope
slide, slowly extend to become cylindroidal during the next 10 min (Fig. 22f-h). Shape
similar in both populations, viz., obclavate to almost cylindroidal and often slightly curved;
inconspicuously inflated subapically, where the thick portion of the extrusomes is located
(Fig. 22a, f-j, n). Macronucleus usually in posterior two thirds of cell, filiform and tortuous,
ends frequently slightly inflated and/or coiled; nucleoli globular to lobate. Micronuclei along
and near macronucleus, broadly ellipsoidal about 3 urn in size, often difficult to discern
because of many similarly sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole
in posterior end, excretory pores not recognizable in the protargol preparations. Ripe
extrusomes form a conspicuous bundle attached to the oral bulge, individual toxicysts
acicular and rather distinctly curved, about 18 urn (Namibian specimen), respectively, 10-13
urn long (Australian specimens), do not impregnate with protargol, while a certain cytoplas-
mic developmental stage impregnates deeply (Fig. 22a, c, d; 307c, d). Cortex very flexible,
contains about 10 rows of minute, colourless granules between each two kineties. Cytoplasm
colourless, usually packed with fat globules up to 7 urn across in posterior body half. Feeds
on heterotrophic flagellates and small ciliates, digested rapidly because food vacuoles are
rarely seen. Swims and glides rather rapidly showing great flexibility.
Cilia 6 urn long (8-10 urn in Australian specimens) in vivo, arranged in an average of 15 (16
in Australian specimens) meridional, equidistant rows loosely ciliated in anterior third. Three
rows anteriorly differentiated to short, inconspicuous dorsal brush composed of dikinetids
bearing up to 4 urn long, distally slightly inflated bristles. Brush rows 1 and 2 of about same
length, each composed of about 15 dikinetids (18 in Australian specimens); row 3 consists of
only four anterior dikinetids followed by a monokinetidal tail extending to mid-body with
about 2 urn long, tongue-shaped bristles (Fig. 22a, b, k, m, n; 307e, f; Table 21).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end, conspicuous because comparatively large (6-8 x 3-4
urn in vivo) and distinctly set off from body proper, appearing button-like at low (xlOO)
magnification, contains anterior end of extrusomes and an x-shaped, fibrillar structure
extending into the oral basket. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, distinctly set off from
somatic ciliary rows, composed of oblique dikinetids each associated with a cilium and an
oral basket rod. Oral basket obconical, extends in anterior fifth of body, hardly recognizable
in live specimens (Fig. 22a, f-m; 307c, e, f; Table 21).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and in Australia (soil from
Botanical Garden in Darwin, Northern Territory); associated with Spathidium aciculare at
both sites. Enchelyodon armatides is a slender species and thus well adapted to live in soil.
Comparison with related species: This and the following species show consider-
able similarity to Trachelophyllum s. 1., especially in body and extrusome shape and size, the
slight contractility, and the almost complete reduction of dorsal brush row 3. However, the
nuclear pattern is different and epicortical scales are lacking, indicating that the similarities
evolved convergently or are plesiomorphies.
Enchelyodon armatides is very similar to E. kenyaensis, differing only by the shape of the
extrusomes (acicular vs. rod-shaped). However, extrusome shape is fairly constant in haptorid
gymnostomes and thus an important species character. Further, there exists another similar
species with rod-shaped extrusomes but many macronuclear nodules. Thus, the acicular
extrusome type likely represents a different evolutionary line and species.

b Approximations.
Both Enchelyodon armatides and E. kenyaensis are rather similar to E. armatus (KAHL,
1926), KAHL, 1930a, of which KAHL once found large numbers in a road ditch near Hamburg,
Germany. However, KAHL'S organism is considerably smaller (100 urn vs. 120-160 urn) and
stouter (3:1 vs. 4.3-5.2:1, on average) than our species, and the monokinetidal bristle tail of
brush row 3 extends above mid-body (Fig. 21c, d —> E. kenyaensis); furthermore, it is from a
limnetic habitat. Thus, it appears justified to separate the terrestrial populations as distinct
species.
Further similar species: Enchelyodon vorax (PENARD, 1922) KAHL, 1930a, b (length 200-360
urn vs. 150-200 |im, length:width ratio 3.3:1 vs. 4.3-5.2:1); Enchelyodon nodosus BERGER et
al., 1984 (extrusomes 30 urn vs. 10-18 urn, 76 vs. 16 ciliary rows); and E. tratzi FOISSNER,
1987b (highly similar, but macronucleus in 20 scattered nodules). Beginners may also
confuse E. armatides and E. kenyaensis with Trachelophyllum s. 1.; these, however, invaria-
bly have two macronuclear nodules.
Description of a population from Tenerife: Some months after we had
finished the description, we recognized that this species occurs in soils globally, except of
Antarctica. The notes made show that E. armatides invariably has an average size of between
135

150 um and 200 um and acicular extrusomes. The observations on the extrusomes will be
reported in some detail because we consider them as an important feature in alpha-taxonomy
of haptorid gymnostomes. Spain: acicular, 12-17 x 0.8-1 um (Fig. 23h); Namibian site 49:
acicular, 15 x 0.8-1 urn (Fig. 23i); Tenerife: acicular, 15x1 um (Fig. 23g); Saudi Arabia:
acicular, length 17—21 urn; Republic of South Africa: only slightly acicular, 15 urn long (Fig.
23j); Colombia (South America): acicular, 20-30 urn long; additionally 3 urn long, rod-
shaped extrusomes occur, as in many haptorids (Fig. 23k). Obviously, extrusome shape is
very similar in all populations (see also specimens from Namibia and Australia described
above!), while length varies from 10-20 (30) urn; the Colombian population might be a
distinct species or subspecies, and the extrusomes of the South African specimens are rather
similar to those of E. kenyaensis.
The Tenerife E. armatides matches the Namibian and Australian specimens, as evident from a
comparison of the figures (Fig. 22a-n, 23a—1) and the morphometric data (Table 21). Thus,
conspecificity is beyond reasonable doubt. The following additional observations were made:
(i) length usually near 150 urn; (ii) contractile by up to 30% and thus often stouter in
preparations than in vivo; (iii) macronucleus rarely strongly tortuous, ends not inflated; (i)
several excretory pores in posterior pole area; (v) extrusomes acicular, about 15 x 1 urn,
found not only in oral bulge but also in rear end (Fig. 23a, h); (vi) cortex distinctly furrowed
by ciliary rows; (vii) creeps slowly, worm-like; (viii) cilia about 7 urn long; (ix) dorsal brush
highly differentiated, especially row 3, with up to 6 um long bristles (Fig. 23 1); (x) oral and
neck area hyaline, oral bulge distinctly set off from body proper.
Enchelyodon minutus nov. spec. (Fig. 24a-h; Table 22)
Diagnosis: Size about 60 x 15 um in vivo; cylindroidal with distinct oral bulge. Macro-
nucleus reniform. Oral extrusomes rod-shaped and fine, about 3 urn long. On average 10
somatic kineties with cilia very loosely spaced and approximately 14 urn long in vivo; 3 rows
anteriorly modified to dorsal brush having up to 8 urn long bristles; rows 1 and 2 each
composed of seven dikinetids, row 3 of three.
Type location: Mud from granitic rock-pools in a stream of the Daan Viljoen Game
Park near Windhoek, Namibia, 22°35'S 17°05'E (site 73 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective minuta (small) refers to the small size of the organism.
Description: Size 45-90 x 12-20 (am in vivo, length:width ratio 3.1-5.6:1, on average
4:1 in protargol preparations. Shape cylindroidal to more or less distinctly clavate, both ends
moderately broadly rounded (Fig. 24a, c, f, h; Table 22); unflattened and acontractile.
Macronucleus in mid-body on average, ellipsoidal or reniform, rarely C-shaped. Micro-
nucleus broadly ellipsoidal, usually attached to concave side of macronucleus. Contractile
vacuole in rear body end, with single excretory pore in pole centre. Extrusomes attached to
oral bulge, rod-shaped, about 3—4 x 0.2-0.3 urn in size; do not impregnate with protargol,
except of posterior third, which is occasionally black (Fig. 24a, e, f). Cortex very flexible and
thin, apparently without granules. Cytoplasm colourless, usually packed with fat globules up
to 5 urn across, indicating a predatory mode of life. Swims rather rapidly by rotation about
main body axis.

Cilia very widely spaced (6-7 urn) and long, namely, 14-15 urn in vivo and 9-11 um in
protargol-impregnated cells (Fig. 24a); arranged in an average of ten equidistant, meridional
rows distinctly shortened anteriorly, except of brush rows, which abut to the circumoral
kinety; some unciliated kinetids interspersed. Dorsal brush three-rowed, although minute
rather conspicuous because bristles up to 8 urn long; each row of different fine structure (Fig.
24a, b, d): row 1 composed of an average of seven dikinetids having 1 urn (anterior bristle) or
2 (im (posterior) long, inflated bristles; row 2 composed of an average of seven dikinetids
having rod-shaped bristles gradually increasing in length from 2 urn anteriorly to 8 urn
posteriorly; row 3 composed of only three dikinetids with bristles that also lengthen posteri-
orly, continues to mid-body with a monokinetidal tail composed of 3 um long bristles.
Oral bulge rather conspicuous in vivo because about 6 urn wide and 3 urn high, slightly
oblique, contains extrusomes as described above. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge,
continuous, that is, composed of closely spaced dikinetids each with one basal body ciliated.
Oral basket not recognizable either in vivo or protargol preparations (Fig. 24a, c, f; Table 22).

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rare in
the non-flooded Petri dish culture. The biological meaning of the long cilia is obscure.
Generic classification and comparison with related specimen: This
population is difficult to classify. It belongs either to Enchelyodon, —» Spathidium, or
Rhopalophrya. An enchelyodontid relationship is indicated by the general appearance,
specifically, the button-shaped oral bulge on a cylindroidal trunk with meridional ciliary rows.
However, the oral bulge is slightly oblique and the ciliary rows do not abut to the circumoral
kinety, suggesting that our species is a highly modified SpathidiumlArcuospathidium. Three
similar Spathidium species are mentioned in KAHL (1930a): Spathidium lagyniforme (length
100 urn; infraciliature distinctly different, according to the redescription by FoiSSNER 1984);
Spathidium vermiculus (matches almost perfectly, except for the cilia, which are short and
numerous); and Spathidium cylindricum (also rather similar, but cortex distinctly and spirally
furrowed and extrusomes 6 urn long).
Our species also resembles Rhopalophrya crassa KAHL, 1926, -a poorly known genus and
species, which, however, has a globular macronucleus and a more distinct shoulder under the
oral bulge. Actually, there are many more small ciliates resembling Enchelyodon minutus;
most are poorly known, and thus any identification is difficult. Thus, we emphasize the
extraordinarily long cilia, compared to body size, a feature not shared with any other species.
Enchelyodon megastoma nov. spec. (Fig. 25a-g; Table 23)
Diagnosis: Size about 200 x 100 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal to slightly dumb-bell-shaped.
Macronucleus almost twice as long as cell and tortuous. Two size types (25 urn, 12 urn) of
fine, rod-shaped oral extrusomes. About 130 ciliary rows, 3 differentiated to dorsal brush
extending to mid-body. Oral basket broadly conical, distal diameter about 70 urn in vivo.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Apposition of the Greek prefix mega (very large) and the Greek noun stoma
(mouth), referring to the extraordinarily large oral basket.
Description: Size 150-260 x 65-150 urn in vivo, usually near 200 x 100 urn;
length.width ratio rather stable, that is, about 2:1 both in vivo and protargol preparations
(Table 23). Cells opaque and brownish at low magnification (< xlOO). Outline slightly dumb-
bell-shaped to elliptical, with anterior region usually slightly broader than posterior; unflat-
tened, acontractile (Fig. 25a, e). Macronucleus conspicuous because almost twice as long as
cell and strongly tortuous; rarely in two tortuous pieces of unequal length. Micronuclei 2-3
urn across, attached and near macronucleus, exact number difficult to count because of many
similar-sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole in rear body end.
Two size types of rod-shaped, fine extrusomes in oral basket and cytoplasm, do not impreg-
nate with protargol, except of certain cytoplasmic developmental stages (Fig. 25a, b): type I
slightly curved and about 20-30 x 0.4 urn in size; type II straight with pointed ends, about 12
x 0.4 urn in size. Cortex flexible, contains countless moderately refractive, about 1 x 0.4 um-

sized granules, likely mucocysts, so densely spaced that a plate-like structure results, which
appears as a conspicuously bright, approximately 2 urn thick fringe under bright field
illumination (Fig. 25a, f, g). Cytoplasm rather opaque due to many granules 0.2-3 urn across
and 10-25 um-sized food vacuoles containing remnants from bacteria and heterotrophic
flagellates (Polytomella); interestingly, ciliates were not observed in the food vacuoles neither
in vivo or protargol preparations. Movement conspicuous because jerky and rather quick.
As the species was rare, the infraciliature could be studied only in 10 poorly impregnated
specimens. Accordingly, data are incomplete, especially morphometrics. Cilia about 12 jam
long in vivo, narrowly spaced and thus forming nice metachronal waves, arranged in an
average of approximately 130 meridional, equidistantly spaced rows abutting to circumoral
kinety; three rows differentiated to a long dorsal brush extending from circumoral kinety to
mid-body. Dorsal brush of ordinary structure, row 3 likely with a monokinetidal tail, anterior
bristles of dikinetids shorter than posterior ones, bristles decrease in length from about 5 urn
anteriorly to 1 urn posteriorly (Fig. 25a, c, d; Table 23).
Oral basket occupies anterior body end, highly conspicuous because extraordinarily large and
strongly refractive due to the many extrusomes contained, which form a short, but very
distinct, broadly conical assemblage (Fig. 25a, d; Table 23). Oral bulge in vivo circular and
about 70 urn (!) across, but rather inconspicuous because flat and only 2-3 urn high.
Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly spaced granules, likely dikinetids, each associated
with an about 45 urn long nematodesma; neighbouring nematodesmata form conspicuous
bundles producing a comparatively short, broadly conical oral basket (Fig. 25a, d).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was very rare
and present only a few days in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. The blunt shape indicates
that E. megastoma is a limnetic species.

Generic classification and comparison with related species: Enche-
lyodon megastoma looks like a large prostomatid, e.g., Holophrya teres. However, the
structure of the oral basket, the oral extrusomes, and the dorsal brush show that it belongs to
the haptorid gymnostomes. Within that group, the Namibian population looks like an
undescribed genus, if compared to "ordinary" Enchelyodon species, such as —> E. armatides
and —» E. minutus. However, the structure of the oral bulge and dorsal brush basically match
Enchelyodon. Indeed, E. megastoma looks highly similar to —> Enchelydium blätteren, except
of the flat oral bulge. A spathidiid relationship is excluded by the circular oral opening and
the somatic kineties, which are not curved anteriorly.
Enchelyodon megastoma is a highly characteristic species and thus easy to identify. We did
not find a similar species in the literature. On superficial observation, it may be confused with
—» Holophrya salinarum and other prostomatids.
Trachelophyllina novus subordo
Diagnosis: Spathidiida FOISSNER & FoiSSNER, 1988 with epicortical scales.
Type family: Trachelophyllidae KENT, 1881.
Remarks: There are several genera, described below, with epicortical scales, which are
such an extraordinary feature that separation seems warrantable at subordinal level. The oral
apparatus is, as concerns the fine structural details, very similar to that of the Spathidiina
(FOISSNER & FOISSNER 1988, LYNN & NiCHOLLS 1985). A close relationship with spathidiids
is also indicated by the brush structure, especially the monokinetidal tail of row 3.
As yet, the suborder is monotypic. There are, however, several gymnostomatids from various
families and genera with a distinct mucilaginous layer. Reinvestigation with modern methods
might show that they are related to the trachelophyllids, but distinct at family level. Repre-
sentative examples are Enchelys vestita (KAHL, 1927b) and Ileonema simplex PENARD, 1922,
which have a distinct mucilaginous envelope composed of rod-shaped, serpentine scales (Fig.
308a-e). Very likely, they represent a new trachelophylline family. Recent observations
indicate that Enchelyotricha FOISSNER, 1987b also has a thin mucilaginous layer. Thus, this
genus, which has a highly differentiated dorsal brush, might also belong, as another new
family, to the Trachelophyllina.
Family Trachelophyllidae KENT, 1881
Improved diagnosis: Slender (> 5:1) and often highly contractile Trachelophyllina
with three-rowed dorsal brush; brush rows 1 and 2 dikinetidal, row 3 monokinetidal.
Type genus: Trachelophyllum CLAPAREDE& LACHMANN, 1859.
142

Remarks: In contrast to FoiSSNER (1984), we assign to this family only genera with
epicortical scales. Other genera are referred to a new family, -» Enchelyodontidae, diagnosed
above. The dorsal brush of the trachelophyllids is not composed of two rows, as stated by
FOISSNER (1984), GROLIERE (1977), NlCHOLLS & LYNN (1984), and SONG (1994), but of three
rows as evident from our scanning electron micrographs and refined live observation with
differential interference contrast optics. However, row 3, already clearly recognized by
BLOCHMANN (1895) and GELEI (1933), is monokinetidal and thus difficult to distinguish from
the ordinary somatic ciliary rows in silver preparations.
Here we describe and redescribe several Trachelophyllum species, whose ciliary pattern is
very similar, while the epicortical scales are highly different, suggesting separation at genus
level (Fig. 26). The epicortical scales are recognizable, albeit not easily, in all species with
phase-contrast or differential interference contrast optics and after protargol impregnation
(FOISSNER'S method). Even some of the species-specific features are discernible, provided one
knows them from the scanning electron microscope. Thus, these features are also described in
detail because they may help in light microscopic species identification. Generally, however,
light microscopy is insufficient for scale analysis, especially in new or supposedly new
species.
The epicortical scales are rather fragile and thus subject to various preparation artifacts, such
as insufficient chemical preservation and/or too high sputter energy (Fig. 309a-d). Usually,
however, the species-specific pattern is recognizable even in mediocre preparations, at least in
some specimens or at certain sites of individual specimens. Often, the scales are slightly
smaller in the oral and neck region. Rarely, they are partially or almost completely lost in
SEM-preparations, especially in a still undescribed species from South America.
TYPE1 TYPE 2 TYPE3 TYPE 4
Fig. 26. Oblique lateral and baseplate views of trachelophyllid epicortical scale types (diagrammatically after scanning
electron micrographs). Type I: Occurs in -» Trachelophyllum and -» Bilamellophrya and has a finely perforated, dish-
shaped, ellipsoidal baseplate from which a polygonally faceted, dome-shaped superstructure emerges. Type II: Occurs in ->
Bilamellophrya and has a finely perforated, broadly obconical, circular baseplate from which several arcs emerge to form a
conical, more or less distinctly faceted superstructure. Type HI: Occurs in -> Epitholiolus and has a finely perforated, flat,
ring-shaped baseplate from which few, tiny arcs emerge to form a dome-shaped superstructure. Type IV: Occurs in
Spetazoon FOISSNER, 1994c and is spherical with a finely perforated baseplate to which a widely-faceted, polygonal
superstructure is attached.
143

We shall describe the epicortical scales of two known and six new species. Two other species
have been described previously (FOISSNER 1994C, NICHOLLS & LYNN 1984). Thus, the scales
of nine species are known. Possibly, formerly most of these species would have been
classified in two or three species! However, the scales are so different that species status of
the nine populations is beyond any doubt. Indeed, only two of the populations investigated
with the scanning electron microscope have very similar scales (—> Trachelophyllum
costaricanum), indicating a high diversity of the group. Very likely, trachelophyllids are an
excellent model for exploring ciliate diversity, which is controversialy discussed (see chapter
3.1.6.1).

1984 Lepidotrachelophyllum n. g. NICHOLLS & LYNN, J. Protozool., 3: 418 (new synonym).
Improved diagnosis: Trachelophyllidae KENT, 1881 with type I scales (a polygonally
faceted, dome-shaped superstructure emerges from the flat, ellipsoidal baseplate).
Type species (subsequently designated by KENT, 1881): Trachelius apiculatus PERTY,
1852.
Remarks: Fortunately, we rediscovered and could study in detail the type species. This
showed that the genus Lepidotrachelophyllum NICHOLLS & LYNN, 1984 is a junior synonym
because it possesses the same scale type and ciliary pattern as —> T. apiculatum.
As mentioned above, the ciliary pattern and general appearance are very similar in all
trachelophyllids investigated so far; and there are many other, not yet described, similar-
looking species (—> Trachelophyllum africanum and Bilamellophrya spp.). The epicortical
scales and extrusomes, in contrast, are highly different. As both have not been studied
previously, it will never be possible to be sure about the identity of the species described in
the old literature. We can only assign them more or less arbitrarily and must neotypify the
species with the scale and extrusome data now available. This may cause problems with
article 70 of the ICZN (1999) in cases where the generic type species are concerned. If later
authors reach different conclusions, the case must be referred to the Commission.
Even if SEM scale data are available, a few "classic" features must also be studied for a
reliable species identification, viz. the nuclear apparatus (single nodule; two widely separated
nodules; two abutting nodules with a micronucleus in between) and the extrusomes (size and
shape, presence/absence), which must be investigated in live specimens because they usually
do not impregnate with protargol and/or change size and shape significantly in preparations.
In our experience, most species are definitely assignable only by their cortical scales and
extrusomes!
The taxonomic value of several other features, such as details of the dorsal brush (bristles in
parallel or V-like spread), the shape of the body and oral bulge, and the extent of body
144

contractility, is unknown. Nonetheless, they should be described because they might become
important in future.

Neotype material: Neotypified from soil of a small salt pan in the Morrocoy National
Park at the north coast of Venezuela (11°N 68°W), according to reasons 1-6 given in chapter
2.4.2. The very flat pan, which was dry when the sample was taken, was about 500 m inshore
and covered with halophytes. Soil moist, brownish, with many fine roots, highly saline, pH
7.3. The sample from the top 0-5 cm layer included surface plant litter and algal crusts and
contained 60 ciliate species, of which several were new. The second population, which was
not studied in detail because it matched the redescriptions by FOISSNER (1983b, 1984),
occurred in a soil sample from a rice field near Tsukuba, Japan.
Improved diagnosis (mainly based on Venezuelan neotype population): Size in vivo
usually 100-200 x 15-30 urn, contractile by up to 50% of body length; slenderly claviform. 2
ellipsoidal, widely distant macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. Extrusomes rod-
shaped, 10-20 urn long. Usually 10-15 ciliary rows. Epicortical scales about 1.3 x 0.8 urn
and with an average of 11 polygons in hemispherical superstructure.
Description of Venezuelan neotype population (Fig. 27a-j, 1, q, t; 310f-t):
Size of- extended specimens 130-200 x 20-30 urn in vivo; length:width ratio about 7:1, in
protargol preparations 3-9:1, on average 5.7:1 (Table 25); up to 2:1 flattened dorsoventrally.
Slenderly clavate to fusiform with neck slightly widened in oral region and gradually merging
into broadened trunk; anterior end (oral bulge) cylindroidal, posterior narrowly rounded (Fig.
27a, b, 1; 310f-i, k). Cells very flexible and contractile by up to 50% of body length,
especially in neck region; partially contracted specimens clavate (Fig. 31 Of); contracts and
extends slowly, preserved specimens thus of similar size and shape as live ones. Nuclear
apparatus in trunk. Macronuclear nodules globular to slenderly ellipsoidal (3:1), on average
1.7:1, stand out as bright blisters from granulated cytoplasm, usually distinctly apart and
connected by a fine strand, very rarely abutting or only a single nodule (in 6 out of 290
specimens analyzed); nucleoli scattered, minute, globular to elongate. Micronuclei usually
145

attached to, rarely distant from macronuclear nodules, globular to ellipsoidal (Fig. 27a, 1;
31 Oh). Contractile vacuole in rear end, a conspicuous pore in pole centre. Oral bulge
extrusomes about 10 x 0.3 urn in vivo, rod-shaped and slightly curved, do not impregnate
with protargol, become acicular just before release and up to 30 urn long when exploded (Fig.
27a, d-f; 310j); developing extrusomes usually darkly impregnated, acicular or fusiform and
7-9 urn long (Fig. 27c; 310 1). Cytoplasm and movement without peculiarities. Probably
feeds on ciliates and flagellates.
Cortex thin and flexible, contains scattered, colourless granules about 0.3 urn across and
faintly impregnated fibres (microtubule ribbons?) obliquely extending from basal bodies
anteriorly and posteriorly, forming two rather distinct bundles between each two ciliary rows;
furthermore, a short fibre (kinetodesma?) extends right-laterally from each ciliated kinetid
(Fig. 27q). Mucilaginous layer inconspicuous because very hyaline and only 1-2.5 urn thick
both in vivo and protargol preparations, produces tuberculate body surface because composed
of two to three layers of hemispherical epicortical scales (Fig. 27a, j, 1; 310 1, m, q). Scales
broadly (1.5:1) to slenderly (2.5:1) ellipsoidal, on average 1.3 x 0.8 urn, hemispherical
superstructure composed of an average of 11 widely faceted polygons; baseplate dish-shaped,
finely faceted, including dish margin, central area slightly to distinctly convex (Fig. 27t;
310k, n-p, r-t; Table 23).
Cilia in vivo 10-12 urn long, rather widely spaced, many unciliated granules (kinetids?) in
line with ciliated ones. Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, three of them
differentiated to dorsal brush rows anteriorly (Fig. 27a, h, i, 1; 310g, n; Table 25). Brush row 1
about one quarter (four dikinetids on average) shorter than row 2, composed of fairly widely
spaced dikinetids bearing acicular, V-like spread, immobile bristles about 3 urn long in vivo
and about 5 urn in protargol preparations; bristles obliquely attached to body surface and thus
entirely covered by epicortical scale layer and not recognizable in the scanning electron
microscope (Fig. 31 On). Brush row 2 like row 1. Brush row 3 extends to mid-body, composed
of monokinetids having about 3 urn long, acicular (rod-shaped in SEM micrographs),
immobile bristles projecting at right angles from body proper and piercing scale layer; thus
recognizable in scanning electron micrographs (Fig. 31 On). All brush rows continue posteri-
orly as ordinary somatic ciliary rows.
Oral bulge rather inconspicuous, about 4x4 urn, distinctly set off from body proper, in vivo
cylindrical, in protargol preparations conical in about 50% of specimens, not covered by
epicortical scales. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of about 12 rather
widely spaced dikinetids, each bearing a single cilium; gives rise to delicate fibres extending
anteriorly and to fine nematodesmata forming conical, ventricose basket (Fig. 27a, b, g, 1;
310g-i,k).
Occurrence and ecology: Trachelophyllum apiculatum has been recorded from soils
world-wide (FoiSSNER 1998a) and from many freshwater and brackish habitats (FoiSSNER et
al. 1995). However, many records and autecological data, which were comprehensively
reviewed by FOISSNER et al. (1995), are possibly based on misidentifications, as explained in
the genus discussion above. However, the species is likely the most frequent one of the genus,
according to our experience; but the varying thickness and distinctiveness of the epicortical
scale layer indicate that it might be a species complex.

Identification: The Venezuelan population largely corresponds to T. apiculatum as
redescribed by BLOCHMANN (1895; Fig. 27s), PENARD (1922; Fig. 27u, v), KAHL (1926; Fig.
27n-p), DRAGESCO (1966), CZAPIK & JORDAN (1976a), FOISSNER (1983b, 1984; Fig. 27k, w,
x), and SONG (1994; Fig. 27y). It is also similar to the synonym proposed by KAHL (1930a),
viz., Trachelophyllum tachyblastum STOKES, 1884 (Fig. 27m), and to the original description
(Fig. 27r), which is, however, too incomplete for a definite identification3. On the other hand,
considerable differences are evident between some of the populations listed in table 24,
indicating confusion of at least two species (one with about 10—15 and another with about 15-
25 ciliary rows). Furthermore, the shape of the oral bulge and the distinctiveness of the
mucilaginous layer seem to be different in some populations. However, the mucilaginous
layer is very hyaline in this species and hardly recognizable without interference contrast
optics, and the bulge shape is fragile in general. Accordingly, these features must not be over-
interpreted and are of hardly any use for a subsequent assignment of populations. In this
situation, improved characterization by the epicortical scales and neotypification are the only
way to bring some order to the chaos.

Trachelophyllum africanum nov. spec. (Fig. 28a-n; 31 la-m; Table 25)
Diagnosis: Size about 200 x 25 urn in vivo, contractile by up to 50% of body length;
slenderly claviform. 2 ellipsoidal, widely distant macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus
each. Extrusomes narrowly lanceolate, about 3.5 urn long. On average 13 ciliary rows.
Epicortical scales of a Venezuelan population about 1 x 0.6 urn and with an average of 12
polygons in hemispherical superstructure.
Type location: Soil from margin of Sirkelsvlei, a small lake in the centre of the Cape of
Good Hope Nature Reserve, Republic of South Africa, 34°15'S 18°25'E.
Etymology: Named after the continent discovered.
Description: Three likely conspecific populations were studied. However, the diagnosis
contains only the population from the Republic of South Africa, except for the fine structure
151

of the epicortical scales.
Extended specimens 150-250 x 20-30 urn in vivo; length:width ratio about 8:1, in protargol
preparations 6:1-14:1, on average 7.5:1 (Table 25); slightly to up to 2:1 flattened
dorsoventrally. Slenderly clavate with neck slightly widened in oral region and gradually
merging into broadened trunk, anterior end (oral bulge) cylindroidal, posterior rounded (Fig.
28a-c; 311a). Cells very flexible and contractile by up to 50% of body length, showing
Euglena-Mke convulsions under slight cover glass pressure; contracts and extends slowly,
preserved specimens thus of similar size and shape as live ones. Nuclear apparatus in trunk,
of 30 specimens analyzed, 27 had two macronuclear nodules, 2 had three, and 1 possessed
only a single nodule. Macronuclear nodules ellipsoidal (2:1) to elongate ellipsoidal (3:1), on
average 2.7:1, stand out as bright blisters from granulated cytoplasm, usually distinctly apart
and connected by a fine strand. Micronuclei usually attached to macronuclear nodules,
ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal. Contractile vacuole in posterior end, with conspicuous pore
in pole centre. Oral bulge extrusomes sparse, that is, bulge contains 2-5 organelles only,
narrowly lanceolate and 3-4 urn long in vivo and protargol preparations, distinctly clavate
and 8-10 urn long when exploded (Fig. 28a-e, h, i; 311b, c). Cytoplasm and movement
without peculiarities. Feeds on resting cysts of Vorticella and very likely also on medium-
sized active ciliates and flagellates.
Cortex thin and flexible, contains scattered, colourless granules and a fibre system as
described in -» T. apiculatum. Mucilaginous layer very hyaline and 2-3 urn thick in vivo,
produces tuberculate body surface because composed of hemispherical scales, whose faceted
superstructure causes minute, granular condensations on surface of scale layer (Fig. 28a, b, e,
g; 31 Id); becomes more distinct in almost desiccated specimens (Fig. 31 If). Epicortical
scales of a Venezuelan population 0.8-1.6 x 0.5-0.8 urn in size and with 7—21 polygons in
hemispherical superstructure (Fig. 31 lg-m).
Cilia about 12 urn long in vivo, rather widely spaced, many unciliated granules (kinetids?) in
line with ciliated ones. Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, three of them
differentiated to dorsal brush rows anteriorly (Fig. 28a, b, e, f; 31 la, c). Brush row 1 about a
quarter (six dikinetids on average) shorter than row 2, composed of widely spaced dikinetids
bearing acicular, V-like spread bristles; anterior bristle about 1 urn long, posterior about 4
urn. Brush row 2 similar to row 1, anterior bristle of dikinetids about 2.5 urn long, posterior
about 6 urn. Brush row 3 extends to mid-body, composed of monokinetids having about 3 urn
long bristles projecting at right angles from body proper. All brush rows continue posteriorly
as ordinary somatic ciliary rows.
Oral bulge in vivo cylindroidal, about 4x4 urn, very fragile becoming conical at even the
slightest cover glass pressure (Fig. 28h, i) and in preserved specimens (Fig. 311b).
Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of about 12 rather widely spaced
dikinetids each bearing a single cilium; give rise to delicate fibres extending anteriorly and to
fine nematodesmata forming conical, ventricose basket (Fig. 28c, e, h, i; 31 lb, c).
Observations from other populations: A similar population occurred at
Namibian site 30 (Fig. 28j-n; 31 le, f; Table 25). It matches T. africanum in habitat and most
morphological and morphometrical features, except for the following details: size (about 150
x 16 urn vs. 200 x 25 urn in vivo), dorsal brush (rows 1 and 2 of same length vs. row 1
slightly longer than row 2), and shape and size of the extrusomes (rod-shaped and only about
1 urn long vs. elongate lanceolate and 3.5 urn long). These inconspicuous differences indicate

conspecificity, which is supported by the epicortical scale layer, which appears very similar in
the light microscope. On the other hand, the differences in the extrusomes, which occurred
also in the population from the Hluhluwe Game Reserve, South Africa, might justify
subspecies rank. However, in the absence of detailed scale data, we prefer to lump all
populations in a single species, T. africanum.
Very recently, we found a population with extrusomes like the Namibian site (30) specimens
in Venezuela, South America, about 200 km north of Puerto Ayacucho. The epicortical scales
form two layers and are very similar to those of T. apiculatum (Fig. 31 lg-m; Table 25).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, that is, in soil from the
margin of a small lake, and possibly at Namibian site (30), which is a similar biotope. The
type location is covered with grass and small sedges and very likely flooded during wet
periods. The soil is sandy, wet, and contains many fine roots, pH 5.4. The sample, taken from
the top 5 cm on 18.02.1995, contained about 50 ciliate species, including two new genera and
four new species. Other populations were observed in soil from a forest in the Hluhluwe
Game Reserve (picnic site at crocodile pool), South Africa, and in Venezuela, as mentioned
above.
Comparison with related species and generic classification: The
general appearance of T. africanum is very similar to members of the —> T. apiculatum group.
The extrusomes, in contrast, are almost unique by their small size and lanceolate shape. Such
extrusomes occur only in one other species, namely -» Bilamellophrya etoschensis. This
species is similar to T. africanum also in many other respects, especially when the population
from the Galapagos Islands is included in the variation range. Thus, these two species are
easily confused. Nonetheless, the light microscopical appearance of the mucilaginous (scale)
layer is different, indicating that they belong to different genera: tuberculate by dome-shaped
type I scales in T. africanum (Fig. 28g; 31 Id, f), serrate by conical type II scales in —» B.
etoschensis. Furthermore, the extrusomes are different: narrowly lanceolate and protargol-
affine in T. africanum (Fig. 28d, h, i; 311b, e), while rod-shaped and unstained in -> B.
etoschensis (Fig. 34b, d; 316c). The different generic classification of T. africanum and —> B.
etoschensis is sustained by the SEM investigation of the Venezuelan population, showing that
this type of trachelophyllids belongs to Trachelophyllum (Fig. 31 lg-m).
Trachelophyllum pannonicum nov. spec. (Fig. 29a-j; 312a—j; Table 26)
Diagnosis: Size about 200 x 20 urn in vivo, slightly contractile; slenderly fusiform. 2
ellipsoidal, widely distant macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. Two types of
extrusomes: type I acicular and 9 urn long; type II rod-shaped, inconspicuous because fine
and only 2 urn long. On average 11 ciliary rows. Epicortical scales about 1.5 x 1 urn and with
an average of 46 polygons in hemispherical superstructure.
Type location: Saline grassland soil from margin of the Neusiedlersee, a soda lake in the
"hell" region near Illmitz, Burgenland, Austria, 47°45'N 16°48'E.
155

Etymology: Adjective of Pannonia (Latin), that is, the region at the Austrian-Hungarian
borderline, where the species was discovered.
Description: All observations are from specimens grown in a raw culture set up with
some ml soil percolate containing the indigenous organism community, Eau de Volvic
(French table water), and two crushed wheat grains to stimulate growth of food organisms
(bacteria, flagellates, small ciliates). Trachelophyllum pannonicum and some other ciliates
grew well in this culture for some time.
Size of extended specimens 140-250 x 18-25 urn in vivo, usually about 200 x 20 um (width
without mucilaginous layer), length:width ratio about 10:1, in protargol preparations 7-14:1,
on average 9.5:1 (Table 26); flattened up to 2:1 dorsoventrally, depending on nutrition.
Slenderly fusiform to clavate with neck slightly widened in oral region and gradually merging
into broadened trunk, anterior end (oral bulge) cylindroidal, posterior invariably narrowed to
short, sharp tip, occasionally forming indistinct tail in protargol preparations (Fig. 29a-c, f;
312e). Cells very flexible but only slightly (< 30%) contractile, mainly in neck region,
preserved specimens thus of similar size and shape as live ones (Fig. 312e, f). Nuclear
apparatus in trunk. Macronuclear nodules globular to slenderly ellipsoidal (3:1), on average
2:1, stand out as bright blisters from granulated cytoplasm, usually distinctly apart and
connected by a fine strand, very rarely almost abutting; of 90 specimens analyzed, 5 had only
one macronuclear nodule, 80 had two nodules, 4 had three and 1 even four nodules; nucleoli
numerous, minute, irregularly globular. Micronuclei usually attached or near to, rarely distant
from macronuclear nodules, globular to slightly ellipsoidal. Contractile vacuole in posterior
end, obconical, no excretory pore could be found, not even in many excellently or over-
impregnated specimens. Two types of extrusomes, which impregnate with silver carbonate
but not with protargol, in oral bulge and cytoplasm (Fig. 29a, d, e; 312a, b): type I
conspicuous because 8-10 x 0.5 urn, that is, composed of a thick, cylindroidal proximal half
and a thin, slightly curved, distally nippled rod, does not form bundles in cytoplasm; type II
rod-shaped and inconspicuous because very fine (< 0.3 urn) and only about 2 urn long,
mainly attached to bulge surface. Cytoplasm colourless often containing several food
vacuoles with Halteria grandinella and many globular and irregular fat inclusions 1-10 urn
across. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide and swims by rotation about main body axis.
Cortex thin and flexible, contains fibres as described in -» T. apiculatum after protargol
impregnation. Furthermore, three argyrophilic structures (fibres?) are associated with each
kinetid after silver carbonate impregnation (Fig. 312a): (i) an about 3 urn long (kinetodesmal
fibre?) structure extending obliquely anteriad at the right side of the basal body, (ii) an about
1 urn long structure extending obliquely anteriad at the left side of the kinetid, and (iii) an
about 2 urn long structure extending posteriorly. Mucilaginous layer much more
inconspicuous and thinner in vivo (1-2 urn) than in protargol preparations (2-3 urn), where
the epicortical scales appear globular or hemispherical, producing a tuberculate body surface
(Fig. 29a, d, f-h; 312c-f). Epicortical scales stacked in two to three layers on body surface,
highly variable in size and number of polygons composing superstructure, those near oral
bulge usually distinctly smaller than those on rest of cell. Individual scales circular to
elliptical (2:1), on average 1.5 x 1 urn, hemispherical superstructure composed of 46
polygons on average, those abutting on baseplate usually distinctly larger than those in central
area, which form a rather regular, honey-comb pattern; baseplate dish-shaped, finely faceted,
including dish margin, central area slightly to distinctly convex (Fig. 29i, j; 312g-j).

a Data based, if not otherwise stated, on mounted, protargol-impregnated (FOlSSNER's method), and randomly
selected specimens from a pure culture (T. pannonicum) or a non-flooded Petri dish culture (T. costaricanum).
Measurements in urn. CV - coefficient of variation in %, M - median, Max - maximum, Min - minimum, n -
number of individuals investigated, SD - standard deviation, SE - standard error of arithmetic mean, X -

b Without mucilaginous (scale) layer.
c From specimens with two macronuclear nodules.
d Of 90 T. pannonicum specimens analyzed, 5 have one macronuclear nodule, 80 have two nodules, 4 have
three and 1 has four nodules.
c Ciliated and unciliated kinetids were counted.
f Row 3 is monokinetidal (see description).
8 From SEM micrographs. The small scales near the oral bulge of T. pannonicum were excluded.
Cilia about 12 um long in vivo, rather widely spaced, some unciliated granules (kinetids?) in
line with ciliated ones. Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, three (rarely
four) of them differentiated to dorsal brush rows anteriorly (Fig. 29a, f-h; Table 26). Brush
row 1 about half as long as row 2, composed of fairly widely spaced dikinetids bearing about
4 urn long, parallel bristles (not spread V-like as in some other species) obliquely attached to
body surface and thus usually not recognizable in the scanning electron microscope because
covered by the epicortical scale layer. Brush row 2 like row 1, bristles, however, only about 3
urn long. Brush row 3 extends to near posterior body end, composed of monokinetids having
about 4 um long, immobile bristles projecting at right angles from body proper and piercing
scale layer. Brush rows 1 and 2 continue posteriorly as ordinary somatic kineties.
Oral bulge rather conspicuous because distinctly set off from body proper and refractive due
to the extrusomes contained; cylindrical, rarely bluntly conical, 3- 5 urn high and 3—4 urn
across, not covered by epicortical scales, bulge surface flat and smooth in the scanning
electron microscope. Circumoral kinety composed of about 10 rather widely spaced dikinetids
each bearing a single cilium; gives rise to delicate fibres extending anteriorly, as in —»
Epitholiolus chilensis, and to fine nematodesmata forming an inconspicuous, slightly conical
oral basket (Fig. 29a-d, f-h; 312e).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, that is, in a rather
saline, dark brown grassland soil with pH 7.9.
Comparison with related species: The epicortical scales of T. pannonicum are
unique in having a high number and specific arrangement of polygons in the hemispherical
superstructure (Fig. 29i, j; 312g-j). Thus, species status is beyond reasonable doubt.
However, all other main features of T. pannonicum, such as body size and shape, nuclear
apparatus, number of ciliary rows, and shape and size of the extrusomes, are highly similar to
those of —> T. costaricanum and —» Bilamellophtya hawaiiensis. Indeed, these species are
159

hardly separable by conventional features, although they differ slightly in some details, such
as the shape of the micronucleus (globular in T. pannonicum, ellipsoidal in -»• T.
costaricanum and —> B. hawaiiensis) and the extrusomes (all belong, however, to the acicular
type), the excretory pore of the contractile vacuole (distinct only in -> B. hawaiiensis), and
several morphometric features (length ratio of brush rows 1 and 2). However, the taxonomic
value of these sophisticated features is doubtful because of the lack of data on variability
among populations. Accordingly, unequivocal identification of T. pannonicum, -» T.
costaricanum, and —> B. hawaiiensis requires scanning electron microscopy of the epicortical
scales.
Trachelophyllum costaricanum nov. spec. (Fig. 30a-v; 313a-m; Table 26)
Diagnosis: Size about 180 x 15 urn in vivo, slightly contractile; slenderly fusiform. 2
ellipsoidal, widely distant macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. Two types of
extrusomes: type I acicular to obclavate and 12 urn long; type II rod-shaped, inconspicuous
because fine and only 2 urn long. On average 9 ciliary rows. Epicortical scales about 1.3 x 0.9
urn and with an average of 13 rather regularly arranged hexagons in truncate cone-shaped
superstructure.
Type location: Soil from coastal swamp near Punta Codes, Caribbean coast of Costa
Rica, Central America, 09°40'N 82°40'W.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size of extended specimens 140-220 x 13-20 urn in vivo, usually about
180 x 15 urn (width without mucilaginous layer); length:width ratio in vivo about 12:1, in
protargol preparations 7-17:1, on average 11:1 (Table 26); flattened up to 2:1 dorsoventrally,
depending on nutrition state. Slenderly fusiform to clavate with neck slightly widened in oral
region and gradually merging into broadened trunk, anterior (oral) region cylindroidal,
posterior narrowed and bluntly pointed (Fig. 30a, g, i, j, m). Cells very flexible, but only
about 30% of body length contractile, mainly in neck region (Fig. 30g, h), preserved
specimens thus of similar size and shape as live ones. Nuclear apparatus in middle third of
cell, micronuclei lacking or not impregnated in about half of specimens. Macronuclear
nodules globular to ellipsoidal (2:1), on average 1.5:1, stand out as bright blisters from
granulated cytoplasm, usually distinctly apart and connected by a fine strand in about 70% of
specimens; nucleoli globular and of usual size. Micronuclei attached to or rather distant from
macronuclear nodules, broadly ellipsoidal (Fig. 30a, j, m; 313a). Contractile vacuole
subterminal, globular, no excretory pore could be found, not even in excellently or over-
impregnated specimens. Two types of extrusomes in oral bulge and cytoplasm (Fig. 30a, b, d-
f; 313b, c). Type I extrusomes conspicuous because about 12 x 1.2 urn and acicular to
obclavate, does not form bundles in cytoplasm, those attached to oral bulge do not impregnate
with protargol, while those in the cytoplasm stain lightly and have various shapes, possibly
representing developmental stages (Fig. 30o); when exploding, the thinner, distal half
elongates to an up to 40 urn long thread, and some toxin droplets remain in the proximal half
(Fig. 30d; 313c). Type II extrusomes rod-shaped and inconspicuous because fine (< 0.3 urn
across) and only about 2 urn long, do not impregnate with protargol. Cytoplasm colourless,
160

contains some fat globules up to 3 urn across and food vacuoles with various protozoans,
mainly medium-sized ciliates, such as Gonostomum affine and Vorticella astyliformis; prey is
ingested whole, often deforming the predator and dislocating the nuclear apparatus (Fig. 30a,
m; 313a). Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide.
Cortex about 1 urn thick and very flexible, contains scattered, colourless granules about 0.5
jxm across and a faintly impregnated fibre system very similar to that described in -» T.
apiculatum; however, fibre extending anteriorly at left side of kinetids shorter than in —> T.
apiculatum and thus not bundled with fibres from more anteriorly located kinetids (Fig. 30b,
c). Mucilaginous layer about 3 urn thick in vivo, but very hyaline and thus difficult to
recognize, composed of 1-2 layers of rather loosely adhering epicortical scales (Fig. 30a, b;
313a, d, e, h). Individual scales in vivo about 2 urn across, in protargol preparations
approximately 1.5 urn, and in scanning electron micrographs only about 1 urn, indicating
strong shrinkage due to the preparation procedures (Table 26). Size and structure of scales
rather constant, baseplate broadly ellipsoidal, superstructure uniquely forms truncate cone
producing pentagonal outline of scales in side view, recognizable even in protargol
preparations (Fig. 30p-v; 313d—1; Table 26). Superstructure composed of an average of 13
rather regularly arranged hexagons separated by broad bridges, that is, a ring of elongated
hexagons extends anteriorly from the margin of the baseplate and abuts on one or two rows of
ordinary hexagons in the slightly convex central area of the distal, truncate cone surface.
Baseplate dish-shaped, finely faceted, including dish margin, central area slightly to distinctly
convex (Fig. 30q; 313f, g, m).
Cilia in vivo about 12 urn long and rather widely spaced because irregularly alternating with
slightly smaller, bare basal bodies (Fig. 30c). Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly
arranged, three of them differentiated to dorsal brush rows anteriorly (Fig. 30a, b, j, k, n;
Table 26). Brush row 1 on average slightly less than half as long as row 2, composed of fairly
widely spaced dikinetids bearing about 4 urn long, parallel bristles (not spread V-like as in
some other species) obliquely attached to body surface and thus usually not recognizable in
the scanning electron microscope because covered by the epicortical scale layer (Fig. 313d).
Brush row 2 like row 1, bristles, however, about 5 urn long. Brush row 3 extends to posterior
body end, composed of monokinetids having about 5 urn long, immobile bristles projecting at
right angles from body proper and thus piercing scale layer (Fig. 313d). Brush rows 1 and 2
continue posteriorly as ordinary somatic ciliary rows.
Oral bulge rather conspicuous because distinctly set off from body proper and refractive due
to the extrusomes contained; cylindroidal to indistinctly conical, about 4 urn high and 3 urn
wide in vivo, not covered by epicortical scales. Circumoral kinety composed of about 12
rather widely spaced dikinetids each bearing a single cilium; gives rise to delicate fibres
extending anteriorly, as in —> Epitholiolus chilensis, and to fine nematodesmata forming an
inconspicuous oral basket (Fig. 30a, b, j-1; 313d). Interestingly, the oral basket of T.
costaricanum appears in two forms: slightly conical, as in all other species described (Fig.
30k), and obconical (funnel-shaped; Fig. 301). We could not clarify the reason.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location (dark swamp soil from
coastal rain forest about 20 m inshore of the Caribbean Sea coast; pH 6.0) and, probably (see
below), in a paddy field from Japan. Two other populations were found in soils from the
Republic of South Africa. However, identification is doubtful because entirely based on live
observations, mainly shape and size of the body and extrusomes.

163

Comparison with related species: The epicortical scales of T. costaricanum are
rather similar to those of —> T. apiculatum (Fig. 313n-q); uniquely, the superstructure is
truncate cone-shaped, providing the scales with a highly characteristic pentagonal outline in
side view (Fig. 30p, q; 313f-h). Similar scales were observed in a Japanese Trachelophyllum
(Fig. 313n-p), which, unfortunately, was insufficiently studied in vivo. Thus, conspecificity is
uncertain. The scales of the Japanese population have thinner bridges between the facets and
usually possess a circular field of small hexagons in the centre of the superstructure. While
the thickness of the bridges may vary with preparation conditions, the pentagonal (rarely
hexagonal) shape of the basal facets and the circular field of hexagons in the centre of the
superstructure indicate that it is a different species.
The unique shape of the epicortical scales defines T. costaricanum as a distinct species. All
other main features highly resemble those of —> T. pannonicum and —> Bilamellophrya
hawaiiensis. See T. pannonicum for detailed discussion.
Epitholiolus nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Trachelophyllidae KENT, 1881 with type III scales (some tiny arcs, which
form a dome-shaped superstructure, emerge from a ring-shaped baseplate).
Type species: Lacrimaria chilensis BÜRGER, 1906.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek preposition epi (upon), the Latin plural noun tholi
(domes, cupolae), and the Latin diminutive suffix olus, referring to the minute domes
covering the cell. Masculine gender.
Comparison with related genera and species assignable: KAHL (1930a)
transferred Lacrymaria chilensis BÜRGER, 1906 to Trachelophyllum, recognizing the
similarities with that genus. This is supported by our investigations, which show that the
ciliary pattern of L. chilensis is very similar to classic members of the genus Trachelophyllum
CLAPAREDE & LACHMANN, 1859, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1984) and SONG (1994). Here,
the species is referred to a new genus, Epitholiolus, which differs from the other genera of the
family not only by the unique structure of the epicortical scales (see introduction to family),
but also by the nuclear apparatus (abutting vs. widely distant macronuclear nodules) and the
mode of conjugation (by lateral fusion [Fig. 31g] vs. polar fusion [KAHL 1930a]). Whether
these features are of generic significance needs further investigation.
We assign to Epitholiolus also Trachelophyllum attenuatum FOISSNER, 1983b because it has,
like —> E. chilensis, an inconspicuous mucilaginous (scale) layer and two abutting
macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus in between (Fig. 31p, q): Epitholiolus attenuatus
(FOISSNER, 1983) nov. comb. Epitholiolus attenuatus, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1984),
differs from —» E. chilensis in body shape (ellipsoidal vs. slenderly claviform; Fig. 31a, p)
and number of ciliary rows (14 vs. 9 on average). Furthermore, E. attenuatus has rod-shaped
extrusomes (FOISSNER 1983b, 1984). However, in protargol-impregnated specimens they may
be acicular like those of —> E. chilensis. We checked the original notes on E. attenuatus. The
extrusomes were measured and drawn, but their exact shape was not definitely stated. Thus,
they might be acicular as in —» E. chilensis.

1930 Trachelophyllum (Lacrymarid) chilense BÜRGER, 1906 — KAHL, Tierwelt Dtl., 18:115.
Neotype material: Neotypified from Namibian site (26) population, according to
reasons 1, 2, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 95x10 jam in vivo, contractile by up to 40% of body
length; slenderly claviform to almost cylindrical. Micronucleus usually in corners formed by
two abutting, globular macronuclear nodules. Two types of extrusomes: type I acicular and 9
urn long; type II flask-shaped and 2 (am long. On average 9 ciliary rows. Epicortical scales
about 0.6 urn across and with an average of 4 arcs forming hemispherical superstructure.
Description of Namibian neotype population: Size of extended specimens
70-130 x 9-11 urn in vivo; unflattened. Slenderly clavate, fusiform or cylindroidal,
length:width ratio in vivo 7-13:1, after protargol impregnation about 8:1 (Table 27). Anterior
end narrowly cylindrical and refractive due to the extrusomes contained, posterior narrowly
rounded to slightly tapered (Fig. 31a, k-m; 314a, e, k-m). Cells very flexible and contractile
by up to 40% of body length, fully contracted specimens about 65 x 20 urn and rather broadly
claviform, highly resembling ordinary specimens of E. attenuatus (cp. Fig. 31k-p; 314r);
contracts and extends slowly, preserved specimens thus of almost same length as live ones.
Nuclear apparatus in centre of cell on average, occasionally however, considerably anterior or
posterior of mid-body, consists of one to two, usually two macronuclear nodules and one to
two, usually one micronucleus often difficult to distinguish from similarly sized and
impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Macronuclear nodules globular to slightly ellipsoidal, in
vivo 6-8 jxm across, stand out as bright blisters from granulated cytoplasm, usually tightly
abutting; nucleoli minute and globular. Micronucleus usually in corners formed by abutting
macronuclear nodules, rarely in between or attached to other sites of nodules, disc-shaped and
slightly ellipsoidal (Fig. 31a, k, m, s; 314a-c, f, g, k-m); rarely up to 7 urn across and
reticular (Fig. 31c). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, with single excretory pore
about 2.5 urn across. Two types of extrusomes, both heavily impregnated by silver carbonate,
in oral dome and cytoplasm (Fig. 31a, b; 314d, g, i, j, 1, n): type I conspicuous because 8-10 x
0.8 urn and highly refractive, acicular and slightly curved, those developing in cytoplasm
slightly shorter (6-8 urn) and occasionally impregnated by protargol (Fig. 3Id, s; 314 1, n);
type II inconspicuous because only 2 x 0.5 urn, mainly in oral region, flask-shaped, especially
after silver carbonate impregnation, does not stain with protargol. Cytoplasm colourless,
contains many globular and irregular fat inclusions 1-6 urn across and some 3-4 um-sized
food vacuoles with remnants of ciliates, mainly Protocyclidium muscicola. Glides slowly on
microscope slide and serpentinely between organic debris.
Cortex thin and flexible, contains minute (about 0.2 urn), colourless granules forming
posteriorly broadening stripes within ciliary rows (Fig. 31j; 314h); covered with an about 0.4
urn thick, mucilaginous layer of epicortical scales producing tuberculate body surface both in
vivo and protargol preparations (Fig. 31a, v; 314p). Scales tightly spaced and 0.6 urn across
165

on average in scanning electron micrographs, form single layer on entire body, except for oral
dome, recognizable in vivo only with interference contrast optics and, after protargol
impregnation, only in over-stained specimens. Scale baseplate ring-shaped with an average of
14 minute perforations, gives rise to three to four, usually four convex arcs about as high as
baseplate radius, forming minute dome with one, occasionally two tiny perforations on top
(Fig. 31x-z; 314q-u; Table 27).
Cilia in vivo only about 6 urn long, rather widely spaced, cylindrical with conical distal end.
Kinetodesmal fibres conspicuous after silver carbonate impregnation and directed obliquely
anteriorly (Fig. 314d). Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, three of them
differentiated to dorsal brush rows anteriorly (Fig. 31a, r-w; 314a, k-n, r, v-y; Table 27).
Brush row 1 about half as long as rows 2 and 3, composed of closely spaced dikinetids having
about 4 urn long, rod-shaped bristles directed obliquely anteriorly. Brush row 2 similar to row
1, but with posterior cilium of dikinetids shortened to 2-3 urn long stumps in rear third of
row. Brush row 3 slightly longer than row 2, composed of rather closely spaced monokinetids
having about 1 urn long, slightly tongue-shaped ciliary stumps projecting at right angles from
body proper. All brush rows continue posteriorly as ordinary somatic kineties.
Oral bulge minute, cylindroidal, in vivo 3—4 urn across and 2-3 urn high, distinctly set off
from body proper, brilliant because containing anterior end of extrusomes. Bulge surface flat
to convex, smooth, that is, without central depression and/or opening (Fig. 314y). Circumoral
kinety at base of oral bulge, dikinetidal, only one basal body of dikinetids bears an about 6
urn long cilium (Fig. 31a, b, r-u; 314b, e, k-o, r, v-y). Pharyngeal basket recognizable neither
in vivo nor in protargol preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: BÜRGER (1906) discovered E. chilensis in an irrigation
ditch; it flourished when the sample became putrid. We found E. chilensis at site (26), that is,
in the litter-sand mixture from a dune of the Namib Desert. This sample contained much
organic debris, and a rich and diverse ciliate community developed a few days after rewetting.
Certainly, rewetting produced some kind of polysaprobic milieu, which this species seems to
prefer, although it occurs also in only slightly polluted, mesosaprobic environments (see
below). Epitholiolus chilensis has never been recorded from terrestrial habitats, but is
common in stagnant and running waters world-wide. The following compilation is not
complete but representative: Chile (BÜRGER 1906); potable water from Mexico (MADRAZO-
GARIBAY & LÖPEZ-OCHOTERENA 1982); common in clean and polluted sections of the South
River, Virginia, USA (CAIRNS & DiCKSON 1972); common in eutrophic ponds and reservoirs
and mesosaprobic and polysaprobic rivers of Czechoslovakia (MATIS 1977, MATIS &
TIRJAKOVA 1994, MATIS et al. 1996, SRÄMEK-HUSEK 1946, TIRJAKOVÄ 1993), Moldavia
(ViCOL & CiORJC 1994), and Russia (OLEKSIV 1985); polluted stagnant and running waters in
China (MA ZHENXUE 1994, SHEN et al. 1995, YANG HAIMING 1989).
Comparison with original description: Lacrymaria chilensis has not been
restudied since the original description. Only SRÄMEK-HUSEK (1946) provided a few
schematic figures from a population of a heavily polluted (polysaprobic) river in
Czechoslovakia. The identification was likely correct, although the specimens were
considerably smaller (35-60 urn) than those from the Chilean type population (80-100 urn).
Our specimens from a sand dune in the Namib Desert matched the original data perfectly,
except for the elongated and condensed cilia in the oral region (Fig. 31a, e-i; 314b). However,
BÜRGER (1906) was possibly influenced in this respect by the genus Lacrymaria, to which he

assigned his species, which possesses such a condensation. Furthermore, BÜRGER (1906)
obviously did not observe such details carefully, otherwise he would have noted the rather
conspicuous dorsal brush (possibly he saw brush row 3; Fig. 3If). Thus, identification is
beyond reasonable doubt and neotypification justified.
Epitholiolus chilensis and E. attenuatum, as combined above, are easily distinguished from
other trachelophyllids by the abutting macronuclear nodules (vs. widely separated). Be
careful not to confuse Epitholiolus spp. with —> Apoenchelys bamforthi, which has a similar
size, shape, and nuclear pattern.

Bilamellophrya nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Trachelophyllidae KENT, 1881 with type I and type II epicortical scales. Type
I scales attached to pellicle, composed of a finely perforated, dish-shaped, ellipsoidal
baseplate from which a widely and polygonally faceted, dome-shaped superstructure emerges.
Type II scales upon type I scales, biconical, composed of a finely perforated, dish-shaped,
broadly turbinate, circular baseplate from which fine, concave arcs emerge to form a conical
superstructure.
Type species: Bilamellophrya australiensisnov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin words bi (two) and lamella (thin plate) and the Greek
noun ophrya (eyebrow ~ cilia ~ ciliate s. 1.), meaning "a ciliate having two types of platelets".
Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera: Bilamellophrya is unique in having two kinds
of epicortical scales, of which type II is unparalleled. Thus, at least generic separation seems
appropriate. Possibly, further studies will reveal that such taxa belong to a distinct family.
Three new species will be described from Gondwanan soils. However, FoiSSNER et al. (1994)
published a few scanning electron micrographs of a "Lepidotrachelophyllum sp." from a river
in Germany. It differs from —> B. australiensis mainly by the type II scales, whose conical
superstructure is not curtain-like but polygonal. Detailed data are lacking from the German
population, but the observations show that trachelophyllids with two scale types are not
restricted to Gondwanan areas.
Bilamellophrya australiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 32a-v, 33a-g; 315a-s; Table 28)
Diagnosis: Size about 200 x 30 urn in vivo, highly contractile; slenderly claviform. 2
ellipsoidal, widely distant macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. Two types of rod-
shaped extrusomes: type I slightly curved, 15-25 urn long; type II only 2 urn long. On
average 24 ciliary rows. Type I scales on average 1.6 x 1 |im and with 8 polygons in
superstructure; type II scales about 2 urn across and high, conical superstructure composed of
an average of 10 meridional arcs and 2 transverse rings.
Type location: Soil from Murray River floodplain near the town of Albury at the
landside of Ryans road, Australia, 37°S 147°E.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description (including data from a second Australian population, see discussion): Size of
extended specimens 150-250 x 25-40 urn in vivo, length:width ratio about 6-8:1, on average
4-7:1 in protargol preparations (Table 28). Slenderly clavate to fusiform with neck slightly
widened in oral region and gradually merging into broadened trunk; slightly to distinctly
flattened dorsoventrally. Anterior end button-shaped and refractive due to the extrusomes
170

contained, posterior end narrowly rounded to slightly tapered (Fig. 32a, e). Cells very flexible
and contractile by up to 50% of body length, especially in neck region, fully contracted
specimens fusiform (Fig. 32b; 315a); contracts and extends slowly, preserved specimens thus
of similar size and shape as live ones. Nuclear apparatus in middle third of cell. Macronuclear
nodules broadly ellipsoidal, stand out as bright blisters from granulated cytoplasm, usually
distinctly apart and never connected by a fine strand, very rarely abutting as in —>• Epitholio-
lus chilensis, occasionally small specimens with only one nodule; nucleoli scattered, globular,
minute (0.2-2 urn). Micronuclei usually attached to macronuclear nodules, conspicuously
large and fusiform (Fig. 32a, u, 33b; 315b; Table 28). Contractile vacuole in posterior end,
with single, about 3 urn long, posterolateral excretory pore. Two size-types of basically rod-
shaped extrusomes (Fig. 32a, c, i, 1, m, 33c; 315b), the large type originates in conspicuous
blisters and is acicular and protargol-affine during development (Fig. 32j, k). Type I extru-
somes conspicuous because 15-20 x 0.5 (im (20-25 um in second population), rod-shaped
and slightly curved, form highly refractive bundles in oral bulge and cytoplasm, do not
impregnate with protargol, except for proximal, toxin-containing portion; become acicular,
very hyaline, and up to 60 um long when exploded. Type II extrusomes inconspicuous
because only about 2 urn long, mainly in oral bulge, do not impregnate with protargol.
Cytoplasm colourless and rather hyaline, contains fat globules 5-10 urn across and many
ring-shaped granules (similar to those found in certain Plagiocampa and Dexiotricha species)
about 1 urn across. Likely feeds on small ciliates. Glides rapidly on microscope slide and
serpentinely between debris, often almost immobile for some time, slowly contracting and
extending.
Cortex thin and flexible, contains scattered, colourless granules about 0.3 urn across (Fig.
32h); covered with an up to 5 urn thick, mucilaginous layer of epicortical scales producing
serrate body margin both in vivo and protargol preparations (Fig. 32a, c, g, u, 33b; 315a, b, e,
f). Mucilaginous layer composed of two kinds of scales lying one upon the other (Fig. 32a, g,
33d-g; 315g-s; Table 28). Type I scales in one to two layers on body surface, except for oral
bulge, tightly spaced, 1.6 x 1 urn on average and thus hardly recognizable in the light
microscope, domed superstructure with 8 polygons on average. Type II scales complicated
and beautiful, upon and more loosely arranged than type I scales, about 2 urn across and 2 urn
high and thus well-recognizable in the light microscope, baseplate broadly obconical and
often somewhat undulated, gives rise to an average of 10 concave arcs forming conspicuous
cone producing serrate body margin described above; arcs rather unevenly spaced and
connected by two transverse rings.
Cilia 15-20 urn (!) long in vivo, rather widely spaced, only that portion of each cilium which
extends beyond the mucilaginous layer vibrates. Postciliary microtubule ribbons distinct,
form conspicuous fibre between kineties. Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly
arranged, three of them differentiated to dorsal brush rows anteriorly (Fig. 32a, c, f, u, Fig.
33b; 315a, c, p, q; Table 28). Brush row 1 about one third shorter than row 2, composed of
fairly widely spaced dikinetids bearing 2-3 urn long, distally slightly inflated bristles,
posterior bristle shortened and rod-shaped. Brush row 2 like row 1. Brush row 3 extends to
near posterior body end, composed of monokinetids having about 4 ^m long, rod-shaped
bristles projecting at right angles from body proper; kinetids closely spaced anteriorly, where
the row diverges slightly and then curves right, producing rather conspicuous widening
between rows 2 and 3. All brush rows continue posteriorly as ordinary somatic kineties.
Oral bulge in vivo rather conspicuous because about 6 x 6 urn in size, distinctly set off from
171

body proper, and highly refractive due to the extrusomes contained; conspicuously anvil-
shaped soon becoming cylindroidal under slight cover glass pressure. Bulge surface flat to
slightly convex, without central depression and/or opening, in protargol preparations usually
studded with minute granules. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of rather
unevenly spaced dikinetids each bearing a single cilium; gives rise to delicate fibres extend-
ing anteriorly and to fine nematodesmata forming slightly conical oral basket (Fig. 32a, c, d,
33b, c; 315a, c, d, k).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and in a soil sample from a
small river floodplain between the village of Erldunda and Ayers Rock, Central Australia.
The sample from the type location, kindly provided by Mag. Hubert BLATTERER, was a
mixture of leaf litter (mainly from red gum trees and dried Myriophyllum) and light brown,
loamy soil, pH 5.2. It contained a very rich (about 80 species) mixture of limnetic and
euedaphic ciliate species. The soil from the second site was loamy and sandy, had pH 7.2, and
was covered with a dry algal crust. Possibly, occurs also in Austria (see below).
Comparison with related species: We found two populations of this species in
floodplain soils from Australia. They were very similar, except for the number of ciliary
rows, which differed considerably (Table 28). We did not separate the populations at species
or subspecies level because data about the variability of kinety number were sparse in
Trachelophyllum and the epicortical scales appeared similar, although a detailed comparison
was impossible because the scanning electron micrographs from the second population were
obtained with a different method (315o-s).
KAHL (1930a), the last reviser of Trachelophyllum, recognized seven species. Since then, nine
species have been described: T. flavicans GAJEWSKAJA, 1933; T. lineare LEPSI, 1960; T.
triangulatum TUCOLESCO, 1962; T. biacuminatum TUCOLESCO, 1962; T. sphagnetorum
GROLIERE, 1977; T. hyalinum FOISSNER, 1983b; T. attenuatum FoiSSNER, 1983b; Lepido-
trachelophyllum fornicis NiCHOLLS & LYNN, 1984, and Spetazoon australiense FOISSNER,
1994c. Furthermore, DUMAS (1930, 1937) described seven new species, most of which,
however, are pleurostomatids. None of these species matched the Australian populations to an
extent that would make identification beyond reasonable doubts; thus, we classified them as a
new species. In the following paragraphs, we shall compare only those species that might be
confused with B. australiensis.
As concerns shape, B. australiensis resembles T. brachy pharynx, which LEV ANDER (1894)
discovered at the Finnish Gulf coast near Helsinki (Fig. 32o). However, T. brachypharynx is
considerably larger than B. australiensis (350—400 urn vs. 150-250 um), has shorter
extrusomes (10-15 urn vs. 15-25 urn), and possibly lacks a distinct mucilaginous layer
because LEVANDER (1894) did not mention one. Furthermore, T. brachypharynx possibly has
three macronuclear nodules and two contractile vacuoles. Unfortunately, LEVANDER'S
description is meagre and no redescription is available for a more detailed comparison with B.
australiensis. We emphasize, however, that the considerable size difference strongly argues
against conspecificity. Further, care must be taken not to confuse B. australiensis with
Spetazoon australiense FoiSSNER, 1994d, which occurs in the same region, but has spherical
epicortical scales (Fig. 26).
Unfortunately, none of the marine Trachelophyllum species has been investigated with
modern methods. It is even unknown whether they have an epicortical slime (scale) layer.

Trachelophyllum vestitum STOKES, 1884 is similar to B. australiensis in many respects (size,
shape of oral bulge, extrusomes, nuclear apparatus, distinct mucilaginous layer), but has a
different shape (Fig. 32p, q). However, FOISSNER (1983b) assumed that STOKES (1884)
illustrated a contracted specimen and identified a slender species from an alpine pool with
STOKES1 creature, mainly because of the distinct slime layer and the conspicuous, rod-shaped
extrusomes (Fig. 32r-t). We do not hold this view any longer because STOKES (1884), a very
careful observer, definitely stated: "the length from four to five times the breath", which is
distinctly different from both FoiSSNER's alpine population and B. australiensis (6-8:1).
Furthermore, and possibly of greater importance, partially (315a) and fully (Fig. 32b)
contracted specimens of B. australiensis do not resemble STOKES' T. vestitum (Fig. 32q).
Likely, FoiSSNER's population belongs to B. australiensis.
Data for Trachelophyllum filum DUMAS, 1930 are too sparse to be reliably compared with B.
australiensis, especially because the measurements given cannot be transformed to modern
standards. However, the cylindroidal shape indicates that it is different from B. australiensis
(Fig. 32n).

Bilamellophrya etoschensis nov. spec. (Fig. 34a-q; 316a-m; Table 29)
Diagnosis: Size about 140 x 15 urn in vivo, highly contractile; slenderly claviform. 2
ellipsoidal, apart macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. Extrusomes rod-shaped,
about 4 urn long. On average 11 ciliary rows. Type I scales on average 1.1 x 0.7 um and with
6 polygons in superstructure; type II scales about 1.3 x 1 x 0.9 um, conical superstructure
composed of an average of 7 concave, meridional arcs.
Type location: Soil from margin (Sporobolus grass girdle) of Etosha Pan, Namibia,
19°10'S 15°55'E (site 60 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the area discovered.
177

Description: Size of extended specimens 90-150 x 10-20 urn in vivo, length:width ratio
in vivo about 9:1, after protargol impregnation 3.5-13:1, on average 7:1 (Table 29). Slenderly
clavate to fusiform with neck often slightly widened in oral region and gradually merging into
broadened trunk, slightly to distinctly flattened dorsoventrally. Anterior end conical and
hyaline, posterior narrowly rounded (Fig. 34a, b, h; 316a, b). Cells very flexible, amoeboidal
and contractile by up to 50% of body length under cover glass pressure, strongly contracted
specimens slenderly to broadly claviform (Fig. 34f, i); contracts and extends slowly,
preserved specimens thus of similar size and shape as live ones. Nuclear apparatus in middle
third of cell. Macronuclear nodules globular to distinctly (3:1) ellipsoidal, on average broadly
ellipsoidal; usually with rather irregular outline, fairly close together and connected by a fine
strand; nucleoli scattered, globular, minute. Micronuclei near or attached to macronuclear
nodules, conspicuously large, that is, 6 x 2 urn on average, globular to slenderly (4:1)
ellipsoidal (Fig. 34a, g, h, i, q; 316a; Table 29). Contractile vacuole in posterior end, with
single, about 2.5 urn long pore near pole centre. Only one type of minute and thus incon-
spicuous extrusomes in oral bulge, viz., rod-shaped, about 4 x 0.4 um-sized toxicysts, which
do not impregnate with protargol (Fig. 34a, b, d; 316c). Cytoplasm colourless and rather
hyaline, contains fat globules 1-5 urn across and some irregular, compact inclusions, likely
remnants of preyed ciliates. Swims rather rapidly and glides serpentinely on microscope slide
and among debris (Fig. 316a, b).
Cortex thin and flexible, covered by an about 2 urn thick, mucilaginous layer of epicortical
scales producing serrate body margin; serration more distinct in protargol-impregnated than
live specimens. Mucilaginous layer composed of two kinds of scales lying one upon the
other; individual scales minute and adhering to each other and thus hardly recognizable in the
light microscope (Fig. 34a, b, e, j, m-o; 316d-m). Type I scales on body surface, except for
oral bulge, tightly spaced, on average 1.1 x 0.7 urn and with 6 polygons in domed super-
structure. Type II scales also very tightly spaced, 1.3 x 1 x 0.9 urn on average in the scanning
electron microscope, baseplate broadly obconical, gives rise to an average of seven strongly
concave arcs forming conspicuous cone; produce serrate body margin in vivo and protargol
preparations, as described above, and conspicuously dotted surface in the scanning electron
microscope at low magnification (Fig. 316d-f).
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, rather widely and irregularly spaced, arranged in meridional,
equidistant rows, three of them differentiated to dorsal brush rows anteriorly (Fig. 34a-c, g, p;
316c, e). Brush rows 1 and 2 on average of same length and structure, composed of fairly
widely spaced dikinetids bearing acicular, V-like spread bristles about 3 urn (anterior bristle
of dikinetids) to 5 urn (posterior bristle) long; bristles immobile and obliquely attached to
body surface, thus entirely covered by epicortical scale layer and invisible in the scanning
electron microscope. Brush row 3 extends to mid-body, composed of monokinetids having
about 3 urn long, acicular, immobile bristles projecting at right angles from body proper and
piercing scale layer; thus recognizable in scanning electron micrographs (Fig. 316e). All
brush rows continue posteriorly as ordinary somatic ciliary rows.
Oral bulge inconspicuous both in vivo and protargol preparations because hyaline and only
about 3x3 urn in size, conical (very rarely cylindroidal) and indistinctly set off from body
proper, contains extrusomes as described above. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge,
composed of about 10 dikinetids each bearing a single cilium and a fine nematodesma
forming a conical pharyngeal basket (Fig. 34a, b, f-i, p, q; 316a-c).

Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, that is, a slightly saline,
reddish to greyish soil in the Sporobolus-Sueda girdle surrounding the Pan, and on the
Galapagos Islands, where it occurred in a sample containing darkbrown soil and much litter,
pH 7.4. Due to its narrow, flexible body, the species is well adapted to explore fine soil pores.
182

Comparison with related species: As mentioned above, B. etoschensis was also
found in a soil sample from the Galapagos Islands (Fig. 34n-q; Table 29). This population,
which was not studied in the scanning electron microscope, was highly similar to the
Namibian species, especially in having 4 urn long, rod-shaped extrusomes and about 11
ciliary rows. The specimens were, however, considerably larger (length in vivo up to 200
urn), the mucilaginous layer was more distinctly serrate in protargol preparations, and the
brush cilia were shorter (< 3 urn) and hardly V-like spread. These differences are small
compared to the conformities, and thus the populations are likely conspecific.
Bilamellophrya etoschensis is, in vivo, easily separated from its congeners by the minute
extrusomes and, in the scanning electron microscope, by fine structural details of the type II
scales. The general appearance of B. etoschensis is very similar to members of the —> T.
apiculatum group. The extrusomes, in contrast, are almost unique by their small size. Such
small extrusomes occur only in one other species, namely -> Trachelophyllum africanum.
This species is similar to B. etoschensis also in many other features, but not in the epicortical
scales.
Bilamellophrya hawaiiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 35a-l; 317a-h; Table 29)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 x 25 urn in vivo, slightly contractile; slenderly fusiform. 2
ellipsoidal, distant macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. Two types of extrusomes:
type I acicular and 12 urn long; type II rod-shaped, inconspicuous because only 2 urn long.
On average 13 ciliary rows. Type I scales on average 1.3 x 0.6 urn and with 8 polygons in
superstructure; type II scales about 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.2 urn, conical superstructure composed of an
average of 16 polygons.
Type location: Arable field soil between the village of Honomu and the Akaka Falls,
Big Island, Hawaii, l^OTM 155°10'W.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size of extended specimens 120-170 x 20-30 urn in vivo, usually about
150 x 25 (am, length:width ratio in vivo about 6:1, after protargol impregnation 4-7:1, on
average 5.5:1 (Table 29). Slenderly fusiform with neck slightly widened in oral region and
gradually merging into broadened trunk, flattened about 2:1 dorsoventrally. Anterior end
button-shaped and refractive due to the extrusomes contained, posterior end narrowly rounded
to bluntly tapered (Fig. 35a, j). Cells very flexible and contractile by up to 30% of body
length; contracts and extends very slowly, preserved specimens thus of similar size and shape
as live ones. Nuclear apparatus in middle third of cell. Macronuclear nodules broadly (1.5:1)
to slenderly (2.5:1) ellipsoidal, length:width ratio on average 2:1, stand out as bright blisters
from granulated cytoplasm, usually distinctly apart and connected by a fine strand, rarely
abutting as in -» Epitholiolus chilensis; nucleoli scattered, about 2 um across. Micronuclei
usually attached to macronuclear nodules, ellipsoidal (Fig. 35a, j). Contractile vacuole in
posterior end, with conspicuous, about 3 urn long excretory pore occupying pole centre
(Fig. 35a, j; 317f). Two types of extrusomes in oral bulge and cytoplasm (Fig. 35a, b): type I

conspicuous because about 12 x 1 urn and acicular with broadest site slightly subterminal,
does not form bundles in cytoplasm and does not impregnate with protargol; type II rod-
shaped and inconspicuous because only about 2 urn long, mainly attached to surface of oral
bulge, does not impregnate with protargol. Cytoplasm colourless and rather hyaline, contains
some food vacuoles with heterotrophic flagellates and medium-sized ciliates (Vorticella
astyliformis) and, depending on nutrition, few to many fat globules 1-8 urn across. Glides
rather rapidly on microscope slide and among debris.
Cortex thin and flexible, contains scattered, colourless granules (0.4 x 0.2 urn) and a faintly
impregnated fibre system very similar to that described in -» T. apiculatum; covered with an
about 2 urn thick, mucilaginous layer of epicortical scales producing tuberculate or indis-
tinctly serrate body margin both in vivo and protargol preparations (Fig. 35a, b, e). Mucilagi-
nous layer very hyaline and thus hardly recognizable in the light microscope, composed of
two kinds of scales lying one upon the other (Fig. 35f-i; 317a-h). Type I scales in single layer
on body surface, except for oral bulge, tightly spaced, elliptical, 1.3 x 0.6 urn on average in
the scanning electron microscope, domed superstructure with 8 polygons on average. Type II
scales upon and more loosely arranged than type I scales, about 1.3 urn across and 1.2 urn
high; baseplate obconical, gives rise to a conical, slightly concave superstructure composed of
an average of 16 scattered polygons.
Cilia 12 urn long in vivo and rather widely spaced because ciliated kinetids irregularly
alternate with slightly smaller, bare granules (Fig. 35j, I)4. Ciliary rows meridionally and
equidistantly arranged, three of them differentiated to dorsal brush rows anteriorly (Fig. 35a,
j, k). Details of dorsal brush as in —> B. etoschensis; row 3 only slightly longer than row 2.
Oral bulge inconspicuous because only about 3 urn across, button-shaped, distinctly set off
from body proper and bright due to the extrusomes contained. Bulge surface smooth and
without argyrophilic granules. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of about 12
dikinetids, each bearing a single cilium; gives rise to delicate fibres extending into the oral
bulge and to fine nematodesmata forming a conical, slightly bulbous pharyngeal basket (Fig.
35c, d).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location. The sample was taken
from the rhizosphere (0-10 cm) of a just ploughed fallow with remains of sugar-cane. The
red-brown soil had pH 6.4 and was mixed with litter and fine roots collected at various sites
of the field.
Comparison with related species: At first glance, B. hawaiiensis highly
resembles —> B. australiensis due to the body shape and the conspicuous extrusomes.
However, both differ in the fine structure of the type II scales (superstructure polygonally
faceted vs. composed of equidistantly spaced arcs), in the shape of the extrusomes (acicular
vs. rod-shaped5) and oral bulge (button vs. anvil-shaped), and in the number of ciliary rows
4 Although sometimes not mentioned, unciliated granules (basal bodies?) occur in all trachelophyllids
described in this monograph.
5 A difficult feature in this species because developing and exploding extrusomes of —> B. australiensis are
acicular like the mature, resting toxicysts of B. hawaiiensis. Interestingly, cytoplasmic extrusome bundles occur
only in -» B. australiensis; possibly, only rod-shaped extrusomes form bundles. This shows that even "minor"
features must be thouroughly documented because they might gain taxonomic importance when the group is
better known.
185

(13 vs. 24). —> Bilamellophrya etoschensis is also very similar to B. hawaiiensis in general
appearance and most morphometrics (Table 29). However, the extrusomes are totally
different (4 x 0.4 urn and rod-shaped vs. 12 x 1 fim and acicular) and the type II scales are
rather dissimilar (conical superstructure composed of six rather regularly spaced arcs vs.
polygonally faceted). Accordingly, -» B. australiensis, B. hawaiiensis, and -> B. etoschensis
are well-defined species easily distinguishable both with the light microscope and the
scanning electron microscope. Bilamellophrya hawaiiensis , is also different from the
Trachelophyllum species of the older literature, basically by the same features discussed in B.
australiensis.
Enchelyotrichajesnerae nov. spec. (Fig. 36a-n; 318a-h; Table 30)
Diagnosis: Size about 120 x 25 urn in vivo. Obclavate, contractile by up to 40%. 2
broadly ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules 20 urn apart on average. Extrusomes rod-shaped,
about 20 x 0.3 urn in size. Cortical granules approximately 1.5 x 1 urn, tightly spaced
forming plate-like layer. On average 25 ciliary rows and 9 dikinetids in long dorsal brush
row.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Dedication: Wilhelm FOISSNER dedicates this new species to Mag. Dr. Brigitte JESNER-
KRASSNIGG for her friendship over many years.
Description: Size 80-140 x 20-35 urn in vivo, usually near 120 x 25 urn, considerably
stouter in protargol preparations, where most specimens are contracted, often showing a
strongly wrinkled cortex, very much like trachelocercids (Fig. 36 1; Table 30). Extended
specimens claviform to cylindroidal, slightly flattened; contracts and extends rather slowly,
contracted cells roughly fusiform to broadly fusiform or dumb-bell-shaped (Fig. 36a, d-f, j;
318e). Macronuclear nodules in central body region, on average 20 urn apart, never connected
by a bridge or thread; elongate ellipsoidal to almost globular, on average broadly ellipsoidal;
nucleoli small, scattered, globular. On average four globular micronuclei near or attached to
macronuclear nodules (Fig. 36a, j; Table 30). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end with
single, distinct excretory pore in pole centre. Extrusomes conspicuous, although very slender,
because forming bundles in oral bulge and cytoplasm, impregnate strongly with silver
carbonate, while protargol stains lightly only some cytoplasmic developmental stages;
individual extrusomes slightly curved and 18-25 x 0.3-0.5 urn in size (Fig. 36a-c; 318d, g,
h). Cortex conspicuous because studded with compact granules about 1.5 x 0.8 urn in size,
similar to —> Pseudoholophrya terricola; granules form plate-like layer and usually impreg-
nate more or less strongly with protargol hiding the ciliary pattern. Cytoplasm colourless,
often contains many bright globules and indistinct food vacuoles, indicating that prey is
digested quickly; feeds on various ciliates, even on the very fast -» Phialina minima. Glides
slowly on microscope slide and organic debris.

Cilia about 10 um long in vivo, rather loosely spaced, especially in oral region, arranged in an
average of 25 meridional, equidistant rows distinctly separated from circumoral kinety and
differentiated to a complex dorsal brush anteriorly, except of about five ventral rows (Fig.
36a, g-j, 1; 318a-c, e, f). Right brush margin marked by a row of about nine inflated, up to 3
urn long, paired bristles; most other rows commence with one or two bristle pairs, followed
by some about 5 urn long, monokinetidal bristles mixed with ordinary cilia; some rows
commence with such monokinetidal bristles or with ordinary cilj.a, especially on ventral side.
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end, conspicuous because about 10x5 urn in size, bright
due to the extrusome bundle contained, and distinctly set off from body proper by a furrow
containing the circumoral kinety; disc-shaped to slightly convex in vivo and scanning electron
micrographs, while almost hemispherical in protargol-impregnated specimens; contains rather
thick, lightly impregnated fibres originating from circumoral dikinetids and extending spirally
to bulge centre. Circumoral kinety composed of comparatively widely spaced dikinetids,
associated with bulge fibres described above and fine, bifurcated nematodesmata producing
an indistinct oral basket (Fig. 36a, h-k; 318a-c, e, f)-

a non-flooded Petri dish culture. Measurements in urn. CV - coefficient of variation in %, M - median, Max -
maximum, Min - minimum, n - number of individuals investigated, SD - standard deviation, SE - standard
error of arithmetic mean, X - arithmetic mean.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was moder-
ately abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Family classification and comparison with related species: The
Namibian population matches the definition of Enchelyotricha FOISSNER, 1987b, that is, has a
188

special dorsal brush, as described above. In contrast, family classification is uncertain.
FoiSSNER (1987b) assigned Enchelyotricha to the —» Trachelophyllidae because of
contractility and general similarities. However, our new definition of the —>
Trachelophyllidae excludes both E. binucleata, type of the genus, and E. jesnerae because
they lack epicortical scales. Likewise, our new definition of the -» Enchelyodontidae
excludes Enchelyotricha because of the different dorsal brush. Possibly, Enchelyotricha is
related to the Lacrymariina (see —» Phialina spp.), with which it has three important features
in common, viz., contractility, many brush rows, and an oral basket composed of bifurcated
nematodesmata (Fig. 36k; GRAIN 1984, FOISSNER & FoiSSNER 1988).
Enchelyotricha jesnerae differs from the type species and sole congener, E. binucleata
FoiSSNER, 1987b, by the macronuclear nodules (widely separated vs. connected by a distinct
bridge), the cortical granules (very narrowly spaced forming a plate-like layer vs. loose,
inconspicuous rows), and the number of ciliary rows (25 vs. 17). Enchelyotricha jesnerae is
similar to several -> Trachelophyllum and Enchelyodon species, some of which possibly
belong to Enchelyotricha, for instance, Enchelyodon contractilis VUXANOVICI, 1963 (stouter
and spirally contracting) and E. retortus VUXANOVICI, 1963 (stouter and only 50-60 um
long). However, data are too incomplete for a definite classification.
Family Fuscheriidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Acropisthiina FOISSNER & FOISSNER, 1988 with enchelyodontid general
organization, that is, meridionally arranged somatic kineties, of which two, rarely three are
anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush rows. Oral bulge apical, circular, flat or domed and
with central opening. Oral dikinetids clearly separated from somatic ciliary rows, producing a
distinct circumoral kinety. Nematodesmal bundles originate from typical haptorid oral
dikinetids and from ciliated oralized somatic monokinetids.
Type genus: Fuscheria BERGER, FOISSNER& ADAM, 1983.
Further genera assigned: Actinorhabdos FOISSNER, 1984; Diplites FOISSNER, 1998b;
Dioplitophrya nov. gen.
Family Acropisthiidae FOISSNER & FOISSNER, 1988
Improved diagnosis: Gymnostome haptorids CORLISS, 1974 with spathidiid general
organization, that is, anteriorly curved somatic kineties, of which three, rarely two or four are
anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush rows. Oral bulge apical, obliquely truncate, ovate and
with dorsally shifted (acentric) opening in frontal view. Oral dikinetids indistinctly separated
from somatic ciliary rows, do not produce a distinct circumoral kinety. Nematodesmal
bundles originate from typical haptorid oral dikinetids and from ciliated oralized somatic
monokinetids.

Type genus: Acropisthium PERTY, 1852.
Further genera assigned: Chaenea QUENNERSTEDT, 1867; Sikorops FOISSNER,
1999b; Clavoplites nov. gen.
Classification: Originally, all genera mentioned above were united in the families
Trachelophyllidae (FOISSNER 1984) or Acropisthiidae (FOISSNER 1998b, 1999b). However, in
Namibia and soils globally, we discovered quite a lot of inconspicuous haptorids whose
detailed investigation showed that all have oralized somatic monokinetids plus haptorid oral
dikinetids, indicating that they belong to the haptorid suborder Acropisthiina, as defined by
FOISSNER & FOISSNER (1988). These species and some others described previously not only
have a conspicuous extrusome diversity, but also a different arrangement of the ciliary rows
and shape and structure of the oral bulge. We consider these differences as important at
family level because they likely have a different evolutionary history. The Fuscheriidae
probably originated from an enchelyodontid ancestor (for instance —» Enchelyodon), while
the Acropisthiidae likely have a spathidiid progenitor (for instance -» Spathidium). Most of
the species united in the Acropisthiidae have a spathidiid general appearance and were
classified as "Spathidium sp." in our notebook. Furthermore, they have an acentric bulge
opening, an important feature found also in some typical spathidiids, viz., Spathidium seppelti
seppelti PETZ & FOISSNER, 1997 and Arcuospathidium multinucleatum FOISSNER, 1999b,
which have, in addition to the usual long bulge (oral) slit, a minute, obconical opening near
the dorsal edge of the bulge.
Accordingly, the special type of oral basket likely evolved independently in two haptorid
lines. Certainly, this hypothesis needs further investigation, but the differences in the general
organization of the two groups are sufficient for a familiar separation, independently of their
evolutionary history. Chaenea QUENNERSTEDT, 1867 is now also assigned to one of these
families because LIPSCOMB & RIORDAN (1990) showed that it has haptorid oral dikinetids and
oralized somatic monokinetids.
Generic classification is based on extrusome shape and arrangement in both families.
Certainly, this is not a "strong" feature, but probably the best we have in these feature-poor
ciliates. The following key contains all described genera from both families.

Supplementary observations: Fuscheria terricola is common in soils globally.
Genus recognition is easy due to the uniquely nail-shaped extrusomes (Fig. 37e-h), while
species identification is sometimes problematic. The populations from Benin (Africa) and
Namibian site (49) differ from many others by the extrusomes, which are not 6-10 urn but
only 3—4 urn long. However, there are transitions, suggesting conspecificity (Fig. 37e-h;
333j; Table 31). This is emphasized by the morphometrics, which match the Austrian type
population.

ellipsoidal (5:1), reniform, C-shaped, or even somewhat tortuous; (iii) Several excretory pores
in posterior pole are (Fig. 37b); (iv) The extrusomes form a conspicuous bundle in the centre
of the oral bulge in more than 30 populations checked (Fig. 37c, i); (v) The posterior globule
of the extrusomes impregnate more or less distinctly with protargol, and thus the length of the
192

organelles can be measured in the preparations (Fig. 333j); (vi) The cortical granule rows
extend onto the oral bulge, where they form an iris-like pattern (Fig. 37j); (vii) There is a
single, ordinary cilium at the anterior end of each dorsal brush row (Fig. 37d); (viii) There is a
subapical ciliary condensation in the second kinety left of brush row 2 (Fig. 37b). This
condensation occurs in all populations studied (> 30), but its distinctiveness varies; (ix)
Dorsal brush row 2 has a monokinetidal bristle tail; (x) There are four to eight oralized
somatic monokinetids at the anterior end of the ciliary rows (Fig. 37c; 333k, 1).

Diplites arenicola nov. spec. (Fig. 38a-g; Table 32)
Diagnosis: Size about 55x17 urn in vivo; elongate reniform. Macronucleus ellipsoidal to
C-shaped. Oral extrusomes ellipsoidal, about 1.2 x 0.6 urn, body extrusomes rod-shaped,
about 2.5 x 0.2 urn. On average 9 slightly spiral somatic kineties, 4 dikinetids in brush kinety
1, and 3 dikinetids in brush kinety 2.
Type location: Dune soil (sand) in the Central Namib Escarpment north of the village of
Solitaire, Namibia, 23°50'S 16°E (site 33 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
193

Etymology: The Latin arenicola (living in sand) refers to the habitat the species was
discovered.
Description: Size 40-70 x 10-20 urn in vivo, usually near 55 x 17 urn, length:width
ratio about 3:1 both in vivo and protargol preparations. Shape fairly constant, elongate
reniform to bursiform, rarely cylindroidal, front half slightly narrowed with anterior end
transverse-truncate (Fig. 38a, b, d); unflattened and acontractile. Macronucleus in middle
body third, ellipsoidal to C-shaped, usually reniform, contains'many small nucleoli. Micro-
nucleus broadly ellipsoidal, about 3 x2 urn in vivo, attached to macronucleus at various
positions, rarely recognizable in protargol preparations because of many similarly sized and
impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, some
excretory pores in pole area. Body extrusomes in rows as long as body, rod-shaped, about 2.5
x 0.2 urn, that is, very fine and thus easily overlooked (Fig. 38a, d); do not impregnate with
the protargol method used, and thus their exact location (within or between ciliary rows)
could not be determined. Cortex flexible, contains some loosely arranged, bright granules
(mucocysts?) 0.2 urn across, so deeply furrowed along ciliary rows that small bulges become
recognizable subapically in swimming specimens; furrows extend onto oral bulge and are also
distinct in the protargol preparations (Fig. 38a-c). Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to
many fat globules up to 5 urn across. Likely feeds on small ciliates and flagellates. Swims
conspicuously slowly by rotation about main body axis, frequently almost motionless for
some seconds.
Cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, rather widely spaced, arranged in slightly spiral, equidistant
rows commencing underneath circumoral kinety (Fig. 38a-c; Table 32). Postciliary micro-
tubule ribbons occasionally impregnated, extend between ciliary rows, that is, do not form
bundles right of kineties, as in D. telmatobius (Fig. 38f). More or less closely spaced basal
bodies (dikinetids?) occur at irregular intervals in all somatic kineties, possibly produced by
just divided basal bodies, as indicated by the lack of cilia in the anterior kinetosomes. Dorsal
brush composed of two minute rows, right row in shallow depression recognizable both in
vivo and appropriately orientated, impregnated cells. Brush row 1 composed of an average of
four dikinetids bearing about 3 urn long, distally inflated bristles. Brush row 2 composed of
an average of three dikinetids having about 3 urn long, cylindroidal bristles; continues with
about 2 urn long, monokinetidal bristles to mid-body (Fig. 38a, b, d, g; Table 32).
Oral bulge occupies anterior body end, hardly set off from body proper and thus indistinct in
vivo, cylindroidal or cylindroidal with conical cap in about 50% of specimens, on average 5
urn across and 2.5 urn high in protargol preparations (Fig. 38a-d; Table 32). Oral extrusomes
ellipsoidal, minute but compact, that is, about 1.2 x 0.6 urn in size and refractive in vivo,
attached to oral bulge and occasionally lightly impregnated with protargol (Fig. 38a, b, d).
Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, produced by a horizontally orientated dikinetid at
anterior end of each somatic ciliary row; right basal body of dikinetids barren, left with an
about 8 urn long cilium. Oral basket very inconspicuous in live cells, composed of fine
nematodesmata originating from barren circumoral basal bodies and three to four basal bodies
at anterior end of all somatic kineties (oralized somatic monokinetids, see FOISSNER &
FoiSSNER 1988); nematodesmata extend to body midline and form small bundles rather
distinctly impregnated with protargol (Fig. 38a-d).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, that is, a sand dune in
the Namib Escarpment. The second species, —» D. telmatobius, also occurs in Namibia, but in
194

mud of rock-pools in a mountain river. Furthermore, Diplites spp. as yet have been found
only in Namibia and Venezuela, where another new species occurs. These data indicate
habitat and biogeographic specialization.
Comparison with related species: Diplites arenicola differs from —> D. telmato-
bius mainly by the shape of the oral extrusomes (ellipsoidal vs. clavate) and the number of
ciliary rows (9 vs. 16). Minor differences occur in body shape (elongate reniform vs. elongate
bursiform), course of the ciliary rows (spiral vs. meridional), and number of dikinetids
composing dorsal brush row 1 (4 vs. 7). Altogether, the differences are conspicuous and
species status of the two populations thus indisputable. Live observation is necessary for a
reliable identification because the extrusomes often do not impregnate.
No species was found in the literature that might be identical to D. arenicola. However, the
general body plan and the infraciliature are virtually identical to those of Fuscheria spp. and

Actinorhabdos trichocystiferus FOISSNER, 1984. Thus, these species are easily confused both
in vivo and protargol preparations. In fact, they can be reliably distinguished only by the
extrusomes, a rather sophisticated feature, which must be determined from live specimens
because the extrusomes do not usually impregnate with protargol and/or change shape and
size due to the preparation procedures.

Diplites telmatobius FOISSNER, 1998 (Fig. 39a-g; 304 1-q; Table 33)
Additional observations: This species was discovered at Namibian site (29). Here,
we report on some observations from specimens found at sites (49) and (73). The site (49)
population was also morphometrically analyzed and shows values highly similar to those of
the type population (Table 33).

The following observations were made: (i) Shape and arrangement of the oral and somatic
extrusomes are similar to the type in both populations (Fig. 39f, g; 304 1-n, q); (ii) The
somatic extrusomes are located within the ciliary rows (Fig. 39d); (iii) Cortex of site (49)
specimens with distinct ridges containing refractive granules, which occasionally impregnate
with protargol (Fig. 39d; 304o); (iv) Dorsal brush row 2 has a short, monokinetidal tail
composed of about 4 urn long bristles (Fig. 39c); (v) The fine structure of the dorsal brush of
site (49) specimens is similar to the type material (Fig. 39c), wlyle rather different in site (73)
specimens, in which the posterior cilium of the dikinetids is almost completely reduced and
the bristles of row 1 are directed posteriorly, while those of row 2 are directed anteriorly (Fig.
39b). Such differences might indicate subspecies status, although all other features and the
morphometrics agree with the type material.

Dioplitophrya nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Fuscheriidae with three dorsal brush rows and clavate and pin-shaped
extrusomes in the oral bulge.
Type species: Dioplitophrya ottinov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words di (two), hoplites (soldier ~ extrusomes), and
ophrya (eyebrow ~ cilia ~ ciliate), meaning "a ciliate with two types of extrusomes".
Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera: Dioplitophrya has an apical cytostome, straight
ciliary rows, three brush rows, extrusomes within the oral opening, and nematodesmal
bundles originating from oral dikinetids and from oralized somatic monokinetids (Fig. 40i, j,
1). Accordingly, it belongs to the family Fuscheriidae, as defined above. Dioplitophrya is
unique in having two types of extrusomes in the oral bulge.
Dioplitophrya otti nov. spec. (Fig. 40a-n; 319a-f; Table 34)
Diagnosis: Size about 100 x 35 urn in vivo; cylindroidal to elongate reniform. Macro-
nucleus U-shaped. Pin-shaped extrusomes 8 urn long, clavate extrusomes 5 urn long. On
average 26 ciliary rows.
Type location: Soil from the ghost tree forest (Moringa ovalifolia) in the Etosha
National Park, Namibia, 19°S 15°40'E (site 56 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Dedication: We dedicate this new species to Prof. Dr. Jörg OTT, Vienna University,
199

famous marine biologist and friend of the ciliates (BAUER-NEBELSICK et al. 1996a, b, OTT et
al. 1998).
Description: Size 70-130 x 30-40 urn, usually about 100 x 35 urn in vivo. Shape
basically cylindroidal with an average length:width ratio of about 3.5:1 in vivo, while only
2.5:1 in protargol preparations, where specimens tend to become inflated (Table 34); usually
slightly asymmetrical and reniform with posterior body end more broadly rounded than
anterior; unflattened and acontractile (Fig. 40a, f, n). Macronucleus in middle third of cell,
usually U-shaped, rarely a simple rod or C-shaped; fragmented into four nodules in two out of
40 specimens, likely due to postconjugational reorganization processes; nucleoli globular and
minute. Micronucleus not observed. Contractile vacuole in rear body end, many excretory
pores in posterior pole area; cortex often wrinkled when vacuole has contracted. Two types of
extrusomes in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm (Fig. 40a-c, e, i; 319a, b, d-f): type I
extrusomes as in genus Fuscheria FOISSNER, 1983b, that is, pin-shaped and 7-8 urn long,
form dense bundle in oral opening and impregnate lightly with protargol; type II extrusomes
as in Diplites FOISSNER, 1998b, that is, asymmetrically clavate and about 5 urn long, not as
numerous as type I, do not impregnate with protargol. Cortex highly flexible and rather
distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows in vivo, contains minute (~ 0.2 urn), colourless granules
having the same arrangement as the postciliary microtubule ribbons, that is, form long,
slightly oblique rows (Fig. 40m; 319c). Cytoplasm colourless, packed with 1-20 um-sized
globular and irregular fat inclusions in all specimens seen; some about 5 um-sized vacuoles
with granular content and cytoplasmic crystals from prey scattered between fat globules.
Likely feeds on ciliates. Swims slowly by rotation about main body axis, showing great
flexibility when squeezing itself through soil aggregates and under cover-glass pressure.
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, rather closely spaced (1.8 urn) producing nice metachronal
waves; arranged in an average of 26 longitudinal, equidistant rows commencing underneath
circumoral kinety and extending to posterior pole area forming indistinct, minute sutures.
Closely spaced basal bodies (dikinetids?) occur at irregular intervals in most kineties and
specimens, likely produced by just divided basal bodies, as indicated by the lack of cilia in the
anterior kinetosomes and the increasing number of pairs in early dividers. Postciliary
microtubule ribbons conspicuous in protargol preparations, occupy space between kineties
(Fig. 40a, f-h; Table 34). Dorsal brush inconspicuous because occupying merely 12% of body
length and having only 4 urn long bristles, usually composed of three rows, rarely of four (in
one out of 30 specimens); all rows of similar structure, that is, at anterior end of three
ordinary somatic kineties and composed of closely spaced dikinetids bearing rod-shaped,
about 4 urn long bristles; row 3 only about half as long as rows 1 and 2, but with short
monokinetidal bristle tail; rows slightly obliquely orientated in about one third of specimens
(Fig.40a,f,h,k).
Oral apparatus occupies most of anterior pole area, oral bulge ring-shaped and inconspicuous,
that is, about 10 urn wide and only 2 urn high in vivo; mouth centre slightly depressed,
contains extrusomes as described above. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed
of rather widely spaced dikinetids with only the left (posterior) basal body ciliated. Oral
basket inconspicuous in vivo, composed of fine nematodesmata originating from barren
circumoral basal bodies and about eight ciliated basal bodies in anterior region of all somatic
kineties (oralized somatic monokinetids, see FOISSNER & FOISSNER 1988); nematodesmata
extend to midline of cell, forming small bundles rather distinctly impregnated with protargol
and assuming a funnel-shaped pattern (Fig. 40a, g, j, 1).

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, a local biodiversity
centre with many new species (Table 5). When we re-visited the site in year 2001, we did not
find this species again.
Comparison with related species: Basically, D. otti is easily identified by the two
types of extrusomes filling the mouth, a unique feature not found in any other member of the
202

family or in other similar ciliates. However, recognizing the extrusomes requires live
observation with a high power objective (oil immersion)! Otherwise, D. otti is easily confused
with Fuscheria spp., which have a similar size and general appearance and are common in
soils globally. There are several species in the old literature resembling D. otti (KAHL 1930—
35); however, apparently none has two types of oral extrusomes, although these were often
not studied in detail. On the other hand, we cannot assign our species to any of these taxa
because the extrusomes are a main feature and can thus hardly be added to an original
description.

Sikorops namibiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 41a-o, 42a-o; 320a-r; Table 35)
Diagnosis: Size about 115x33 urn in vivo. Spatulate with obliquely truncate, about 9 urn
wide oral bulge. Macronucleus elongate reniform. Extrusomes obovate, about 2 x1 urn. On
average 14 ciliary rows and 11 dikinetids in brush row one, 14 in row two, and 6 in row three.
Type location: Bark of a Colophospermum mopane tree at the Bambatsi Guest Farm,
Namibia, 20°10'S 15°25'E (site 51 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
203

Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size and shape highly variable because small, slender theronts and large,
broad trophonts occur; variability coefficients thus high (Table 35). Size 80-160 x 20-50 urn
in vivo, usually about 115 x 33 urn, length:width ratio 1.8-5.5:1, on average 3.5:1 in
protargol preparations. Spatulate, bottle-shaped or elongate ellipsoidal, occasionally slightly
curved, anterior end usually < 10 urn wide and obliquely truncate, posterior narrowly to
moderately broadly rounded (Fig. 41a, c, h, j; 320a, b); theronts slightly flattened. Nuclear
apparatus in middle body third (Fig. 41a, h, j; 320a, b, i). Macronucleus elongate reniform,
rod-shaped, U-shaped or ellipsoidal, length:width ratio 2-7:1, on average 3.5:1, that is, about
30 x 8 urn; nucleoli minute or large and lobate. Micronucleus about 4x3 jam, usually near
mid-portion of macronucleus, often impregnates only faintly with protargol and shows a
fibrous composition. Contractile vacuole in rear end, several excretory pores in posterior pole
area. Extrusomes mainly in oral bulge, obovate, rarely broadly fusiform, about 2 x 1 urn in
vivo, compact and thus highly refractive; fusiform and up to 4 urn long in protargol prepara-
tions, possibly due to beginning explosion; clavate, hyaline and up to 5 urn long when
extruded (Fig. 41a, d-f, h; 320c, d). Cortex very flexible, contains about five rows of
colourless, highly refractive granules approximately 0.8 urn across between each two ciliary
rows (Fig. 41g; 320 1). Cells colourless, theronts hyaline, trophonts packed with small and
large fat inclusions and thus dark at low magnification. Feeds on small ciliates, such as
Colpoda steinii, which are ingested whole because still identifiable in the food vacuoles.
Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 8 urn long, rather irregularly spaced with some kinetids obviously unciliated
within individual rows, slightly more closely spaced in oral region. Ciliary rows extend
meridionally and equidistantly, anterior portion slightly curved. Dorsal brush in anterior
region of three dorsolateral kineties, inconspicuous and of ordinary structure, that is, consists
of closely spaced dikinetids with up to 3 um long bristles; usually some monokinetids or very
closely spaced dikinetids at anterior end of individual brush rows. Brush rows 1 and 2 of
almost same length, composed of 11-14 dikinetids on average; row 3 distinctly shortened,
consists of an average of only six dikinetids, associated with a monokinetidal tail of short
bristles extending to near body end (Fig. 41a, h, i, k, n, o; 320J-1, q, r; Table 35).
Oral bulge rather conspicuous, domed to spathidiform, that is, obliquely truncate occupying
anterior body end, obovate to broadly obovate in frontal view with extrusomes appearing as
bright dots. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, indistinct with details as difficult to
recognize as in congeners; not of ordinary structure, that is, consists of one, rarely two oblong
granules (very likely dikinetids with one ciliated basal body) at anterior end of somatic ciliary
rows and a minute, unciliated granule between each two somatic kineties, respectively,
dikinetids; each granule associated with a rather distinct fibre obliquely extending anteriad to
the acentric bulge centre, where the individual fibres converge and plunge into the cyto-
pharynx. Oral basket also very inconspicuous, not recognizable in live specimens and only
rarely impregnated with protargol, composed of fine nematodesmata originating from
circumoral kinetids and about six basal bodies at anterior end of somatic kineties (Fig. 41a-c,
h-o; 320e-h, m-p).
Observations on other popu 1 ations (Fig. 42a-o; 320j-r): Three other populations
were studied both in vivo and protargol preparations. This showed that body size (~ 60-160 x
10-50 urn) and shape and extrusome size (length 2-4 urn) are highly variable, while the

nuclear pattern and extrusome shape are stable and thus the most important features of the
species. The very characteristic, obovate to oblanceolate extrusomes, which highly resemble
those of —> Arcuospathidium namibiense tristicha, are difficult to recognize in all populations
due to their small size. In contrast, the oral bulge is rather conspicuous, in spite of being
rather small, likely because it contains the refractive and thus bright extrusomes.
The Australian specimens are very slender and have only 8-10 ciliary rows; thus, they might
be a distinct subspecies (Fig. 42d-f, j). The Venezuelan specimens, which could be cultivated
(see below), were studied in the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 320j-r). This confirmed
the lack of an ordinary circumoral kinety and revealed highly conspicuous bulge fibres,
similar to those found in Enchelys gasterosteus and Balantidion pellucidum (FOISSNER et al.
1995, 1999). Further details, see figure explanations.

Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location (bark of a Colophospermum
tree), at Namibian site 56 ("ordinary soil"), in Australia (sandy, saline soil from around roots
of halophytes at shore of Lake Amadeus near Alice Springs), and in Venezuela (mud from
ephemeral, granitic rock pools, so-called Lajas, near Puerto Ayacucho). The Venezuelan
specimens could be cultivated with diluted soil percolate and part of the natural protist
community. Sikorops namibiensis grew well for some weeks and preferred a large Polytoma
as food. These data show that S. namibiensis is an euryoecious ciliate and likely a cosmo-
politan, although Laurasian records are still lacking.
Comparison with related species: The Namibian population perfectly matches
the genus diagnosis of Sikorops FOISSNER, 1999b. This genus now already consists of four
distinct species differing mainly by the macronucleus: two ellipsoidal nodules with a single
micronucleus in between in S. woronowiczae FOISSNER, 1999b; long and filiform in S.
espeletiae FOISSNER, 2000b; reniform in S. namibiensis; and ellipsoidal in -» S. minor.
Furthermore, S. namibiensis has brush row 3 strongly shortened, while the other species have
row 1 shortened. Size, shape, extrusomes, and number of ciliary rows are rather similar in
most species. Likewise, the peculiar oral ciliature is very similar in all species and thus a
further genus or family character. In vivo, S. namibiensis is easily confused with Spathidium
claviforme (redescribed in FOISSNER 1987b) and Protospathidiwn terricola FOISSNER, 1998a,
which have a similar size, shape and nuclear apparatus. Fortunately, both have simple, rod-
shaped extrusomes distinctly different from the obovate to oblanceolate toxicysts of Sikorops
spp.
Sikorops minor nov. spec. (Fig. 43a-l; Table 35)
Diagnosis: Size about 65 x 15 urn in vivo. Bottle-shaped to elongate ovoidal with
obliquely truncate, about 5 urn wide oral bulge. Macronucleus ellipsoidal. Extrusomes
fusiform, about 1.5 x 1 urn. On average 7 ciliary rows and 5 dikinetids in brush row one, 10
in row two, and 5 in row three.
Type location: Highly saline, alkaline soil near the village of Himmafushi, North-Male
Atoll, Maldives, 03°N 74°E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective minor (small) indicates that it is the smallest described
species of the genus.
Description: Size 50-80 x 10-20 urn in vivo, usually about 65 x 15 urn; shrunken to 51 x
13 um in protargol preparations showing a length:width ratio of 3-5.5:1, on average 4:1
(Table 35). Lateral view indistinctly spatulate, obclavate, bottle-shaped or almost cylin-
droidal, dorsal and ventral view obclavate to elongate ovoidal with posterior end moderately
broadly rounded and anterior flattened up to 2:1 and bluntly pointed (Fig. 43a-d, g, i, k).
Macronucleus slightly below mid-body, broadly to elongate ellipsoidal, rarely distinctly
reniform; nucleoli small and globular. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus at variable
position, discoidal because flattened about 2:1, broad view outline circular to broadly
elliptical. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, some excretory pores in pole area.
Extrusomes only in oral bulge, fusiform, minute, that is, about 1.5x1 urn and thus difficult to

Dorsal and ventral view of a small, obclavate specimen. The first ordinary somatic ciliary row (arrowhead) left of the dorsal
brush kineties is slightly elongated and thus extends onto the oral bulge, which is conspicuously plug-shaped in this species,
if it is viewed ventrally or dorsally. Brush row 2 is distinctly longer than rows 1 and 3. There is no distinct circumoral kinety
recognizable, and the first basal body of each row is ciliated. DB - dorsal brush, DB1, 2, 3 - dorsal brush rows, OB - oral

recognize, do not impregnate with the protargol method used. Cortex very flexible, contains
about 12 rows of colourless, refractive granules approximately 0.3 urn across between each
two ciliary rows. Cytoplasm colourless, in middle third often packed with food vacuoles as
well as globular and irregular fat inclusions up to 6 urn across. Feeds on heterotrophic
flagellates and likely also small ciliates, both rapidly digested because prey organisms could
be not identified in the food vacuoles of protargol impregnated cells. Swims slowly by
rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, in some specimens rather irregularly spaced due to inter-
spersed, unciliated kinetids, closely spaced in oral region. Ciliary rows widely spaced, extend
meridionally and equidistantly, anterior portion curved, first row left of dorsal brush
invariably slightly elongated anteriorly and thus extending onto dorsal surface of oral bulge.
Dorsal brush in anterior region of three dorsolateral kineties, inconspicuous and of ordinary
structure, that is, consists of closely spaced dikinetids with up to 3 (im long bristles; two to
211

three monokinetids or very closely spaced dikinetids at anterior end of individual brush rows.
Brush rows 1 and 3 of almost same length each consisting of an average of four to five
dikinetids, row 3 associated with a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to mid-body; row 2
about twice as long as rows 1 and 3, consists of ten dikinetids on average. All brush rows
continue as ordinary somatic kineties posteriorly (Fig. 43a, f-1; Table 35).
Oral bulge inconspicuous because minute, that is, about 5x4 urn in vivo; basically spathidi-
form and slanted from dorsal to ventral when cell is viewed latetally, while flattened and thus
projecting plug-like when viewed ventrally or dorsally. No distinct circumoral kinety, that is,
ciliary rows simply end at base of oral bulge and the anteriormost basal body of each row is
ciliated and associated with a conspicuous fibre spirally curving to bulge centre. Oral basket
rods recognizable only in over-impregnated specimens, rod origin remained unclear (Fig. 43a,
d, f-1; Table 35).
Occurrence and ecology: The highly saline and alkaline (pH 8.6) sample from the
type location, kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang PETZ, contained much litter and some sandy
soil collected under shrubs about 2 m inshore. In Namibia, S. minor occurs only at site (56),
that is, in non-saline soil. Found also in Cedar Creak, Utah, USA. This shows that S. minor
very likely is a euryhaline cosmopolitan.
Generic assignment and comparison with related species: Although oral
dikinetids and oralized somatic kinetids could be not identified unequivocally, the general
organization, the fusiform extrusomes, and the considerable similarity with —> Sikorops
namibiensis suggest that such populations belong to Sikorops. Actually, S. minor largely
matches -» S. namibiensis, but all main features are half the size (Table 35). Thus, and
because S. minor is considerably stouter than —> S. namibiensis (2-3:1 vs. 3-4:1), they can
hardly be confused. However, we cannot exclude that the Maldivean species lacks oral
dikinetids; if so, it would belong to the Enchelyina FOISSNER & FoiSSNER, 1988.
Generally, S. minor is an inconspicuous species with few distinct features. Thus, it is difficult
to identify and to compare with older, often very incomplete descriptions of seemingly similar
species. There are three Spathidium species in the literature which have some resemblance to
S. minor. Spathidium cucumis BAUMEISTER in KAHL, 1931 (likely double number of ciliary
rows and longer, rod-shaped extrusomes; found in liquid manure); S. claviforme KAHL, 1930b
(with distinct, dikinetidal circumoral kinety and 12 ciliary rows; see redescription by
FOISSNER 1987b); and S. microstomum VUXANOVICI, 1962c (only 35-60 urn long and
distinctly narrowed posteriorly providing the species with an entirely different shape).
Furthermore, some Lagynophrya species look similar, but the sole species so far investigated
in detail has a distinct, dikinetidal circumoral kinety (FOISSNER et al. 1999).
Clavoplites nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Acropisthiidae with claviform, drumstick-shaped, or pseudofusiform
extrusomes.
Type species: Clavoplites edaphicus nov. spec.
212

Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun clava (club) and the Greek noun hoplites
(soldier), referring to the basically club-shaped extrusomes. Masculine gender.
Comparison with related genera: Acropisthium has rod-shaped extrusomes, and
in Sikorops they are fusiform or oblanceolate. The claviform/drumstick-shaped extrusomes of
Clavoplites edaphicus and C. australiensis are really conspicuous, making the species easy to
identify in vivo. A reinvestigation of the type material of Enchelydium terrenum FOISSNER,
1984 showed that it very likely has the same features as Clavoplites spp. Thus, it is trans-
ferred to this genus: Clavoplites terrenum (FOISSNER, 1984) nov. comb.6 The extrusomes of
C. terrenum might be classified as "fusiform" and the species thus referred to Sikorops.
However, the fusiform extrusomes of C. terrenum look different from those of Sikorops and
likely evolved convergently by shifting the broad portion of clavate or drumstick-shaped
extrusomes to the mid of the organelle, leaving a rod-shaped process anteriorly and posteri-
orly. Thus, we suggest that the extrusomes of C. terrenum are "pseudofusiform".
Clavoplites edaphicus nov. spec. (Fig. 44a-k, n, o; 321a-h; Table 36)
Diagnosis: Size about 100 x 35 urn in vivo. Spatulate with obliquely truncate, about 8 urn
wide oral bulge. Macronucleus rod-shaped to semicircular, 30 x 8 urn on average. Extru-
somes conspicuously clavate, 3—4 x 1.3-1.7 urn in size. On average 17 ciliary rows, 3
anteriorly differentiated to inconspicuous dorsal brush.
Type location: Red, sandy soil under shrubs between the village of Erldunda and the
Ayers Rock, Australia, 26°S 132°30'E.
Etymology: Edaphicus (from the Greek Edaphon) because living in soil.
Description: Shape highly variable because slender theronts and broad trophonts occur,
although the protargol slides contain mainly early and late trophonts (Table 36). Size 80-120
x 25-60 um, usually near 100 x 35 urn in vivo, length:width ratio 1.7-3.3:1, on average 2.7:1
in protargol preparations. Usually slenderly to broadly spatulate with anterior portion slightly
contractile and curved dorsally, providing cells with a Spathidium claviforme-like appearance.
Anterior end obliquely truncate and < 10 urn wide, posterior narrowly to broadly rounded,
widest in mid-body (Fig. 44a, i, j). Nuclear apparatus in middle body third (Fig. 44a, c, d, i;
32Tg). Macronucleus rod-shaped, elongate reniform, semicircular or ellipsoidal, on average
about 30 x 10 jxm both in vivo and protargol preparations; nucleoli minute to large and lobate.
Micronucleus conspicuous because about 5 x4 urn in vivo, near or in mid-portion of
macronucleus, surrounded by a distinct membrane. Contractile vacuole in rear end, several
excretory pores in pole area. Extrusomes arranged ring-like in oral bulge, some scattered in
cytoplasm, conspicuous because broadly clavate, that is, 3-4 x 1.3-1.7 urn in size, attached
with a minute dome at broad end to oral bulge, impregnate rather intensely with protargol
(Fig. 44a, e, j, n, o; 321a-h; Table 36). Cortex very flexible, contains about five rows of
6 FOISSNER (1984) did not provide the etymology of the species' name. We consider it as a noun in apposition,
meaning "living in soil"!

Scale bars 5 um.
colourless granules approximately 0.2 urn across between each two ciliary rows. Cells
colourless, but trophonts appear dark at low magnification (< xlOO) because packed with
small and medium-sized, globular to irregular fat inclusions and food vacuoles. Feeds on
ciliates (Colpoda maupasi, Lamtostyla australis), which are ingested whole because still
identifiable in the food vacuoles (Fig. 44i). Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body
axis.
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, frequently rather irregularly spaced and with some unciliated
kinetids within individual rows, slightly more closely spaced in oral region. Ciliary rows
extend meridionally and equidistantly, anterior portion distinctly curved dorsally on right side
and ventrally on left; usually some rows shortened anteriorly or posteriorly, especially in
dorsal brush region. Dorsal brush in anterior region of three, rarely four dorsolateral kineties,
inconspicuous because occupying only 18% of body length on average and bristles merely up
to 2 urn long; usually some widely spaced bristle pairs at posterior end of rows 1 and 2 and
some ordinary somatic cilia at anterior end of all rows, but especially row 1. Brush rows 1
and 2 of almost same length and composed of 11-15 dikinetids on average; row 3 about half
as long as row 2, consists of an average of 10 closely spaced dikinetids, continues to mid-
body with a monokinetidal tail of 1 urn long bristles (Fig. 44a-d, g, h; Table 36).
Oral bulge 7-9 urn wide and 3-5 urn high, shiny due to the highly refractive extrusomes
contained; spathidiform, that is, obliquely truncate occupying anterior body end, obovate in
frontal view with extrusomes appearing as conspicuous, bright dots. Bulge (oral) opening
minute when not active, acentric, that is, slightly shifted to dorsal side and supported by thick
fibres originating from circumoral kinety and extending spirally over oral bulge. Circumoral
kinety at base of oral bulge, indistinct with details as difficult to recognize as in other genera
of family; very likely as described in —» Sikorops namibiensis. Oral basket hardly recogniz-
able in vivo, but rather conspicuous in optimally bleached protargol preparations because the
nematodesmata form distinct, somewhat irregularly arranged bundles; composed of fine
nematodesmata originating from circumoral kinetids and about 4-6 basal bodies at anterior
end of somatic kineties (Fig. 44a-c, g, h, n-p; 321f-h; Table 36). Obviously, the oral
apparatus is very effective and the bulge can open widely to engulf large prey, as described
above.
215

Occurrence and ecology: Found at type location (very sandy soil and litter under
shrubs in the "red centre" of Australia; pH 5.9), at Namibian site (28), in Tunisia (gypsum
semi-desert near the town of Makthar; greyish soil with much litter from shrubs; pH 8.0,
moderately saline), and in Rwanda (soil, mosses, and litter from shore of Lake Kibu near the
village of Kibuye). These data indicate that C. edaphicus is euryhaline and at least a Gond-
wanan cosmopolitan.
Comparison with related species: Basically, C. edbphicus is easily identified by
the conspicuous extrusomes. Body shape and size and the nuclear apparatus are highly similar
to the congeners, Sikorops spp., and small spathidiids, especially Spathidium claviforme, as
redescribed by FOISSNER (1987b). Thus only extrusome shape and attachment (with the broad
end!) remain as reliable features. Although they impregnate with protargol and hardly change
size and shape by the preparation procedures, they must be studied in live specimens at high
magnification (xlOOO, oil immersion) because other (or even the same!) protargol protocols
might produce different results.

granule. Fibres originate from these granules and the circumoral pairs and extend spirally to the acentric oral opening (see

Description and comparison with related species: The general features of
this species are highly similar to those of C. terrenum (FOISSNER, 1984), —> C. edaphicus,
certain Sikorops species, and some Spathidium species. Thus, we refer to the description and
discussion of —» C. edaphicus, the detailed figures, and the following main features of the
species.
(1) Clavoplites australiensis is larger than C. terrenum and C. edaphicus, but not very much,
and thus the extremes overlap (Table 36).
(2) The main feature of C. australiensis is the drumstick-like shape of the extrusomes (Fig.
45a, c; 32H-1). In C. edaphicus, the extrusomes are clavate and attached with the broad
end to the oral bulge (Fig. 44a, e; 321a-e, g, h), while they are pseudofusiform in C.
219

terrenum (Fig. 44 1, m). The arrangement and conspicuousness of the extrusomes of
Clavoplites remind of certain -» Enchelydium species which, however, have a different
shape of the oral bulge and a different nuclear pattern (FOISSNER 1980d, KAHL 1930a).
Furthermore, Actinorhabdos FOISSNER, 1984 (only two very short brush rows) and ->
Dioplitophrya from the family Fuscheriidae have similar extrusomes.
(3) Clavoplites australiensis has four dorsal brush rows on average, in contrast to the
congeners, which have three. However, the number of brush rows is highly variable in
Clavoplites and thus of doubtful value (Table 36).
(4) Some excellently prepared specimens show further details of the oral apparatus. Clavo-
plites has, like Enchelys polynucleata (FOISSNER & FOISSNER 1985), three oral fibre sys-
tems, which form a central, a mid, and an outer oral funnel (Fig. 45f, i, l-o; 321m-s): the
central oral funnel, the oral opening sensu stricto, is lined by fibres originating from the
circumoral kinetids; the middle oral funnel is produced by fibres within the bulge; and the
outer oral funnel is formed by nematodesmata originating from the circumoral kinetids
and the oralized somatic monokinetids at the anterior end of the ciliary rows.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, where it occurred together
with —> C. edaphicus, and at Namibian site (2). Obviously, this is a rare species whose
geographic distribution cannot yet estimated. However, it is remarkable that the European
member of the genus is a different species.
Enchelaria nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Spathidiidae (?) with small, obovate oral bulge. Ciliary rows curved at anterior
end, 2 differentiated to dorsal brush. Oral basket made of nematodesmata originating
exclusively from the anterior (di?) kinetid of each ciliary row (circumoral kinety).
Type species: Enchelaria multinucleata nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek noun enchelyos (eel) and the Latin suffix arius
(similar), referring to both, the slender shape of the type species and its similarities with the
genera Enchelys and Enchelyodon. Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera and species assignable: Enchelaria
a unique combination of features, viz., a two-rowed dorsal brush and an atypical circumoral
kinety made of the anterior kinetid of each somatic ciliary row. This and the anteriorly curved
kineties resemble the —» Acropisthiidae. However, Enchelaria lacks oralized somatic
monokinetids, although we cannot entirely exclude that the anterior kinetid is an oralized
somatic monokinetid. If so, Enchelaria still is a distinct genus because then it would lack the
haptorid oral dikinetids so typical for the -> Acropisthiidae and —> Fuscheriidae. On the other
hand, the lack of oral dikinetids would relate Enchelaria to the Enchelyidae which, however,
invariably have several oralized monokinetids at the anterior end of the ciliary rows.
The general appearance of Enchelaria multinucleata also resembles Chaenea (a —> fuscheriid
genus with oralized somatic monokinetids at the anterior end of the kineties; see FOISSNER
1984 and LiPSCOMB & RiORDAN 1990) and -+ Enchelyodon which, however, has straight
220

ciliary rows, a circular oral bulge, and a circumoral kinety composed of much more dikinetids
than ciliary rows. Thus, we propose that Enchelaria is related to the Spathidiidae which not
only have anteriorly curved ciliary rows, but also contain genera with a button-shaped oral
bulge (several —• Protospathidiwn and —» Arcuospathidium species). However, most genera
of the Spathidiidae have three dorsal brush rows and much more circumoral dikinetids than
ciliary rows, including -» Semispathidium, which highly resembles Enchelaria at first glance.
To sum up, Enchelaria multinucleata represents a distinct genus, no matter the familial
classification.
As yet, Enchelaria is monotypic, but it is likely that some of the many Enchelys, Enchelyo-
don, and Spathidium species described will be transferred to Enchelaria upon detailed
reinvestigation. In fact, we found some specimens of a second species with rows of body
extrusomes and a vermiform macronucleus at Namibian site (49).
Enchelaria multinucleata nov. spec. (Fig. 46a-h; 307a, b; Table 37)
Diagnosis: Size about 160 x 20 urn in vivo; cylindroidal. On average 127 scattered,
ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules and 12 globular micronuclei. Extrusomes fusiform, about 5
x 1 urn. On average 16 ciliary rows. Brush rows with about 20 dikinetids each.
Type location: Soil from Aloe dichotoma forest near the Gariganus Guest Farm,
Namibia, 26°30'S 18°25'E (site 5 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words multi (many) and nucleus, referring to a main
feature of the species, viz., its many macronuclear nodules.
Description: Size 110-200 x 15-30 urn in vivo, usually about 160 x 20 urn, length:
width ratio also highly variable, viz., 5-9:1, on average about 7:1 in protargol preparations.
Slenderly flask-shaped or cylindroidal with subapical portion slightly widened (Fig. 46a, c;
307a; Table 37); acontractile and unflattened. Nuclear apparatus scattered, frequently slightly
concentrated in middle third of cell, consists of an average of 127 macronuclear nodules and 9
globular micronuclei (Fig. 46d); individual macronuclear nodules globular to elongate
ellipsoidal, contain some small nucleoli. Contractile vacuole in rear body end, some excretory
pores in posterior pole area. Extrusomes in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, fusiform to
lanceolate, about 4-6 x 1 urn, those in cytoplasm impregnate faintly with protargol (Fig. 46a,
b). Cortex very flexible, contains rows of minute, colourless granules. Cells colourless, but
usually dark at low magnification (< xlOO) because packed with lipid droplets and macro-
nuclear nodules. Likely feeds on ciliates, as indicated by the lipid droplets. Swims rather
rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 12 urn long, form nice metachronal waves, arranged in about 17 bipolar,
equidistant rows slightly curved and more densely ciliated in oral area; some rows shortened
anteriorly and loosely ciliated. Brush inconspicuous, consists of two rows occupying about
18% of body length; row 1 composed of 3-4 urn long, distally slightly inflated bristles, row 2
consists of 2-3 urn long bristles associated with the anterior basal body of the dikinetids and
of 4-5 urn long, distally slightly inflated bristles associated with the posterior basal body of
the dikinetids (Fig. 46a, c, e-h).

222

Oral apparatus occupies anterior pole area (Fig. 46a, e-h; 307b). Oral bulge button-shaped
and distinctly projecting from body proper in vivo and protargol preparations, ovate in frontal
view with narrowed end directed to dorsal brush side. No distinct circumoral kinety: each
ciliary row commences with a slightly enlarged granule, likely a dikinetid or an oralized
somatic monokinetid; other oralized somatic kinetids not recognizable, not even in over-
stained specimens. Oral basket laterally flattened, inconspicuous, although about 50 urn long,
because composed of only few, widely spaced, fine rods originating from first kinetid of
ciliary rows.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it occurred two
weeks after rewetting the sample. Abundance was very low, that is, about 30 cells in 16
slides. With its slender body, the species is well-adapted to the sandy habitat.
Comparison with related species: Enchelaria is monotypic, andE. multinucleata
is easily identified, both in vivo and protargol slides, by the slender body, the numerous
macronuclear nodules, the fusiform extrusomes, and the two dorsal brush rows. We did not
find a similar species in the literature. However, several marine ciliates, such as Chaenea
vorax and Helicoprorodon spp. have a similar shape and nuclear apparatus.
As mentioned above, we found a second Enchelaria species at site (49). It is about 200 x 30
urn in size, has a long macronucleus, rows of body extrusomes, three dorsal brush rows, and a

distinctly obovate oral bulge. The oral ciliature is as described in E. multinucleata, and there
is no indication of oralized somatic monokinetids at the anterior end of the ciliary rows.
Unfortunately, we cannot name this species because we did not observe it in vivo and the
slides contain only five specimens. The rows of body extrusomes and the three-rowed dorsal
brush suggest that it is even a new enchelariid genus.
Phialinides armatus nov. spec. (Fig. 47a-j; 327m, n; Table 38)
Diagnosis: Size in vivo 140 x 10 urn when fully extended, on average 100 x 11 urn in
protargol preparations. Cylindroidal with head and oral bulge distinctly set off from body
proper. On average 29 scattered macronuclear nodules and 9 ciliary rows. Extrusomes
drumstick-shaped and about 30 x 1 urn in size.
Type location: Rain forest soil from a small island in the Amazon River, Brazil, about
20 km east of the town of Manaus, Janauari region, 04°S 60°W.
Etymology: The Latin adjective armatus (armed) refers to the extraordinary extrusomes.
Description: Size about 80-150 x 8-18 urn in vivo when fully extended, usually,
however, more or less distinctly contracted and near 110 x 12 urn; contracts and extends
slowly up to 30%, real size thus difficult to determine; usually, however, very slender with an
average length:width ratio of 9-10:1 in protargol preparations (Table 38). Shape cylindroidal
to slightly cuneate or fusiform; unflattened; head distinctly set off from body proper, appears
as a minute process in swimming specimens (Fig. 47a-c, h; 327n). Most macronuclear
nodules scattered in middle third of cell; individual nodules small and globular to elongate
ellipsoidal, on average 4x3 urn in vivo and protargol preparations; nucleoli inconspicuous.
Micronuclei not recognizable. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end. Most extrusomes
attached to oral bulge, form a conspicuous, posteriorly diverging bundle in anterior third of
cell; individual extrusomes drumstick-shaped or obclavate, about 25-30 x 1 urn in size,
broadened portion 6-10 urn long (Fig. 47a, e, i, j; 327m, n). Cortex very flexible, contains
rows of rather loosely spaced, colourless granules about 0.3 urn across. Cytoplasm colourless,
contains many small food vacuoles with loose content and some fat globules 1-3 urn across.
Likely feeds on protists. Swims rapidly, but does not dart like most congeners.
Cilia 7-8 urn long in vivo, arranged in an average of nine meridional, equidistant rows, not
spiralling in contracted specimens; loosely spaced, except in anterior trunk region, where each
kinety has an average of three dikinetids or trikinetids, some of which have 3 urn long bristles
(Fig. 47a, f-h,j; Table 38).
Head and oral bulge rather conspicuous because about 10 urn long in vivo and distinctly set
off from body proper. Head barrel-shaped, of usual structure, anteriorly limited by a dikineti-
dal circumoral kinety, posteriorly by a girdle of widely spaced cilia. Oral bulge discoidal to
cylindroidal, contains tip of extrusomes (Fig. 47a, f-j; 327n; Table 38).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, viz., a floodplain
rainforest soil at the Amazon River (detailed site description in FOISSNER 1997d, site 22). The
species is well adapted to soil life by its slender body. The large extrusomes indicate that it is
an effective predator. Abundance was very low in the non-flooded Petri dish culture.

Comparison with related species: This population belongs to Phialinides
because it has a ciliary girdle between head and trunk (FOISSNER 1988a). Phialinides armatus
is a very distinct species distinguished from all members of the family by the large,
drumstick-shaped extrusomes and the numerous macronuclear nodules. All other described
species have shorter, rod-shaped or fusiform extrusomes and less than 15 macronuclear
nodules.

Phialina minima (KAHL, 1927) nov. comb. (Fig. 48a-e; Table 38)
1927 Lacrymaria minima KAHL, Arch. Protistenk., 60: 103.
Material: Soil from the surroundings of the Mzima Springs in the Tsavo National Park
West, Kenya, 03°S 38°E.
Description of Kenyan population: Size about 70-100 x 10-20 urn in vivo;
length:width ratio near 6:1 in vivo and about 5:1 in protargol preparations. Elongate
cylindroidal to fusiform because of gradually narrowing posterior body third. Head distinctly
set off from body proper both in vivo and protargol preparations, barrel-shaped, about 11x8
urn in vivo. Oral bulge discoidal in vivo, conspicuously conical in protargol preparations.
Acontractile, ciliary rows thus meridionally extending in prepared specimens. Macronucleus
in body centre, elongate ellipsoidal (2.5-3:1), rarely ellipsoidal (2:1), with many minute
nucleoli. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, lenticular, 1.5-2 urn across. Contractile
vacuole in posterior body end with short canal ending in pole area. Extrusomes mainly in
centre of oral bulge and head, rod-shaped, about 15 urn long, often form conspicuous
appendices when partially extruded in protargol preparations. Cytoplasm rather hyaline,
contains few to many fat globules 3-5 urn across. Swims extremely rapidly, frequently
changing direction.
Ordinary somatic cilia about 10 urn long, brush dikinetids associated with about 5 urn long
bristles, likely originating from anterior basal body. Somatic and oral ciliary pattern as in
other members of genus. Brush at anterior end of kineties frequently contains basal body
triplets.
Occurrence and ecology: KAHL (1927b) discovered P. minima in a sapropelic pond
near Hamburg, Germany. We found it at various sites of Namibia (Table 4) and in Kenya,
where it occurred in an alkaline (pH 8.6) sample containing soil and litter from the forest
surrounding the Mzima Springs in the Tsavo National Park West. Most samples were saline,
indicating that P. minima is a euryhaline species.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: This
species belongs to Phialina according to the classification by FOISSNER (1983b). Phialinas of
the type described above are difficult to identify, and many species have been described over
the years, mainly from limnetic and marine coastal biotopes (KAHL 1930a, VUXANOVICI
1963), but also from terrestrial habitats (FOISSNER 1998a). Although the African population is
probably a new species, we identify it with Lacrymaria minima KAHL, 1927b, mainly because
of the rather similar shape (Fig. 48e). However, we do not neotypify the species with our
material because it is from a different biogeographic region (Africa vs. Europe) and habitat
(soil vs. sapropelic pond), has a different size (70-100 urn vs. about 60 urn), a different
location of the contractile vacuole (terminal vs. subterminal), and KAHL (1927) did not
observe the nuclear apparatus.
Phialina vertens STOKES, 1885, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1983b) and SONG & WlLBERT
(1989), is also rather similar to the Kenyan specimens. However, the original figure, which
shows a dumb-bell-shaped organism with broadly rounded posterior end (Fig. 48f), argues
against conspecificity.

Spathidium seppelti PETZ & FOISSNER, 1997
Extended diagnosis (to include subspecies etoschense): Size about 120x25 urn or 150
x 30 urn in vivo. Spatulate with conspicuous, distinctly slanted, slenderly elliptical oral bulge
one or two thirds longer than maximum postoral width, and with or without conical depres-
sion. About 65 or > 100 ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules. Extrusomes rod-shaped, 3-4 urn or
228

5-6 um long. On average 21 or 28 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differentiated to moderately
conspicuous dorsal brush occupying 22% or 29% of body length. Brush row 1 composed of
14 or 27 dikinetids, row 2 of 18 or 40, and row 3 of 8 or 27 dikinetids on average.
Remarks: We split this species into two subspecies for the reason discussed under S.
seppelti etoschense.
Spathidium seppelti seppelti PETZ & FOISSNER, 1997 nov. stat.
Diagnosis: Size about 80-140 x 20—40 urn. Oral bulge with obconical depression and
about one third longer than maximum postoral width. Approximately 100-200 macronuclear
nodules. Extrusomes 3-4 urn long. On average 21 ciliary rows, with longest brush row
occupying 22% of body length. Brush row 1 composed of 14 dikinetids, row 2 of 18, and row
3 of 8 dikinetids on average.
Type location: Algal ornithogenic soil near an Adelie penguin rookery, north coast of
Shirley Island, Windmill Islands, continental Antarctica, 66°17'S 110°29'E.
Description: See PETZ & FOISSNER (1997).
Spathidium seppelti etoschense nov. sspec. (Fig. 49a-q; 322a-j; Tables 39, 40)
Diagnosis: Size about 130-200 x 25-40 urn. Oral bulge about two thirds longer than
maximum postoral width, without obconical depression. Approximately 55-90 macronuclear
nodules. Extrusomes 5-6 urn long. On average 28 ciliary rows, with longest brush row
occupying 29% of body length. Brush row 1 composed of 27 dikinetids, row 2 of 40, and row
3 of 27 dikinetids on average.
Type location: Soil from margin {Sporobolus grass girdle) of Etosha Pan, Namibia,
19°10'S 15°55'E (site 60 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the site discovered.
Description: Size 130-200 x 25-40 urn in vivo, usually about 150x30 urn; length:width
ratio highly variable, that is, 4—8:1, on average 5.4:1 in protargol preparations (Table 39),
cells with just ingested prey distinctly stouter. Spatulous, oral area often conspicuously axe-
shaped, flattened leaf-like and thus hyaline, more or less distinctly set off from cylindroidal,
opaque trunk by slightly narrowed neck; posterior body portion slightly tapering and evenly
rounded (Fig. 49a, 1-p). Acontractile but very flexible, can actively curve oral region laterally
by up to 90° (Fig. 49k). Macronuclear nodules scattered throughout trunk, globular to
distinctly ellipsoidal (up to 10:1, on average about 2:1; Table 39), contain 1-2 globular
nucleoli (Fig. 49e, h; 322i). Many micronuclei 1.5-2 urn across scattered between macro-
nuclear nodules, exact number difficult to determine because usually hard to distinguish from
similarly sized cytoplasmic fat globules. One contractile vacuole with about 6 excretory pores
in centre of posterior pole. Two types of extrusomes: type I in oral bulge and cytoplasm, rod-

shaped with slightly narrowed, rounded ends, 5-6 urn long (Fig. 49a-c; 322a-g); type II
recognized only in the cytoplasm of silver carbonate-impregnated specimens, rod-shaped,
about 3 urn long (Fig. 322b-d, i). Cortex very flexible, contains about 6 rows of minute (-0.3
\im), colourless granules between each two ciliary rows. Cytoplasm more or less densely
packed with 1-7 um-sized fat globules, except for flat and hyaline oral portion, depending on
nutrition (Fig. 49a). Feeds on ciliates, in pure cultures mainly on Halteria grandinella. Swims
rather clumsily but creeps versatilely on soil particles, showing great flexibility (Fig. 49k).
Somatic cilia about 12 urn long in vivo, slightly irregularly spaced, arranged in an average of
28 bipolar, equidistant rows, those of right side attached to circumoral kinety at acute angles,
while those of left side, which have 2-6 closely spaced cilia at anterior end, abut at right
angles (Fig. 49e, f, i, j; 322b-d, f, g). Dorsal brush three-rowed, a fourth short row occurred in
2 out of 20 specimens investigated; dikinetidal portion of all rows of about same length, but
number of dikinetids distinctly higher in row 2 than in rows 1 and 3; rows 1 and 2 consist of
about 5 jim long, fusiform bristles, which elongate to 6-7 urn near anterior end of cell, row 2
fragmented anteriorly in about half of specimens; row 3 like rows 1 and 2 in dikinetidal
portion, but continuing as a long, monokinetidal tail to near posterior body end with 2.5-3 urn
long, rod-shaped bristles irregularly alternating with ordinary somatic cilia in posterior body
half; all brush kineties continue posteriorly as ordinary somatic kineties (Fig. 49a, e, g, i;
322h; Table 39).

Oral bulge on average twice as long as maximum postoral width, inclined about 45° to ventral
side, narrowly elliptical with dorsal end rather distinctly inflated, bright because packed with
extrusomes; base surrounded by an elongate-elliptical circumoral kinety composed of closely
spaced dikinetids, which give rise to fine nematodesmata forming rather conspicuous basket.
No conical depression in bulge area (Fig. 49e, f, h-j, 1; 322a, b, d, f, j; Table 39).

Comparison with related species: There are three well-known spathidiids that are
similar to S. seppelti etoschense, especially in having a similar size, shape, and many
macronuclear nodules (Table 40); they are easily confused, especially in vivo. Further similar,
poorly known species are discussed in PETZ & FOISSNER (1997). The population from the
Etosha Pan is most similar to S. seppelti seppelti discovered by PETZ & FOISSNER (1997) in
Antarctica, except for many morphometric features, which only slightly overlap (Table 40).
However, there is also a differing morphological feature, viz., the conical depression in the
dorsal third of the oral bulge, which is lacking in the Namibian population. Thus, it could also
be considered as a distinct species. However, the conical depression in the oral bulge of
several spathidiids is a rather new feature, whose taxonomical significance cannot yet be
reliably estimated. Thus, we prefer to give the African population subspecies rank at the
present state of knowledge.
Spathidium turgitorum nov. spec. (Fig. 50a-r, 51a-y, 52a-p; 323a-v, 324a-t;
Tables 41-43)
Diagnosis: Size about 160 x 15 urn in vivo. Cylindroidal with oblique, obovate, thick
oral bulge about as wide as cell. On average 56 scattered macronuclear nodules. Extrusomes
slenderly rod-shaped, 3-4 urn long. On average 11 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differentiated to
inconspicuous dorsal brush occupying 15% of body length.
Type location: Highly saline soil from Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°S 15°50'E (site 54 in
figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective turgidus (thick, inflated) and the Latin noun
torus (bulge), referring to the comparatively conspicuous oral bulge.
Description: Several populations and ontogenesis were studied. Although conspecificity
is likely, the observations are kept separate and the diagnosis and description contain only
data from Namibian site (54) specimens.
Size 130-200 x 10-20 urn in vivo, usually near 160 x 15 urn when well-growing; slightly
smaller and stouter in declining state, viz., 100-200 x 10-25 urn, usually about 140 x 16 urn
in vivo; length:width ratio also highly variable, usually, however, near 10:1 both in vivo and
protargol preparations (Table 41). Shape conspicuous because like a rod or very elongate
spindle, even if well-fed; indeed, swimming cells look like moving sticks; flattened only in
oral region (Fig. 50a-e, j). Macronuclear nodules highly scattered, leaving blank only body
ends; individual nodules globular to elongate ellipsoidal, on average about 5x3 urn, contain
globular and lobate nucleoli (Fig. 50a, k). Micronuclei globular, exact number could be not
counted because of many similarly sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile
vacuole in rear end, some excretory pores in posterior pole area. Extrusomes accumulated in
oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, rod-shaped with rounded ends, slightly curved, fine,
viz. 3-4 x < 0.5 urn. Cortex inconspicuous, very flexible, contains loosely spaced, minute (~
0.2 urn), colourless granules, which can be extruded (Fig. 323u, v). Cytoplasm colourless,

b From flourishing culture.
c From declining culture.
Oral bulge about as wide as widest trunk region, slanted approximately 45° to main body
axis, conspicuous because rather thick and bright due to the extrusomes contained; obovate to
cuneate in frontal view, co-like curved when viewed laterally. Circumoral kinety cuneate,
composed of dikinetids occasionally rather irregularly arranged or forming distinct fragments,
like in Protospathidium (Fig. 50a, j, k, m-r). Oral basket rods not impregnated.
Observations on Namibian site (24) population (Fig. 5lj-r; 323a-v; Tables
42, 43): Specimens from the non-flooded Petri dish culture ("field material") and pure
cultures (Eau de Volvic enriched with some crushed wheat grains to stimulate growth of
small food organisms, such as Colpoda and Polytomella) were studied in vivo and the
scanning electron microscope. The field specimens are highly similar to those from type
location (Fig. 323a-h; Table 43), while the cultivated cells are considerably stouter, thus
looking rather different (Fig. 323i-v; Tables 42, 43). However, all main cytological features
(macronuclear nodules, extrusomes, number and arrangement of ciliary rows, structure of
dorsal brush) are unchanged. The following additional observations should be mentioned
239

(Fig. 5 lj-r; 323a-v; Tables 42,43): (i) The extrusomes are simple, straight rods with a size of
about 4 x 0.3 urn; (ii) Usually, the oral bulge is cuneate, rarely obovate or elliptical; (iii) The
dorsal brush bristles are slightly inflated and the posterior bristle of the dikinetids is slightly
shorter than the anterior, except for row 3; (iv) The last and/or penultimate dikinetid of brush
row 1 has an ordinary cilium associated with the posterior basal body in the six specimens
investigated (Fig. 323c, d, g, h, k, 1); (v) The monokinetidal tail of brush row 3 extends to the
second third of the cell and is composed of single, rod-shaped bristles; (vi) The proto-
spathidiid circumoral ciliary pattern is even more distinct than in field specimens, but only at
the left side (Fig. 51J-1); (vii) The oral basket is of ordinary structure (Fig. 511); (viii) Resting
cysts are globular (x = 41.8 urn, M = 41 urn, SD = 4.5 urn, SE = 1.2 urn, CV = 10.8%, Min =
36 um, Max = 52 um, n = 15) and have a smooth, 1-1.5 urn thick wall with a bluish shimmer
(not an optical artefact because recognizable also under interference contrast optics). The cell
is involuted like an iris diaphragm within the cyst.
Observations on a Tunisian population (Fig. 51a-i; 324 1; Tables 42, 43): The
Tunisian specimens match the type population in all main features, such as the number of
ciliary rows and macronuclear nodules; the length:width ratio; the thick, oo-shaped oral bulge;
the extrusome shape; and the structure of the dorsal brush. Thus, conspecificity is beyond
reasonable doubt. Differences occur in body length (longer by 18%), extrusome length (6
um), and the shape of the oral bulge (more cuneate). Most Tunisian specimens were covered
by epicortical bacteria (Fig. 51i).

Ontogenesis (Fig. 52a-p; 324a-k, m-t; Table 43): Spathidium turgitorum from Namibian
site (24) has been cultivated as described above. Thus, we could study ontogenesis in detail.
The genesis of the ciliary pattern is as in other members of the family (BERGER et al. 1983,
1984) and group (FOISSNER 1996c), while important new observations will be reported about
body and nuclear division. Generally, division of S. turgitorum is homothetogenic, holotelo-
kinetal, occurs in freely motile (non-encysted) condition, and most main events occur very
early. No changes are recognizable in the parental oral structures and brush rows. All basal
bodies develop intrakinetally without any special anlagen fields.
Body shape and contractile vacuole: Early and middle dividers are slightly smaller and stouter
than interphase specimens. Curious blebs of unknown function develop in the prospective
division furrow and above the forming circumoral kinety fragments (Fig. 52e-g; 324b, d).
The blebs become very conspicuous in middle to late dividers (Fig. 324e, i), but disappear in
very late dividers (Fig. 324j, k). Middle to late dividers are fusiform, that is, inflated in the
prospective fission area, and elongate to the ordinary length (Fig. 52h). Furrowing
commences in late dividers and produces two sister cells of equal size (Fig. 52i, j; 324m).
Proter post-dividers look like small, stout ordinary specimens, while opisthe post-dividers are
cylindroidal, slowly developing the species-specific body and oral bulge shape (Fig. 52k, o, p;
324n-p, t). The opisthe obtains the parental contractile vacuole, while the proter very soon
forms a new contractile vacuole and excretory pores close above the prospective fission area
(Fig. 52b-d, 324g).
Infraciliature: The genesis of the ciliary pattern commences with an intense, intrakinetal
production of basal bodies in all kineties underneath the prospective division furrow (Fig.
52a). The newly formed basal bodies soon become dikinetidal and separate from the parental
ciliary rows, producing small kinetofragments each composed of 4-8 dikinetids having only
one basal body ciliated (Fig. 52b; 324a, c). The opisthe's dorsal brush also develops very early
within the same rows as in the parent. In the brush area, the parental somatic cilia are
obviously resorbed, while new, paired bristles grow out. At the anterior end of the new brush
rows is an ordinary kinetofragment each (Fig. 52b; 324f-h). In middle dividers, the newly
241

formed kinetofragments curve right and have cilia of almost ordinary length. Furthermore,
intrakinetal proliferation of ordinary somatic kinetids (basal bodies) continues, producing
more or less distinct pairs (Fig. 52b, c; 324b, d). Production of ordinary somatic kinetids
likely continues throughout the life cycle because unciliated basal bodies are found in front of
ciliated ones in most interphase specimens (Fig. 323u). These basal bodies could be a
reservoir for somatic kinetids during division. Nematodesmata (oral basket rods) develop
from the newly formed kinetofragments when the division furrow becomes recognizable, that
is, in late and very late dividers (Fig. 52d). The opisthe circumoral kinety is formed from the
kinetofragments only during post-divisional shaping of the oral bulge.
Nuclear apparatus: When proliferation of basal bodies commences in mid-body, the macro-
nuclear nodules begin to fuse, sometimes showing fibrous connections or elongations (Fig.
52a, b, e, f). This indicates that the nodules could be connected by very fine fibres and/or the
nuclear membrane. In middle dividers, all nodules have fused to a globular mass in mid-body
and the micronuclei commence to divide in the usual manner (Fig. 52c, g). In late and very
late dividers, the macronuclear mass elongates to a rod-shaped strand that usually shows some
small branches (Fig. 52d, h-j; 324m). Thus, early post-dividers have a single, more or less
tortuous macronuclear strand (Fig. 52k, 324n). The interphase nuclear pattern is obtained by a
special process only in post-dividers (Fig. 52k-p; 324n-t): the macronuclear strand begins to
elongate and ramify until a three-dimensional reticulum is achieved which eventually breaks
into many nodules. This process likely takes several hours because many specimens with
incomplete macronuclear fragmentation can be found in preparations from exponentially
growing cultures. The individual strands of the reticulum are thinner than the single strand of
the post-dividers, indicating that elongation and ramification of the macronucleus is caused
both by thinning of the post-divider strand and production of new nuclear material.
In about 1% of specimens, the macronucleus consists of three to six, usually four rather large
globules. Such a pattern is found both in seemingly normal and dwarf individuals. We could
not clear how this pattern originates, but such individuals may even divide, whereby the
macronuclear globules flatten and occasionally break into up to ten pieces, which fuse to an
elongate mass in middle dividers.
Ontogenetic comparison: The genesis of body shape and infraciliature of S.
turgitorum is very similar to that of other Spathidium species (BERGER et al. 1983, 1984,
FYDA 1989, MOODY 1912) and haptorid gymnostomes in general (FOISSNER 1996C). The
species investigated by the above authors have a single macronuclear strand, which condenses
in middle dividers. Later, the globular mass elongates and divides once or several times (in
Homalozoon; LEIPE et al. 1992). Few data are available on nuclear division in multinucleate
haptorid gymnostomes (FOISSNER 1996C). However, each nodule divides individually in
multinucleate Dileptus spp. (JONES 1951, VINNIKOVA 1974), a genus traditionally considered
to be rather closely related to Spathidium (CORLISS 1979, FOISSNER & FOISSNER 1988). Thus,
it was a great surprise that S. turgitorum behaves entirely different: the nodules fuse to a
globular mass in mid-dividers. The mass elongates and divides once in late and very late
dividers. In post-dividers, the single macronuclear strand transforms to a reticular structure
which eventually breaks into many pieces. This mode of nuclear division is highly reminis-
cent of that found in most multinucleate hypotrichs, for instance, Bakuella pampinaria
(EIGNER & FOISSNER 1992).

Typically, multinucleate Spathidium species have a rather variable nuclear pattern, that is,
there are usually some specimens with a mixture of ordinary nodules and more or less long
strands or even only a single, tortuous strand among, say, 100 individuals. Now it is clear that
such cells are post-dividers, which are often difficult to distinguish from small, ordinary
specimens, especially late post-dividers. Actually, the multinucleate pattern of S. turgitorum
is entirely constant if only fully grown individuals are analyzed: all 25 very early dividers (=
fully grown cells) studied have only nodules. Thus, if in doubt about the macronuclear
pattern, early dividers must be investigated.

Occurrence and ecology: To date found at several sites in Namibia (Table 4) and in
Tunisia (detritus-rich sand dune from the Grand Erg Oriental near the town of Ksar Rhilane).
Spathidium turgitorum is a slender species and thus well-adapted to live in soil pores.
Furthermore, it is euryhaline.
Comparison with related species: Taking into consideration field and cultivated
specimens as well as various populations, S. turgitorum shows a high variability in size (about
90-250 x 10-35 urn) and ratio of body length:width (4-16; averages about 5-12), while the
extrusome shape and the averages of macronuclear nodules (about 50) and ciliary rows (11-
15) are fairly similar and thus the most important features of the species. Spathidium
turgitorum is closely related to S. procerum and S. anguilla, as redescribed by FOISSNER
(1984). It differs from S. procerum mainly by the macronucleus (many small nodules vs.
long, tortuous strand) and the shorter extrusomes (3-4 urn vs. 6-10 urn), and from S. anguilla
by the shape of the extrusomes (rod-like vs. fusiform), the thinner body (9-12:1 vs. 8:1), and
shorter oral bulge (about as wide vs. one and a half as wide as body). Spathidium metaboli-
cum POMP & WILBERT, 1988, discovered in saline soil from Australia, is also similar to S.
turgitorum. Unfortunately, the description of S. metabolicum lacks detailed morphometrics
and, especially, live observations on the extrusomes, which are "elongated oval, pointed on
one side" in protargol preparations, indicating synonymy with S. anguilla, as does the small
number (13) of macronuclear nodules. The extreme individuals of S. turgitorum overlap with
Protospathidium muscicola DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS, 1979 in all main features (Fig.
50s-y). However, average values are distinctly different (154 x 13 |im vs. 75 x 13 urn), and
P. muscicola has dorsal brush row 1 reduced to a few, indistinct bristles. Furthermore, the
circumoral kinety fragments are more distinct in P. muscicola than S. turgitorum (Fig. 50v-
y). For separation from -» Epispathidium polynucleatum, see that species. Certainly, all these
species look rather similar, especially when the considerable variability is taken into account
(Tables 41-43), but at population level they can be reliably distinguished by the shape of the
extrusomes and macronucleus, the dorsal brush, and morphometric details, such as the length
of the oral bulge and the ratio of body length: width.
Spathidium namibicola nov. spec. (Fig. 53a-w; 325a-r; Table 44)
Diagnosis: Size about 130x30 um in vivo. Cylindroidal or club-shaped with oral region
conspicuously curved rightwards and dorsally. Oral bulge massive, elliptical to obovate,
about 20 urn long. Macronucleus a long, tortuous strand. Extrusomes rod-shaped, about 5 x
0.5 um. On average 17 ciliary rows, 3-6, usually 4 anteriorly differentiated to indistinct
dorsal brush occupying 10% of body length.
Type location: Slightly saline litter and sand from centre of Sossus Vlei, southern
Namib Desert, 25°50'S 15°20'E (site 23 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of Namib (Desert) and the Latin verb colere (dwelling), referring
to the area where it was discovered.
246

Description: Size 100-160 x 20-50 um, usually about 130 x 30 urn in vivo;
length:width ratio also considerably variable, namely 2.9-6.0:1, usually 4.5:1 (Table 44).
Shape conspicuous, but only partially preserved in protargol and scanning electron micros-
cope preparations, because like a curved rod or club with oral region usually distinctly curved
dorsally and right laterally, exposing front of oral bulge more or less distinctly to the observer
when seen right laterally; cross-section circular, except for distinctly flattened neck region
and oral bulge (Fig. 53a, c, d, g, n-u; 325a, e, f, 1). Macronucleus a tortuous, indistinctly
moniliform strand in main body portion; if artificially extended about as long as body;
nucleoli branched, rarely globular (Fig. 53c, n-q, s, u; 325c). Several globular micronuclei
attached to macronucleus, number highly variable and counted in lightly impregnated
specimens with unstained cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole in rear body end;
excretory pores not recognizable in protargol preparations. Extrusomes accumulated in oral
bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, slenderly rod-shaped and slightly curved with ends
inconspicuously narrowed and rounded, about 5 x 0.5 urn in vivo (Fig. 53f; 325b-d, m, o-r).
Cortex almost smooth, except for furrowed neck region extending to oral bulge, forming
minute ribs separating the individual kinetofragments of the circumoral kinety; contains about
eight rows of approximately 0.2 um-sized granules between each two kineties (Fig. 53e, g;
325b, g, 1, m, o-r). Cytoplasm colourless, contains innumerable fat globules 1-7 urn across
and food vacuoles with crystals and remnants of ciliates and the heterotrophic flagellate
Polytomella. Swims rather rapidly.
Cilia arranged in an average of 17 equidistant, mostly bipolar, rather densely ciliated rows
abutting with several very closely spaced cilia on circumoral kinety in acute (at right side) or
almost right (at left) angles, as is typical for Spathidium (FOISSNER 1984). Dorsal brush
inconspicuous because dikinetidal portion occupies merely 10% of body length on average
and bristles only up to 2.5 urn long; rather irregular, that is, comprises three to six, usually
four rows, of which one or two are occasionally broken with ends overlapping. Brush rows in
distinct furrows, variable in length, with rather long portion of ordinary cilia anteriorly and
continuing as somatic kineties posteriorly; composed of paired bristles closely spaced in
anterior portion of rows and rather widely in posterior; last and often also penultimate row
have a monokinetidal tail of up to 12 bristles extending to second third of cell. Bristles longer
in anterior portion of rows (2-2.5 urn) than in posterior (0.5-1 urn); pairs of right brush rows
consist of a longer anterior and a shorter posterior bristle, while vice versa in the left rows
(Fig. 53c, d, h-m, v, w; 325a, f-j, 1-n; Table 44).
Oral bulge, although shorter than widest trunk region, conspicuous because 3-5 urn high and
packed with extrusomes, slightly to distinctly (45°) inclined to main body axis, obovate to
broadly elliptical when seen frontally, central portion distinctly depressed. Circumoral kinety
at base of slightly projecting oral bulge, obovate to broadly elliptical, composed of dikinetidal
fragments slightly separated, especially in scanning electron micrographs, by minute, somatic
cortical ribs merging into the oral bulge (Fig. 53g, h-m, w; 325b, i, j, n-r). Circumoral
dikinetids almost equidistant, each associated with a cilium as long as ordinary somatic cilia
and a fine, short (~ 6 urn) fibre contributing to the inconspicuous oral basket recognizable
only in protargol preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in two samples from the Sossus Vlei in
the southern Namib Desert. The samples were circumneutral (pH 6.2-7.7) and comprised
mainly plant remnants sieved off the sand.

Comparison with related species: Spathidium namibicola has a particular body
shape different from all Spathidium taxa described previously (e.g. FOISSNER, GELEI, KAHL,
LEPSI, VUXANOVici), except for two species now considered to belong to Protospathidium
DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS, 1979, viz., P. serpens (KAHL, 1930a) FOISSNER, 1981b
and P. terricola FOISSNER, 1998a. The latter has an elongate ellipsoidal macronucleus (~ 33 x
13 um; FOISSNER 1998a, PETZ & FOISSNER 1997) and is thus easily distinguished from S.
namibicola. Protospathidium serpens matches S. namibicola in many features, but has, of
250

course, a discontinuous circumoral kinety composed of short kinetofragments usually
comprising only four kinetids (FOISSNER 1981b, 1996a). The difference in the circumoral
pattern becomes indisputable when comparing appropriate micrographs (Fig. 325i-k).
Interestingly, the three species mentioned have a rather variable dorsal brush consisting not of
the usual three rows, but of three to six with an average of four rows in S. namibicola and P.
serpens. Thus, S. namibicola and P. serpens are difficult to distinguish in vivo; however, the
latter is usually smaller (< 100 urn vs. > 100 urn in vivo), especially as concerns the oral
bulge (< 10 urn vs. about 20 urn in vivo).
Spathidium rusticanum FOISSNER, 1981 (Fig. 54a-m; 327e; Tables 45, 46)
Description of Namibian site (5) population: Size 90-160 x 15-30 urn in
vivo, usually about 120 x 25 urn; length:width ratio 3.4-6.6:1, on average 4.4:lin protargol
preparations (Table 45). Elongate spatulate with distinctly narrowed neck; oral bulge about as
long as widest trunk region, neck and bulge distinctly flattened (Fig. 54a, e, 1). Macronucleus
in middle quarters of cell, basically a more or less distinctly moniliform rod with ends
frequently curved and coiled, usually as shown in figures 54e and 327e; nucleoli large and in
centre of nodes; becomes a globular mass in middle dividers. Several globular micronuclei,
exact number could not be counted because of similarly sized and impregnated cytoplasmic
inclusions. Contractile vacuole in rear end, several excretory pores in posterior pole area.
Extrusomes rather conspicuous because compact and comparatively thick, accumulated in
ends and right half of oral bulge, scattered in cytoplasm; individual extrusomes about 5-6 x
0.4 um, basically rod-shaped, but when investigated carefully somewhat fusiform and slightly
curved (Fig. 54a-c). Cortex very flexible, contains several rows of minute (~ 0.2 urn),
colourless granules between each two kineties. Trunk usually packed with up to 10 um-sized
fat inclusions, so that macronucleus stands out as whitish rod. Swims and creeps rather
rapidly.
Somatic cilia about 9 urn long in vivo, arranged in an average of 15 equidistant, mostly
bipolar rows loosely ciliated in oral and neck region, where some rows may be slightly
shortened; kineties abut, although rather indistinctly, on circumoral kinety, as is typical for
the genus (FOISSNER 1984). Dorsal brush inconspicuous because occupying only 10% of body
length on average, dikinetidal part of row 3 distinctly shortened, that is, about half as long as
rows 1 and 2 (Table 45); bristles similar in all rows, that is, anterior bristle of dikinetids
slightly inflated and about 3 urn long in anterior half of rows decreasing to 2 urn posteriorly,
posterior bristle slightly shorter than anterior, rod-shaped; row 3 continues to near body end
with 1-1.5 urn long, conical, monokinetidal bristles (Fig. 54a, i-m).
Oral bulge 3-4 urn high and slanted roughly 45° to main body axis, about as long as widest
trunk region, mid portion slightly depressed in half of specimens; elongate elliptical with
ventral half slightly narrowed, bulge ends bright due to the extrusome accumulations.
Circumoral kinety elongate elliptical, consists of rather loosely spaced and irregularly
arranged dikinetids, each associated with a cilium and a fine nematodesma. Oral basket
inconspicuous (too distinctly illustrated in original description, according to the type slides),
rods slightly concentrated in dorsal third (Fig. 54a, i, j, 1, m).

Occurrence and ecology: Spathidium rusticanum is a common species in Namibia,
but abundances are often low (Table 4). The type population was discovered in an alpine
grassland soil of Austria.
Comparison with original description and related species: The original
description of S. rusticanum is rather incomplete. The Namibian site (5) population matches
the Austrian type in all main features, although the macronucleus is less distinctly monili
form. However, a reinvestigation of the type slides showed that FOISSNER'S (1981b) figure is

too schematic in this respect, that is, the macronucleus is very similar to that of the Namibian
specimens. Thus, we are convinced that the Austrian and Namibian population belong to the
same morphospecies.
FOISSNER (1984) recognized a high similarity of S. rusticanum and S. anguilla VUXANOVICI,
1962a, which was redescribed by FOISSNER (1984) and AUGUSTIN & FOISSNER (1992). This is
emphasized by the present investigations, which, however, indicate that both are distinct taxa,
perhaps subspecies (Table 46). The most significant difference is the length:width ratio,
which is about 7.6:1 in S. anguilla (14:1 according to the original figure, Fig. 54f) and about
4.7:1 in S. rusticanum; thus, S. anguilla is much more slender than S. rusticanum. Another
important feature are the extrusomes, which are almost rod-shaped in S. rusticanum, while
fusiform in S. anguilla (Fig. 54g, h). Furthermore, the number of ciliary rows does not
overlap in two populations each (Table 46).
Generally, S. rusticanum is difficult to identify because it has hardly any prominent feature,
that is, looks like an ordinary "typical" Spathidium. The following combination of features
seems to be important: size, about 120 x 25 urn, and shape, that is, spatulate with distinctly
narrowed neck; macronucleus moniliform; extrusomes fairly conspicuous, that is, about 5 urn
long, rather thick, and almost rod-shaped; about 16 ciliary rows.
Late remarks: Observations on other Namibian populations showed that the nodulate
macronucleus is, indeed, highly characteristic and thus the most important feature of this
species. Accordingly, S. anguilla, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1984), is another species
because it has many scattered macronuclear nodules. It may be considered as the neotype of
S. anguilla. Spathidium anguilla, as redescribed by AUGUSTIN & FOISSNER (1992), has a
tortuous macronuclear strand and is thus another, likely new species. Obviously, the situation
is bewildering and must be cleared by a revision of the genus.
Spathidium etoschense nov. spec. (Fig. 55a-j; 327J-1; Table 45)
Diagnosis: Size about 160 x 25 urn in vivo. Spatulate with oblique, slightly cuneate oral
bulge about as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus slightly tortuous and approximately
60 urn long; several micronuclei circa 4 urn across. Extrusomes acicular, about 8 x 1 urn. On
average 10 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differentiated to inconspicuous dorsal brush occupying
12% of body length.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, lookout site "Pan",
Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E (site 57 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the area discovered.
Description: Size 130-200 x 20-30 urn in vivo, usually near 160 x 25 urn; length:width
ratio 4-8:1, on average 6.7:1, that is, slenderly spatulate with anterior body end obliquely
truncate and posterior narrowly rounded, but never tail-like (Fig. 55a, e; Table 45). Macro-
nucleus in middle third of cell, usually a slightly tortuous rod distinctly shorter than body
(1:2.6 on average; Table 45), in one specimen circular; contains many large and small
nucleoli. Micronuclei difficult to identify because of many similarly-sized and impregnated

cytoplasmic inclusions; fortunately, two dividers each unequivocally show three micronuclei.
Contractile vacuole in rear end, some excretory pores in posterior pole area. Extrusomes
accumulated in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, acicular and 6-8 urn long and thus
fairly conspicuous in vivo (Fig. 45a, b, d; 327J-1). Cortex very flexible, contains rows of
colourless granules. Cytoplasm colourless, packed with fat globules up to 8 urn across. Food
not observed. Glides and swims rather rapidly.
Cilia arranged in an average of ten equidistant, bipolar, rather densely ciliated rows abutting
to circumoral kinety in acute (at right side) or almost right angles (at left), as is typical for
Spathidium (FOISSNER 1984). Dorsal brush three-rowed (four in one out often specimens),
rather inconspicuous because occupying only 12% of body length and bristles merely up to 4
Urn long; all rows have some ordinary cilia anteriorly and continue as somatic kineties
posteriorly; row 1 composed of five, row 2 of eighteen, and row 3 of twelve dikinetids on
average (Fig. 55a, f, g, i; Table 45); details of bristles studied in only one specimen (Fig. 55j).

Oral bulge short, that is, about as long as widest trunk region, higher dorsally than ventrally,
obliquely truncate and slightly cuneate in frontal view. Circumoral kinety also cuneate and
composed of comparatively widely spaced dikinetids forming continuous row. Oral basket
rods not impregnated (Fig. 55a, d-i; Table 45).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at the highly saline type location,
where it was very rare (13 specimens in 14 slides). However, two dividers were among the 13
specimens, indicating that the population was growing when the sample was fixed for
preparation.
Comparison with related species: Spathidium etoschense resembles S.procerum,
S. anguilla, S. piliforme, —• S. extensum, and —» S. rusticanum. It differs from these species,
all described in FOISSNER (1984) or the present monograph, by the extrusomes (acicular vs.
rod-shaped or fusiform) and the macronucleus (conspicuously short vs. long, that is, body
length:nucleus length ratio 2.6:1 vs. < 2:1 on average; Table 47). The latter feature resembles
—> Apospathidium atypicum, which has fine, rod-shaped extrusomes and a distinctly narrowed
posterior body portion region. Spathidium elmenteitanum DlETZ, 1965 has a similar nucleus
as S. etoschense, but is only 65-80 x 12-18 urn in size and has very fine, 3 urn long extru-
somes. For separation from —» S. aciculare, see table 48.
Spathidium aciculare nov. spec. (Fig. 56a-l; 332e-h; Tables 47, 48)
Diagnosis: Size about 150x30 urn in vivo. Spatulate with oblique oral bulge about two
thirds as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus long and tortuous; several globular
micronuclei. Extrusomes acicular, about 8 x 1 urn. On average 19 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly
differentiated to dorsal brush occupying 26% of body length.
Type location: Grassland soil from the Botanical Garden in the town of Darwin,
Northern Territory, Australia, 12°S 131°30'E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective acicularis (needle-shaped) refers to the acicular
extrusomes.
Description: Size 100-200 x 25—40 urn in vivo, usually near 150 x 30 urn, length:width
ratio 2.9-6.6:1, on average 4.4:1, that is, slenderly spatulate with anterior body end obliquely
truncate and posterior narrowly rounded, but never tail-like; laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig.
56a, b, h; Table 47). Macronucleus in posterior two body thirds, highly tortuous, straightened
about as long as body (Table 47). Micronuclei attached and near to macronucleus, broadly
ellipsoidal, often difficult to distinguish from similarly sized and impregnated cytoplasmic
inclusions. Contractile vacuole in rear body end, about five excretory pores in posterior pole
area. Extrusomes accumulated in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, acicular and 7-8 x 1
urn in size and thus fairly conspicuous in vivo; do not impregnate with the protargol method
used (Fig. 56a, b, e, f; 332b-d). Exploded toxicysts drumstick-shaped, 15—20 urn long (Fig.
56g). Cortex very flexible and rather conspicuous because forming an about 1.5 urn thick,
gelatinous layer containing compact and thus bright, ellipsoidal granules in dense rows (Fig.
56c, d; 332a). Cytoplasm colourless, often packed with fat globules up to 7 urn across and
food vacuoles containing small and medium-sized ciliates (hypotrichs, Nassula, Pseudochilo-
258

donopsis mutabilis, Leptopharynx costatus), whose pharyngeal baskets remain in the
cytoplasm for a long time becoming conspicuous "teeth". Glides and swims moderately fast.
Cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, arranged in an average of 19 equidistant, bipolar, densely
ciliated rows abutting to circumoral kinety in acute (at right side) or almost right angles (at
left), as is typical for Spathidium (FOISSNER 1984). Dorsal brush dikinetidal and three-rowed,
rarely a fourth, minute row occurs right of row 1, rather conspicuous because occupying 26%
of body length on average; all rows have some ordinary cilia anteriorly and continue as
somatic kineties posteriorly; anterior bristle of dikinetids about 3 urn long in anterior portion
of rows, decreasing to 1.5 urn in posterior portion; posterior bristle about 2.5 \nm anteriorly,
decreasing to 1 urn posteriorly. Brush row 1 is the shortest of the three and composed of an
average of 23 dikinetids; row 2 is the longest and composed of an average of 34 dikinetids;
row 3 is composed of 27 dikinetids on average and continues with a monokinetidal bristle tail
to mid-body, rarely to near body end (Fig. 56a, i, k, 1; Table 47).

Oral bulge short compared to body size, that is, about two thirds as long as widest trunk
region; dorsally slightly higher than ventrally, obliquely truncate and elongate elliptical in
frontal view, surface flat to slightly convex, ends never inflated. Circumoral kinety at base of
oral bulge, oblong, composed of dikinetidal kinetofragments adhering to the somatic kineties
and frequently recognizable by minute gaps in between. Oral basket hardly recognizable in
vivo and very lightly impregnated with protargol, individual rods originate from circumoral
dikinetids (Fig. 56a, b, h-j; Table 47).
Occurrence and ecology: The soil (pH 7.1) from the type location is probably not
native; however, we found S. aciculare also at another site in Australia, viz., in rain forest soil
(pH 5.1) near Cairns. In Namibia, this species occurred only at site (48). Interestingly, S.
aciculare was accompanied by Enchelyodon armatides, both at the type location and in
Namibia.

Generic assignment and comparison with related species (Table
48): This population belongs to Spathidium, as defined by FOISSNER (1984), because the
somatic kineties adhere to the circumoral kinetofragments, especially on the left side. As
concerns the species, S. aciculare is most similar to Epispathidium ascendens, as redescribed
by FOISSNER (1987b), but differs in the shape of the extrusomes (acicular vs. rod-shaped) and
the oral bulge (oblong vs. dumb-bell-shaped) as well as the oral ciliary pattern {Spathidium
vs. Epispathidium pattern). Admittedly, the individual differences might be considered
inconspicuous, but together they are a firm constellation suggesting species rank, especially
since the differences were confirmed in several populations from various biogeographic
regions. Of the three features mentioned, the extrusome shape is the most important. In this
respect, but also in body size and shape, Spathidium aciculare resembles —> S. etoschense
which, however, has a comparatively short, rod-shaped macronucleus and only ten ciliary
rows; furthermore, the dorsal brush rows are distinctly shorter (Table 48).

Spathidium contractile nov. spec. (Fig. 57a-l; 328g; Table 49)
Diagnosis: Size about 160 x 40 urn in vivo; contractile by about 20%. Spatulate with
distinctly slanted, convex, cuneate oral bulge about as long as widest trunk region. Macro-
nucleus long and tortuous, usually composed of 10 fairly distinct nodules. Two types of
extrusomes: type I slightly curved, rather thick rods with bluntly pointed ends, about 5 x 0.5
um in size; type II 1.5 urn long, thin rods. On average 17 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differenti-
ated to inconspicuous dorsal brush occupying 15% of body length.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective contractilis (to be able to contract) refers to a main
feature of the species.
Description: This species was not very abundant, but present in the non-flooded Petri
dish culture for several weeks. Thus, cells from three sampling occasions were used for
morphometry, which increased variability coefficients to 20% and more because of several
small specimens found in the last samplings; in spite of this, we included them in the analysis
because they showed the minimum range and were well-impregnated. Ordinary variability
coefficients between 10% and 20% were obtained when the small cells were excluded (shown
for length and width in Table 49).
"Typical" size difficult to estimate due to contractility and the small cells mentioned above;
however, when growing well often near to 160 x 40 urn, with a range from 130-200 x 30-55
um; if the small specimens and one extraordinarily large cell are included, the range is
somewhere between 80-280 x 30-60 urn! Likewise, length:width ratio varies considerably,
on average it is near 3.2:1 in protargol preparations and 4:1 in vivo (Table 49). Shape
basically spatulate with convex oral bulge distinctly slanted ventrally, main body axis slightly
curved ventrally shifting posterior pole dorsally; flattened only in hyaline oral area. Con-
tracted cells bluntly obclavate, contracts and extends slowly and not very distinctly, but
shows conspicuous ridges with minute conical processes, which do not contain extrusomes
(checked with oil immersion), mainly in posterior body half (Fig. 49a, c, d, j; 328g). Macro-
nucleus on average in posterior two thirds of body and tortuous, when spread almost as long
as cell; rather distinctly moniliform in 32 out of 41 specimens investigated, with an average of
ten nodules connected by broad bridges and containing many ellipsoidal and globular
nucleoli. On average nine ellipsoidal, slightly flattened micronuclei scattered throughout
body. Contractile vacuole in rear end, 11 (n = 4) excretory pores in posterior pole area. Two
types of extrusomes scattered in oral bulge and cytoplasm (Fig. 57a, b; 328g): type I
conspicuous because comprising slightly curved, rather thick rods with bluntly pointed ends,
about 5-6 x 0.5 urn in size, only those in cytoplasm lightly impregnate with protargol; type II
rod-shaped, very inconspicuous because only 1.5 urn long, impregnates more or less
distinctly with protargol both in oral bulge and cytoplasm. Cortex very flexible, contains rows
of minute granules about 0.5 urn across in protargol preparations. Cytoplasm colourless, in
well-fed specimens packed with extrusomes and globular inclusions up to 10 um across,
leaving blank flattened, hyaline oral area; two cells contained up to 35 urn large, fibrous

aggregates, possibly parasitic bacteria. Feeds mainly on ciliates, for instance, Vorticella
astyliformis, which could be identified in the food vacuoles. Movement conspicuous because
slowly creeping showing slight, spontaneous contractions.
Somatic cilia about 8 um long in vivo, ordinarily spaced, arranged in an average of 17
equidistant, bipolar rows, which is few compared to similar-sized species, such as ->
Spathidium seppelti etoschense (28) and -» Epispathidium polynucleatum (23). Right side
kineties anteriorly strongly curved dorsally and distinctly separated from circumoral kinety in
266

ventral half of cell; left side kineties anteriorly with some narrowly spaced cilia and curved
ventrally to abut to circumoral kinety at roughly right angles (Fig. 57a, h-1; Table 49). Dorsal
brush inconspicuous because short, that is, longest middle row occupies only 15% of body
length on average, and having only 1-3 urn long bristles; basically three-rowed, but a fourth
or even fifth row occurs in almost one third of specimens; row 3 with a monokinetidal bristle
tail; all brush kineties continue posteriorly as normal ciliary rows (Fig. 57a, g, i, k, 1; Table
49).
Oral bulge about as long as widest postoral region, conspicuous because inclined to main
body axis by about 45° and containing many thick and thus refractive extrusomes; distinctly
convex, ventral outline cuneate to bluntly cuneate and rather massive because up to 10 urn
wide dorsally; contains rather thick, lightly impregnated fibres originating from circumoral
dikinetids and extending obliquely dorsally, forming an arrowhead-like pattern (Fig. 57a, e-1;
Table 49). Circumoral kinety cuneate to bluntly cuneate, composed of oblique dikinetids
associated with bulge fibres described above and comparatively thick and long nemato-
desmata, forming conspicuous bundles assembling to a large oral basket (Fig. 49g, h-1).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was moder-
ately abundant two weeks after rewetting the sample. Considering the habitat, it is impossible
to know whether S. contractile is a limnetic or terrestrial species.
Generic classification and comparison with related species:
Spathidium contractile has several unusual features, suggesting that it might be the represen-
tative of a new subgenus or genus. First, it is sole contractile Spathidium; second, the oral
bulge highly resembles Arcuospathidium; third, the macronucleus is nodulated, a rare feature
in the genus; and fourth, S. contractile has only an average of 17 ciliary rows, which is few
compared to similar-sized congeners, as listed above.
There are several species which are similar to S. contractile, viz., Spathidium moniliforme
BATHIA, 1920; S. truncatum STOKES, 1885; S. scalpriforme KAHL, 1930a; -> S. extensum
KAHL, 1933; and S. longinucleatum GELEI, 1954. However, all are acontractile, most of them
have at least twice the number of ciliary rows, and many have different extrusomes, if known
at all. The small specimens from the declining population look highly similar to Arcuo-
spathidium muscorum (DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS, 1979), as evident from figures
571-O. The three (sophisticated) features separating them unequivocally are the minute type II
extrusomes, lacking in A. muscorum; the micronuclei (many vs. one); and the left side
kineties, which are connected with the circumoral kinety in S. contractile.
Spathidium lanceoplites nov. spec. (Fig. 58a-l; Table 50)
Diagnosis: Size about 80 x 15 urn in vivo. Oblong to indistinctly spatulate with distinctly
slanted, obovate, minute oral bulge about 1/3 as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus
elongate ellipsoidal. Extrusomes lanceolate to ovate, about 2 x 0.8 um in size. On average 7
ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differentiated to inconspicuous dorsal brush occupying 16% of body
length.

Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun lancea (lance) and the Greek noun hoplites
(soldier ~ extrusome), referring to the lanceolate extrusomes.
Description: Size 45-130 x 10-20 urn in vivo, usually near 80 x 15 urn; length:width
ratio also highly variable, viz., 3.5-6.5:1, on average 5.2:1 in protargol preparations, up to 8:1
in vivo (Fig. 58b; Table 50). Shape inconspicuous, that is, oblong to indistinctly spatulate,
rarely almost cylindroidal, slightly flattened only in oral area (Fig. 58a, e). Nuclear apparatus
on average slightly underneath mid-body, consists of an ellipsoidal (2:1) to elongate
ellipsoidal (3:1) macronucleus with lobate nucleoli and a broadly ellipsoidal micronucleus
attached to macronucleus. Contractile vacuole in rear end, several excretory pores subtermi-
nal on left side. Extrusomes scattered in oral bulge and cytoplasm; bulge extrusomes slightly
asymmetrical, lanceolate to ovate, although minute, that is, about 1.5-2 x 0.8 urn, rather
distinct because strongly refractive in vivo; posterior half occasionally impregnates with the
protargol method used (Fig. 58a, b, i-k). Cortex flexible, contains comparatively widely spaced

rows of loosely arranged, minute granules about 0.3 urn across. Cytoplasm colourless, in
well-fed specimens packed with lipid droplets up to 6 urn across, leaving blank oral area,
which is thus hyaline. Likely feeds on protists, as indicated by the fatty inclusions. Movement
without peculiarities.
Somatic cilia about 7 urn long in vivo and ordinarily spaced, arranged in an average of only
seven equidistant, bipolar kineties anteriorly forming a Spathidium-pattem (FOISSNER 1984),
which, however, is rather indistinct due to the low number of rows. Dorsal brush occupies
anterior left side of cell, of usual structure, inconspicuous because occupying only 16% of
body length and bristles merely up to 4 urn long. Brush row 1 composed of an average of
eight bristles; middle row 2 slightly longer than row 1 and distinctly longer than dikinetidal
portion of row 3, composed of an average of ten dikinetids; anterior portion of row 3
composed of an average of six dikinetids, followed by about eight 1 urn long bristles forming
a tail extending to mid-body (Fig. 58a, c-h; Table 50).
Oral bulge minute because less than half as long as widest trunk region, but rather conspicu-
ous due to the refractive and thus bright extrusomes contained; moderately convex in lateral
view and distinctly obovate when viewed ventrally. Circumoral kinety also obovate,
composed of few, comparatively loosely spaced dikinetids associated with fine nemato-
desmata forming a conspicuously conical oral basket (Fig. 58a, b, d-i; Table 50).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, i.e., a semiterrestrial
biotope, and at site (33), that is, a sand dune in the Namib Escarpment, indicating that it
prefers terrestrial habitats. Spathidium lanceoplites is well adapted to soil life by the small,
slender body.
Comparison with related species: Spathidium lanceoplites has the same size,
shape, and nuclear apparatus as S. claviforme and Protospathidium terricola, as described by
FOISSNER (1987b) and FOISSNER (1998a). In spite of this, in vivo it is easily separated from
these species by the minute extrusomes (lanceolate and 1.5-2 urn vs. 4-6 urn long, fine rods)
and the small number of ciliary rows (on average 7 vs. 12, respectively, 21).
Spathidium lanceoplites is also rather similar to S. vermiculus, which KAHL (1926, 1930a)
discovered in a moorland drain filled with decaying leaves. However, S. vermiculus is smaller
(50 urn) and has rod-shaped, 3.3 urn long extrusomes and a longer oral bulge about as wide as
the broadest trunk region.
Spathidium extensum KAHL, 1933 (Fig. 59a-n; Table 51)
Improved diagnosis: Size about 220 x 30 urn in vivo. Spatulate with steep, massive,
elliptical oral bulge slightly longer than widest trunk region. Macronucleus in about 10
irregular pieces or in one or more tortuous strands. Extrusomes rod-shaped, thick, about 5x1
urn. On average 17 ciliary rows, 3 to 4 anteriorly differentiated to distinct dorsal brush
occupying 23% of body length.
Description of Namibian site (54) population: Size 150-250 x 20-40 urn in
vivo, usually about 220 x 30 urn, rarely over-sized specimens of up to 330 urn occur, and early

to middle dividers may reach up to 400 urn; length: width ratio also highly variable, viz. 5-
10:1, on average 7:1. Shape inconspicuous, that is, more or less distinctly spatulate or
fusiform with neck usually narrowed and oral bulge distinctly slanted; acontractile and
flattened only in oral and neck region (Fig. 59a, c). Macronucleus highly variable, a single or
two tortuous strands in about one third of specimens, 3 to 21 globular to very elongate pieces
in the others; pieces frequently in more or less distinct series, indicating that they arise by
fragmentation of a tortuous strand (Fig. 59a, c, i, j). See discussion for an explanation. Many
globular micronuclei, exact number could not be counted because of many similarly sized and
impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole in rear end, some excretory pores in
posterior pole area. Extrusomes accumulated in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, rod-
shaped or slightly fusiform with rounded ends, conspicuous because about 5-6 x 1 urn, that
is, rather thick (Fig. 59a, b, f). Cortex very flexible, contains about six rows of minute (< 0.5
Urn) but compact, colourless granules between each two ciliary rows. Cytoplasm colourless,
packed with fat globules up to 5 urn across and pharyngeal baskets of ingested microthoracid
ciliates in well-nourished specimens. Glides and swims rather rapidly.
Cilia arranged in an average of 17 equidistant, mostly bipolar, densely ciliated rows abutting
on circumoral kinety in acute (at right side) to almost right angles (at left), as is typical for
272

Spathidium (but see discussion). Dorsal brush rather conspicuous because occupying about
23% of body length and having up to 5 um long bristles; all rows with rather long, mono-
kinetidal portion anteriorly; rather irregular, that is, consisting of three ordinary rows and one
or two additional short rows right of row 1 or between rows 1 to 3. Anterior basal body of
row 1 dikinetids associated with an about 5 um long, distally spherically inflated bristle in
anterior quarter of row; bristles decrease in length and become tongue-shaped posteriorly.
Brush row 2 like row 1, bristles however not tongue-shaped but slightly inflated in posterior
portion of row; continues, like row 1, as an ordinary somatic kinety posteriorly. Brush row 3
anteriorly like row 1, posteriorly with a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to mid-body (Fig.
59a, e,h,k-n; Table 51).
Oral bulge comparatively short, that is, only slightly longer than widest trunk region, but
massive and packed with extrusomes making it conspicuous both in vivo and protargol
preparations, where the oral body portion is axe-shaped in specimens with distinctly narrowed
neck; conspicuously slanting, ventral half occasionally even parallel to main body axis;
elongate elliptical in frontal view. Circumoral kinety also elongate elliptical, but with ventral

Occurrence and ecology: See next chapter.
Generic assignment and comparison with original description and
related species: The dikinetidal fragments comprising the circumoral kinety of 5".
extensum are often not fully aligned, producing a pattern typical for Protospathidium.
However, the general organization, especially the distinct dorsal brush and the massive oral
bulge indicate that the Namibian population belongs to Spathidium.
Spathidium extensum is highly variable in two important features which are usually fairly
constant, viz. the macronuclear pattern and the number of dorsal brush rows (Fig. 59c, i,j;
Table 51). Often, such variability is found in declining cultures or associated with weak
populations. However, the S. extensum culture was in good condition and contained a fairly
high number of individuals as well as some dividers. The latter suggests that S. extensum
basically has scattered macronuclear nodules, and specimens with one or more tortuous
macronuclear strands are post-dividers, as shown in —> Spathidium turgitorum. Possibly, full
post-divisional macronuclear fragmentation needs more time in S. extensum than -» S.
turgitorum, and thus such specimens are more frequent in the population. KAHL (1935) also
mentioned the high variability of the macronucleus.
The most important features of the Namibian specimens, viz., the large size and slender shape
(220 x 30 urn), the short but massive extrusomes (5-6 x 1 urn), and the comparatively short
oral bulge (one sixth of body length) match the description of S. extensum (Fig. 59a, 1), which
KAHL (1933, 1935) discovered in a ditch with sea-water at Sylt, Germany. Later,
VUXANOVICI (1959) reported it from a freshwater lake (Herastrau) in Romania. Both
descriptions are brief and lack reliable details, but KAHL (1933) mentions that the extrusomes
are short (4 urn) and thin, while those of the Namibian specimens are thick. However, thin
and thick are relative if not substantiated by measurements or figures. Thus, it would be
difficult to find reliable differences between the Namibian and German populations at the
present state of knowledge. This is emphasized by the biotopes: a sea-water filled ditch and
highly saline soil from a flooded part of the Etosha Pan. In spite of this, we do not neotypify
the species with the Namibian material because marine spathidiids are so poorly known.
The features listed above, especially the short extrusomes, separate S. extensum from several
similar soil spathidiids, such as S. muscicola KAHL, 1930b, Epispathidium terricola
FOISSNER, 1987b, and E. ascendens, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1987b). The most similar
species are probably —> S. rusticanum (stouter, dorsal brush short) and its relatives, especially
5". anguilla, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1984). Further, all these species have a different oral
infraciliature.
Supraspathidium etoschense nov. spec. (Fig. 60a-j, m, o; 326a-i; Table 52)
Diagnosis: Size about 200 x 70 urn in vivo. Spatulate to bursiform with elliptical, oblique
oral bulge about half as wide as broadest postoral region; unflattened. Macronucleus tortuous
and up to twice as long as cell. Contractile vacuole row right of dorsal brush. Oral bulge
extrusomes elongate clavate, about 7 urn long. On average 44 ciliary rows.
274

Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 18°50'S 16°30'E
(site 67 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the region discovered.
Description: This species is difficult to impregnate because it is large and usually packed
with food inclusions. Thus, the type slides are mediocre, and especially the excretory pores of
the contractile vacuoles are very faintly impregnated. The vacuoles proper, however, are well
recognizable under interference contrast illumination. Accordingly, the occurrence of several
contractile vacuoles in dorsolateral position is recognizable in the type slides.
Size 140-250 x 50-90 urn in vivo, usually near 200 x 70 urn; length:width ratio about 3:1 in
vivo and 2.5:1 in protargol preparations, indicating that specimens became inflated and/or
shrunk considerably during preparation (Table 52). Shape also very variable, obviously
highly dependent on nutrition condition, viz., spatulate, bursiform, elongate bursiform, or
cylindroidal (Fig. 60a, f, g); oral region flattened up to 2:1, postoral portion cylindroidal.
Macronucleus in main body axis and highly tortuous, at least as long as to up to twice as long
as cell, occasionally slightly nodulated. Several micronuclei, exact number difficult to assess
because of many similarly sized and impregnated cell inclusions (Fig. 60a, m; 326a, b). One
large terminal contractile vacuole and three to six small contractile vacuoles, each with
usually several excretory pores, in dorsolateral position, that is, about ten kineties right of
dorsal brush (Fig. 60a, f, o). Extrusomes packed in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, 6-8
urn long, rod-shaped with fusiform subterminal inflation when attached to oral bulge (Fig.
60c, f); inflation almost disappears in preparations (Fig. 326c, e, h) and, in vivo, when
extrusomes become detached from bulge (Fig. 60d; 326g), a peculiar feature observed in
three carefully studied specimens; do not impregnate with protargol, but stain heavily with
silver carbonate and become rod-shaped or elongate cuneate. Many minute rods (1.5-2 urn),
very likely also extrusomes, scattered in oral bulge and cytoplasm, impregnate with silver
carbonate (Fig. 60e; 326c, e, h). Cortex very flexible and rather thick, contains closely spaced
rows of colourless granules (mucocysts ?) about 1 um across (Fig. 60h). Cytoplasm usually
packed with food vacuoles and lipid droplets up to 10 urn across, often colourful due to
ingested, cyanobacteria feeding nassulids and colpodids (e.g., Nassula granata, Kuklikophrya
ougandae). Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Somatic cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, form rather closely spaced, equidistant rows
commencing around circumoral kinety and extending meridionally to posterior body end.
Cilia closely spaced within rows (about 1 urn; Table 52), especially at anterior end, where
short "perioral" fragments are produced. All ciliary rows abut on circumoral kinety, those on
right side in very steep angles, those on left conspicuously curved with anterior portion
directed ventrally (Fig. 60a, j, m; 326c, d, f, h). Three dorsal rows anteriorly differentiated to
an about 45 urn long dorsal brush composed of paired, about 3 urn long, rod-shaped bristles;
row 3 extends to mid-body with about 2 urn long, monokinetidal bristles and then continues,
as the other brush rows usually do, as an ordinary somatic ciliary row (Fig. 60a, i, o; 326i).
Oral area flattened and usually set off from body proper by a slight constriction. Oral bulge
obliquely (about 45°) truncate, oblong and bright in frontal view due to the refractive
extrusomes contained, inconspicuous compared to size of cell because only about 3 um high;
ciliary rows thus extend almost to anterior body end, producing the pattern characteristic for
this kind of spathidiids. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge and thus oblong, composed of
very closely spaced dikinetids (Fig. 60a, b, j, m; 326b, c, d, f, h).

dikinetids (arrowheads). In contrast, the location of the contractile vacuoles, respectively, their excretory pores, is very
different and thus an important distinguishing feature: far right of the brush in S. etoschense, in line with the brush in S.

Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, where it was rather
numerous for some days, especially when nassulids were abundant. The occurrence at site
(58) indicates that it might be a limnetic species.
Comparison with related species: The general appearance and the ciliary pattern
highly resemble Supraspathidium multistriatum FOISSNER & DIDIER, 1981 (Fig. 60k, n, p)7.
There is, however, a conspicuous, unexpected difference, viz., the location of the contractile

278

vacuoles: dorsolateral in S. etoschense (Fig. 60o) and in line with the dorsal brush in S.
multistriatum (Fig. 60p). Furthermore, the extrusomes are slightly different (straight rods with
a subterminal inflation vs. slightly curved rods8; Fig. 60c, d, 1; 326g) and most morpho-
metrics, especially the number of ciliary rows, do not or only slightly overlap because S.
etoschense is considerably smaller than S. multistriatum (Table 52).
The only other species similar to S. etoschense is S. vermiforme (PENARD, 1922) FOISSNER &
DIDIER, 1981, which, however, is flattened leaf-like and loosely ciliated, while S. etoschense
is unflattened and comparatively densely ciliated. Supraspathidium armatum, described
below, differs from S. etoschense by many features, such as body size and shape and
arrangement of the contractile vacuoles.

Supraspathidium armatum nov. spec. (Fig. 61 a—j; Table 52)
Diagnosis: Size about 350 x 35 urn in vivo; elongate lanceolate with distinctly narrowed
posterior region, unflattened. Oral bulge elliptical and oblique, longer by one third than
broadest postoral region. Macronucleus tortuous, about as long as cell, conspicuously
flattened band-like. A row of contractile vacuoles each in ventral and dorsal side. Extrusomes
elongate clavate, about 9 urn long. On average 42 ciliary rows.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of EtoshaPan, Namibia, 18°55'S 16°25'E
(site 65 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective armatum (armed) refers to the conspicuous extrusomes.
Description: This species was very rare. We saw only about 10 individuals, of which
four could be impregnated with protargol (mediocre quality). Accordingly, data are not very
detailed, especially morphometry. However, it was carefully observed in vivo and better
impregnated in the slides from site (54), where, however, the specimens were considerably
smaller and stouter casting doubts on conspecificity (Table 52).
Size 300-400 x 30-40 urn, usually about 350 x 35 urn in vivo; length:width ratio 8.5-12:1,
on average near 10:1. Lanceolate, that is, anteriorly obliquely truncate and gradually
narrowed posteriorly, where it is usually slightly inflated in protargol preparations; laterally
flattened in oral and tail area. Macronucleus in central body portion, highly tortuous and

flattened band-like (Fig. 6Id, e, h; Table 52), a rare feature found also in —> Protospathidiwn
namibicola, albeit less pronounced; contains many minute and rather large nucleoli bulging
nuclear band. Many globular micronuclei which, however, could not be counted because of
similarly sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Many contractile vacuoles in two
rough rows: one row in ventral side slightly left of midline, the other right of dorsal brush
between left and dorsal side; most vacuoles with two or more excretory pores (Fig. 61a, g, j).
Extrusomes packed in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, 8-10 urn long, elongate clavate,
that is, posterior half thicker than anterior bearing minute globule on top (Fig. 61a, b, f); do
not impregnate with protargol. Cortex very flexible, contains about six rows of yellowish,
highly refractive granules (mucocysts ?) between each two ciliary rows (Fig. 61c). Cytoplasm
colourless, usually packed with lipid droplets 1-3 urn across. Feeds on various ciliates, for
instance, Nassula, whose oral basket and extrusomes can be recognized in the food vacuoles.
Swims rapidly, in spite of the large size, showing great flexibility when touching obstacles
and under the cover-glass.
Cilia about 12 urn long, closely spaced, arranged in meridional rows, whose densely ciliated
anterior portion forms steep angles with the circumoral kinety on right side, while left side
ends are curved ventrally; some rows slightly shortened anteriorly or posteriorly (Fig. 61g, i).
Three dorsal ciliary rows anteriorly differentiated to an about 120 urn long dorsal brush
composed of rod-shaped, 3-4 urn long, comparatively widely spaced bristle pairs; row 3
continues with monokinetidal, 2-3 urn long bristles to at least mid-body (Fig. 61a, j; Table
52).
Oral area flattened and usually set off from body proper by a slight constriction. Oral bulge
obliquely (~ 45°) truncate, oblong and, although only 3-4 um high, rather conspicuous due to
the many refractive extrusomes contained. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge and thus
also oblong, its composition of dikinetidal kinetofragments is occasionally well-recognizable
(Fig. 61a, b, g-i).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location and sites nearby, all
very saline habitats, where it was rare in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures.
Comparison with related species: Supraspathidium armatum has so many special
features (body and extrusome shape, two rows of contractile vacuoles, band-like flattened
macronucleus) that it cannot be confused with any other ciliate. However, most morpho-
metrics are highly variable (Table 52).
Arcuospathidium namibiense nov. spec.
Diagnosis: Size about 160 x 10 urn in vivo. Very slenderly cylindroidal with inconspicu-
ous, obliquely truncated, cuneate oral bulge occupying about 6% of body length. Approxi-
mately 20 scattered macronuclear nodules and 2 fusiform micronuclei. Extrusomes oblong or
oblanceolate, about 1 urn long. Usually 4-6 ciliary rows, 2 or 3 anteriorly differentiated to
short, but conspicuous dorsal brush having some 15-20 urn long bristles at anterior end of
row 3; row 1 lacking or consisting of few bristles.
Remarks: We split this species into two subspecies, differing mainly in the shape of the
283

extrusomes (oblanceolate vs. oblong), but also in details of the brush (two vs. three rows) and
the number of ciliary rows (four vs. five).
Generic classification: Arcuospathidium namibiense has so few ciliary rows that
their arrangement in the oral area, which is crucial for generic assignment (FOISSNER 1984), is
difficult to follow. However, if some obviously related species are taken into consideration,
then it becomes likely that the African populations are extreme members of Arcuospathidium,
as defined by FOISSNER (1984). It is possible to construct a series of transitions starting with
A. multinucleatum FOISSNER, 1999b (15 ciliary rows) over A vermiforme FOISSNER, 1984 (11
ciliary rows) to A. namibiense (4-6 ciliary rows).
Comparison with related species (see also —• Protospathidium vermiforme):
Arcuospathidium namibiense differs, inter alia, by the scattered macronuclear nodules from
most described congeners, especially A. vermiforme FOISSNER, 1984 (two macronuclear
nodules), A. cooperi FOISSNER, 1996b (single, reniform macronucleus), and A. vlassaki
FOISSNER, 2000d (single, rod-shaped macronucleus). Only A. multinucleatum FOISSNER,
1999b has the same nuclear pattern as A. namibiense. However, both species are easily
distinguished by body shape (14:1 vs. 7:1 in preparations) and number of ciliary rows (4-6
vs. 11-19).
At first glance, Arcuospathidium namibiense looks like Spathidium bonneti BuiTKAMP
(1977a). However, a more detailed comparison reveals significant differences, although the
description of S. bonneti is brief and lacks detailed morphometrics and data about the
extrusomes. The most important difference concerns the distinctly elongated (15-20 um!) and
thus highly characteristic bristles at top of brush row 3. These bristles and their basal bodies
are so distinct in vivo and protargol preparations that one cannot assume that BuiTKAMP
(1977a) overlooked them. A further main difference is the body's length:width ratio, which is
30:1 in S. bonneti, according to BuiTKAMP's description and illustration (Fig. 63o). In A.
namibiense namibiense and A. namibiense tristicha, only two of 42 specimens analyzed have
a ratio of 24:1, while the average values are much lower, viz., 13.7:1 and 15.1:1 (Table 53).
The third main difference concerns the location of the single dikinetid composing brush row 1
(Fig. 63n, q): distinctly underneath the circumoral kinety in S. bonneti, while close to the
circumoral kinety in A. namibiense tristicha. Finally, the location of the contractile vacuole
(distinctly subterminal vs. terminal) and body shape (distinctly vs. slightly narrowed
posteriorly) are slightly different.'
In vivo, A. namibiense is rather similar to Spathidium procerum KAHL, 1930a, as redescribed
by FOISSNER (1984). However, this species is a "true" Spathidium, has up to 10 urn long, rod-
shaped extrusomes, lacks elongated dorsal bristles, and possesses 10 ciliary rows. As
concerns the elongated dorsal bristles, A. namibiense resembles S. falciforme PENARD, 1922,
which, however, is only 40-60 urn long.
In vivo, A. namibiense is indistinguishable from —» Protospathidium vermiforme. Thus,
' We discussed the problem with Dr. BUITKAMP, whose slides of Spathidium bonneti are, unfortunately,
completely bleached. In his letter, BUITKAMP stated: (i) My prepared specimens have a similar size as yours, but
I remember that they were distinctly narrower in vivo; (ii) With interference contrast, I could recognize in two
specimens at least one 15 urn long dorsal bristle, which I obviously overlooked previously, but the whole dorsal
brush pattern seems to be distinctly different in S. bonneti and A. namibiense; (iii) I believe that S. bonneti and
A. namibiense are different species.

protargol impregnation is required to reveal the structure of the circumoral kinety (FOISSNER
1984): composed of a single line distinctly set off from the ciliary rows (Fig. 63j, p, q) vs.
short fragments attached to the ciliary rows (Fig. 69f-j).
Arcuospathidium namibiense namibiense nov. sspec. (Fig. 62a-i; Table 53)
Diagnosis: Extrusomes oblong. 4-5 ciliary rows, 2 anteriorly modified to brush.
Type location: Soil from Aloe dichotoma forest near the Gariganus Guest Farm,
Namibia, 26°30'S 18°25'E (site 5 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size highly variable, in vivo 110-210 x 8-15 urn, usually about 160 x 12
urn; length:width ratio also highly variable, that is, 9:1 - 24:1, on average 14:1 in prepara-
tions (Table 53). Cylindroidal to slightly fusiform, frequently strongly curved or sigmoidal
and slightly twisted about main body axis, rather distinctly flattened laterally (Fig. 62a, h);
acontractile and rather fragile, specimens thus sometimes distorted and/or inflated in
protargol preparations. Nuclear apparatus in middle quarters of cell on average (Fig. 62a, h).
Macronuclear nodules basically scattered with a tendency to form a cluster each in second
and third quarter of cell; rarely in series or single accumulation near body centre; individual
nodules globular to elongate ellipsoidal, on average ellipsoidal, usually contain one or two
large nucleoli; unite to a globular mass in middle dividers. Usually two micronuclei, one each
in anterior and posterior third of nuclear figure; individual micronuclei conspicuous because
ellipsoidal, fusiform or slenderly ovate and about 4x2 urn in size, that is, almost as large as
macronuclear nodules; micronuclei lacking or not clearly recognizable in about one third of
specimens due to similarly sized and shaped cell inclusions. Contractile vacuole in rear body
end, some subterminal excretory pores on ventral side. Extrusomes in oral bulge, oblong,
extremely minute, that is, 1-1.2 um long; do not impregnate with the protargol method used
(Fig. 62a, c). Cortex very flexible, thin, contains inconspicuous rows of loosely spaced,
colourless granules less than 0.5 urn across. Cytoplasm hyaline, contains some bright lipid
droplets 1-2 urn across and about 5 [im-sized food vacuoles each containing only one or two
bacterial rods. Slowly gliding and wriggling like an eel, showing great flexibility when
creeping among soil particles.
Cilia about 7 urn long in vivo^ invariably arranged in four or five, usually four slightly
spiralling, equidistant rows; distances between individual cilia about 4 urn to up to 6 urn in
longest specimens, ciliature thus loose; as is usual in haptorid gymnostomes, barren basal
bodies may occur near ciliated ones. All ciliary rows abut on circumoral kinety, except for
one or two (in specimens with five rows) anteriorly distinctly shortened right side rows.
Brush conspicuous, although occupying only 10% of body length, because of its long bristles
easily recognizable even at low magnification (> xlOO)10. Dorsal brush row 2 composed of an
10 Brush row 1 is lacking, compared with A. namibiense tristicha, where it is present but consists of only one or
few kinetids. To make morphometrics comparable, we consider the first (right) brush row of A. namibiense
namibiense as row 2.

average of seven dikinetids bearing about 5 urn long bristles, usually separated from
circumoral kinety by a single monokinetid, continues as ordinary somatic ciliary row
posteriorly. Brush row 3 anteriorly with two to four closely spaced, about 15 urn long and
thus highly conspicuous, rod-shaped bristles obliquely spread posteriorly in gliding and
swimming specimens; large bristles followed by an average of five dikinetids having about 5
urn long bristles; then likely continues with a few 2-3 urn long monokinetidal bristles before
extending backwards as ordinary somatic kinety (Fig. 62a, e-i; Table 53).
Oral bulge about 3 urn high in vivo, minute because slightly narrower than widest postoral
body region and occupying only about 6% of body length; slanted approximately 50° to main
body axis, slenderly obovate or cuneate in frontal view, contains the minute extrusomes
described above. Circumoral kinety composed of comparatively widely spaced dikinetids,
each bearing a single cilium and a fibre extending into the oral bulge. Oral basket (rods) not
recognizable in vivo or protargol preparations, not even in over-stained specimens (Fig. 62a,
d, e-i; Table 53).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rather
abundant. This species is well-adapted to the sandy habitat by its slender body.

three dorsal brush rows.
288

Description: Size highly variable, that is, 110-190 x 6-12 um in vivo, usually about 150
x 9 urn; length:width ratio also highly variable, that is, 11-24:1, on average 15.2:1 in
preparations (Table 53). Cylindroidal to slightly fusiform or club-shaped, usually strongly
curved or sigmoidal and distinctly twisted about main body axis, flattened only in anterior
region; when gliding, anterior body half often straight, posterior more or less distinctly
curved, providing cells with a characteristic L-shaped appearance; rarely, coiled specimens
occur (Fig. 63a-c, r, t-v). Nuclear apparatus in middle and anterior half of last third of cell on
average (Fig. 63a, 1). Macronuclear nodules basically scattered with a tendency to form a
cluster each in anterior and posterior end of nuclear figure; rarely in series or distinct clusters
in anterior and posterior body half; individual nodules globular to elongate ellipsoidal, on
average broadly ellipsoidal, usually contain some small nucleoli. Invariably two micronuclei,
one each in anterior and posterior third of nuclear figure; individual micronuclei conspicuous
because elongate ellipsoidal or fusiform and about 5x2 urn in size, that is, almost as long as
macronuclear nodules. Contractile vacuole in rear end, some subterminal excretory pores on
ventral side. Extrusomes in both sides of oral bulge, distinctly oblanceolate, extremely
minute, that is, 1-1.2 x 0.5 um; impregnate with the protargol method used and then resemble
basal bodies (Fig. 63a, d, g, j, s; 327b-d). Cortex very flexible, thin, contains five to six rows
of colourless, minute (< 0.5 urn) granules between each two ciliary rows. Cytoplasm hyaline,
contains some bright lipid droplets 1-3 urn across and up to 12 um-sized food vacuoles, once
with an almost intact Cyrtolophosis mucicola. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide,
wriggling like an eel when creeping among soil particles.
Cilia about 7 urn long in vivo, invariably arranged in five to six, usually five distinctly
spiralling, equidistant rows, distances between individual cilia 2-4 urn, ciliature thus
moderately dense. All ciliary rows abut on circumoral kinety, except one or two (in speci-
mens with six rows) anteriorly distinctly shortened right side rows (Fig. 63a, i-1, p, q; Table
53). Brush conspicuous, although occupying only 11% of body length, because of its long
bristles, already recognizable at low magnification (> xlOO). Brush row 1 consists of one to
three, usually only one dikinetid separated from circumoral kinety by a single monokinetid;
lacking in one out of 25 specimens investigated. Brush row 2 about 15 (am long in vivo,
separated from circumoral kinety by a single monokinetid, continues as ordinary somatic
kinety posteriorly, composed of an average of 15 closely spaced dikinetids having up to 10
urn long bristles gradually decreasing in length at row ends; anterior bristles of dikinetids
longer than posterior and slightly inflated distally. Brush row 3 about 10 um long in vivo,
anteriorly with some very closely spaced, 15-20 urn long and thus highly conspicuous, rod-
shaped bristles obliquely spread backwards in gliding and swimming specimens (Fig. 327a);
composed of an average- of seven -dikinetids -having .up Jo 6 um long-bristles_gradually
decreasing in length at row ends; anterior bristles of dikinetids longer than posterior and
slightly inflated distally; row then continues with some 2-3 urn long, monokinetidal bristles
before extending as an ordinary somatic kinety backwards (Fig. 63a, i-1, m, q; Table 53).
Oral bulge up to 4 urn high in vivo and thus rather conspicuous, although slightly narrower
than widest postoral region and occupying only about 6% of body length, slanted 40-60° to
main body axis, slenderly obovate in frontal view, contains the minute extrusomes described
above. Circumoral kinety composed of rather closely spaced dikinetids each bearing an about
7 urn long cilium. Oral basket (rods) not recognizable in vivo or protargol preparations, not
even in over-stained specimens (Fig. 63a, d-f, i-1, p, q).

Observations on other populations: This species is rather frequent in soils from
Africa and possibly also South America (Fig. 327f-i). A rather weak population from Benin
(soil sample from the farm of the Agricultural Faculty at the National University in the town
of Abomey; kindly provided by Prof. Jean DRAGESCO) was studied in some detail (Fig. 63r-
v). It matches the Namibian site (5) population well, especially in having long (about 13 urn
as opposed to 7 urn long somatic cilia) bristles at anterior end of brush row 3 and minute,
oblanceolate extrusomes which, however, do not impregnate with protargol. The macro-
nucleus is more frequently indistinctly moniliform than in the Namibian specimens. Brush
row 1 is lacking in about 20% of specimens and usually consists of three to six dikinetids in
291

the others, while rows 2 and 3 have only about half the number of dikinetids found in the
Namibian specimens. Obviously, A. namibiense tristicha is rather variable in brush details,
while the extrusomes are highly similar in the about 20 populations checked so far.
Occurrence and ecology: Found at various sites in Namibia (Table 4) and South
Africa. Possibly also occurs in Venezuela. The species, which is well-adapted to soil life by
its worm-like body, became abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish culture from the type
location; usually, however, numbers are low.
Arcuospathidium etoschense nov. spec. (Fig. 64a-m; 332i; Table 54)
Diagnosis: Size about 190 x 15 urn in vivo. Very slenderly cylindroidal with compara-
tively conspicuous, strongly slanted oral bulge occupying about 16% of body length. On
average 11 elongate ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules in series and 4 fusiform to elongate
ovate micronuclei. Extrusomes slenderly cuneate, about 4 urn long. About 10 ciliary rows, 3
anteriorly differentiated to moderately distinct dorsal brush.
Type location: Highly saline swamp soil from around the Okerfontein water-hole in the
Etosha National Park, Namibia, 18°45'S 16°45'E (site 69 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the region discovered.
Description: Unfortunately, this species did not impregnate well, and thus we cannot
provide detailed data on the infraciliature. Usually, we do not describe such material, but this
species has several distinct features making re-identification likely.
Size 140-250 x 10-25 urn in vivo, usually near 190 x 15 urn, length:width ratio also highly
variable, that is, 7.4-22:1, on average 13.7:1 in vivo and protargol preparations. Body
cylindroidal, rarely curved worm-like, oral and neck region flattened up to 2:1 laterally;
acontractile and fairly robust (Fig. 64a, g, i, k, 1; Table 54). Nuclear apparatus in middle
quarters of cell (Fig. 64a, i, k, 1). Macronucleus basically nodular; a long strand or a mixture
of nodules and more or less long pieces occur, however, in early and late post-dividers (Fig.
64m), as explained in —> Spathidium turgitorum. Individual macronuclear nodules in series
with a tendency to form a cluster each anteriorly and posteriorly; globular to very elongate
ellipsoidal, on average 11x4 um in protargol preparations, contain many minute nucleoli. On
average four fusiform, elongate ovate or reniform micronuclei near macronuclear nodules,
difficult to recognize in vivo and only lightly impregnated with protargol. Contractile vacuole
in posterior body end. Extrusomes in single, rough row in oral bulge and scattered in
cytoplasm, difficult to recognize in vivo because of similar refractivity as cytoplasm;
individual extrusomes slenderly cuneate and 3-4 urn long both in vivo and protargol
preparations, where the posterior third impregnates heavily, while the anterior thirds
impregnate lightly; exploded toxicysts obclavate and hyaline, up to 10 urn long (Fig. 64a, c-f,
h-m; 332i). Cortex very flexible, contains closely spaced rows of minute (~ 0.2 mm)
granules, which impregnate deeply and hide the ciliary pattern. Cytoplasm hyaline, contains
some bright lipid droplets up to 2 um across. Food not observed, likely small ciliates. Glides
and swims rather rapidly showing great flexibility when creeping between soil particles.
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, arranged in about ten equidistant rows, distances between individual

b Approximations because of poor preparation.
cilia rather wide; three ciliary rows anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush with longest row 2
slightly shorter than oral bulge, row 3 with a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to second
third of body. Brush bristles about 4 urn long and distally slightly inflated in all rows (Fig.
64a, b, i, m; Table 54).
Oral bulge rather conspicuous because occupying 16% of body length on average, distinctly
set off from body proper and so strongly slanted that it becomes orientated almost in parallel
with main body axis; cuneate and about 4 \im wide in ventral view, 3-4 urn high in lateral
view, contains a single, rough row of extrusomes producing a small bundle in broadened
anterior end. Circumoral kinety continuous, associated with very fine nematodesmata forming
long, faintly impregnated basket (Fig. 64a, g-m; Table 54).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in saline soil of the Etosha National
Park (Table 4), indicating that it is a euryhaline species. Arcuospathidium etoschense is well
adapted to soil life by its slender body.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: The
generic classification remains somewhat doubtful because the ciliary pattern could not be
seen clearly, except for the circumoral kinety, which is continuous. Thus, the population
belongs either to Spathidium or Arcuospathidium. Fortunately, the species highly resembles
A. vlassaki FOISSNER, 2000d and thus likely belongs to this genus. Actually, A. etoschense
differs from A. vlassaki only by one main feature, viz., the macronucleus which is nodular in
the former and a long strand in the latter. Minor differences occur in body shape (length:width
ratio 13:1 vs. 10:1), the extrusomes (slenderly cuneate vs. obovate), and the oral bulge, which
294

is longer and more distinct than in A. vlassaki. Other Arcuospathidium species either also
have a different macronuclear pattern or long dorsal bristles (—> A. namibiense). Several
Spathidium species are also rather similar, especially —> Spathidium turgitorum (extrusomes
rod-shaped, more than 40 scattered macronuclear nodules); S. procerum, as redescribed by
FOISSNER 1984 (extrusomes rod-shaped, single macronuclear strand); S. metabolicum POMP &
WILBERT, 1988 (oral bulge much less slanted and with three rows of elongate oval extru-
somes); and S. anguilla, as redescribed by FOISSNER 1984 (oral bulge with many scattered,
fusiform extrusomes, 26 macronuclear nodules, micronuclei globular).
Arcuospathidium etoschense and A. vlassaki, both discovered in highly saline soils of the
Etosha National Park, are only the tip of an iceberg because we discovered two further new
species of this type in highly saline soils of the northern Namib Desert. A specific and highly
characteristic feature of these spathidiids are the slender micronuclei.
Arcuospathidium lorjeae nov. spec. (Fig. 65a-m; 328a-c, f; Table 55)
Diagnosis: Size about 200 x 18 urn in vivo. Slenderly spatulate with distinctly oblique,
slenderly dumb-bell-shaped oral bulge occupying approximately 1/3 of body length.
Macronucleus vermiform, tortuous. Extrusomes about 6 x 0.5 urn, slightly fusiform. On
average 17 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly modified to conspicuous dorsal brush having up to 10
urn long bristles and occupying 31% of body length.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Dedication: Sabine AGATHA dedicates this species to her teacher and friend, Dr.
Jeannette Cornelie RIEDEL-LORJE, Hamburg.
Description: Size 150-250 x 10-25 urn in vivo, usually near 200 x 18 urn; length:width
ratio 8.4-16.1:1, on average about 11:1 in vivo and protargol preparations (Table 55).
Slenderly spatulate to almost rod-shaped because of the steep, hardly projecting oral bulge
and the cylindroidal postoral portion; oral area, that is, anterior body third more or less
distinctly curved dorsally and laterally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 65a, b, h-k; 328a). Macro-
nucleus in central body portion, vermiform and up to 2:1 flattened, more or less distinctly
nodular and tortuous; nucleoli minute, numerous. On average 13 globular micronuclei
attached and near macronucleus. Contractile vacuole in rear end, about six excretory pores in
posterior pole area. Extrusomes in an indistinct row each right and left of oral bulge midline
and scattered in cytoplasm, do not impregnate with the protargol method used, except for a
certain cytoplasmic developmental stage; individual extrusomes slightly fusiform because of
inconspicuously narrowed and rounded ends, about 6 x 0.5 urn in size (Fig. 65b, e; 328b).
Cortex flexible, conspicuous because containing narrowly spaced rows of highly refractive
granules about 1 x 0.5 urn in size (Fig. 65f, g). Cytoplasm colourless and hyaline, especially
in oral area, contains few to many lipid droplets up to 10 urn across. Food not known, likely
other ciliates. Swims and glides rather rapidly showing great flexibility.
Cilia about 8 (im long in vivo, widely spaced in oral area, arranged in an average of 17
equidistant rows anteriorly directed dorsally at both sides of circumoral kinety, as typical for
the genus (FOISSNER 1984). Three dorsal ciliary rows anteriorly differentiated to conspicuous
295

dorsal brush occupying on average 31%
B1 B2 B3
of body length; brush bristles about 10 urn
long in middle region becoming smaller
anteriorly and posteriorly, up to twice as
thick as ordinary somatic cilia and thus
forming a jelly mass with details diffi-
cult to recognize both in vivo and the
scanning electron microscope; distal
bristle end becomes inflated on pro-
longed observation (Fig. 65a, c; 328c, f;
Table 55). Brush row 1 slightly shorter
than row 2, composed of an average of
34 moderately widely spaced dikinetids
with anterior bristles only half as long as
posterior; row 2 similar to row 1, but com-
posed of an average of 53 very narrowly
spaced dikinetids; dikinetidal portion of
brush row 3 distinctly shorter than row 2,
composed of an average of 24 comparati-
vely widely spaced dikinetids with posterior
bristles about half as long as anterior, has
a long, monokinetidal tail made of 1 urn
long bristles.
Oral area more or less distinctly curved
dorsally and flattened up to 2:1. Oral
bulge occupies one third of body length
on average, inconspicuous because only
about 3 urn wide and high and thus in-
distinctly set off from body proper, steep
to very steep, that is, extends almost
parallel to main body axis; in frontal view
very elongate dumb-bell-shaped with
tapered anterior and narrowly rounded

-> Arcuospathidium cultriforme-convplex described below. Within this complex, it is most
similar to Arcuospathidium cultriforme cultriforme, differing distinctly, however, in the
length:width ratio (11.4:1 vs. 6.9:1), the number of ciliary rows (17 vs. 28) and, especially,
the length of the dorsal bristles (up to 10 urn vs. up to 5 urn; Fig. 328d-f). It is the last
feature, which makes the species so conspicuous.
Arcuospathidium cultriforme (PENARD, 1922) FOISSNER, 1984
Improved diagnosis: Size about 180-300 x 20-60 urn in vivo, usually near 230-280 x
30-40 urn. Spatulate to knife-shaped with distinctly oblique, slenderly cuneate to elliptical
oral bulge occupying 1/3 to 2/3 of body length. Macronucleus vermiform, tortuous. Extru-
somes 4-8 x 0.6—1 urn, rod-shaped to indistinctly fusiform or acicular. On average 28-32
ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush occupying 27-36% of body length.
Remarks: We split this species into three subspecies mainly differing in the relative length
of the mouth, which is an important morphometric feature causing a rather different overall
appearance (Fig. 66a-f): A. cultriforme cultriforme (ACC; mouth one third of body length);
A. cultriforme lionotiforme (ACL; mouth about half of body length); and A. cultriforme
megastoma (ACM; mouth about two thirds of body length). There are also differences in
some other features, such as details of body and extrusome shape, body size, and number of
ciliary rows. However, all these differences are inconspicuous and likely within the range of
the species' natural variability. Thus, we distinguish the subspecies only according to the
relative mouth length at the present state of knowledge. This is also supported by the
coefficients of divergence, reported in the next paragraph.
We calculated the "coefficient of divergence" for two main features of the three populations,
according to the simple advice of MAYR (1975), using the redescriptions and original data of
FOISSNER (1984). The coefficient of divergence is D = (xb-xa)/(sa+sb), where (a) and (b)
are the arithmetic means and (s) the standard deviations of the features to be compared. If the
coefficient is < 1.28, subspecies are difficult to separate; if it is near 1.28, subspecies can be
separated by 90% likelihood; and if it is > 1.3, the populations are likely different species
(MAYR 1975).
The following coefficients are obtained for the feature "ratio of body/mouth length": D (ACC
+ ACL) = 1.3; D (ACM + ACC) = 2.3; D (ACM + ACL) = 1.8. The feature "number of
ciliary rows" provides the following coefficients: 1.8; 0.5; 0.5. Accordingly, A. cultriforme
and A lionotiforme are distinct subspecies, while A megastoma seems to be a distinct species
when the mouth length is considered. However, the number of ciliary rows does not separate
A. megastoma from A. cultriforme, whereas A. cultriforme and A. lionotiforme are separated
at subspecies level at least.

Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Apposite noun of the Greek prefix mega (very large) and the Greek noun
stoma (mouth), referring to the extraordinarily large mouth.
Description: Size 180-300 x 20-45 um in vivo, usually near 250 x 30 urn; length:width
ratio 6.2-9.6:1, on average 8.8:1 in protargol preparations, and thus slightly more slender than
A. cultriforme cultriforme and A. cultriforme lionotiforme (both about 7:1, FOISSNER 1984).
Knife-shaped to indistinctly spatulate with anterior body region more or less distinctly curved
dorsally; flattened only in anterior half (Fig. 66e-g; Table 55). Macronucleus in posterior
body half, vermiform and tortuous, about 90 urn long. Micronuclei attached and near
macronucleus, about 3 urn across in vivo, that is, small as compared to body and macro-
nucleus size (Fig. 66e, g). Contractile vacuole in rear end, several excretory pores in posterior
pole area. Extrusomes in a row each right and left of midline of oral bulge, basically rod-
shaped with slightly narrowed and rounded ends, making them indistinctly fusiform or
acicular, 5-7 x 0.6-0.8 urn, that is, rather thick and highly refractive, impregnate occasionally
with protargol (Fig. 66i, 1, m; 328h); immature cytoplasmic extrusomes distinctly fusiform,
impregnate black. Cytoplasm colourless, in some specimens packed with fat globules and
food vacuoles up to 10 urn across and about 8 um long pharyngeal baskets of prey ciliates;
none of the 15 specimen seen, contained large prey. Creeps vividly on microscope slide
curving mouth area to and fro.
Densely ciliated, except in anterior third. On average 30 ciliary rows most distinctly curved
dorsally at both sides of oral bulge and abutting successively to the long circumoral kinety, as
typical for the genus (FOISSNER 1984); three dorsal rows anteriorly differentiated to a long
brush with up to 5 urn long bristles, a minute fourth row composed of only 3-5 dikinetids
right of row 1 in about half of specimens, likely vestiges from patterning of rows 1-3, which
frequently have some irregularities, such as a short overlapping or non-overlapping break
(Fig. 66e, g, h, j, m; Table 55). Brush row 1 slightly shorter than row 2, composed of an
300

average of 52 dikinetids; brush row 2 longer than brush row 3 by about one third, composed
of an average of 80 dikinetids slightly more narrowly spaced than those of row 1; brush row 3
composed of an average of 33 dikinetids more widely spaced than those of rows 1 and 2.
Oral bulge conspicuous because bright due to the thick extrusomes contained and its enor-
mous length, that is, occupying almost 60% of body length on average, straight to distinctly
curved, depending on the state of the anterior body third; only 5 urn wide and 2-3 urn high,
and thus indistinctly set off from body proper. Circumoral kinety very narrowly elliptical, not
widened anteriorly, composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids associated with very fine nemato-
desmata producing a narrow, somewhat branched bundle along oral bulge (Fig. 66e-m).

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location. It was rare in the non-
flooded Petri dish culture. The slender shape indicates that it prefers terrestrial habitats as do
the other subspecies. All subspecies prefer, or are even confined to terrestrial habitats,
especially mosses and leaf litter.
Arcuospathidium novaki nov. spec. (Fig. 67a-k; Table 56)
Diagnosis: Size about 270 x 55 urn in vivo. Spatulate with oblique, cuneate oral bulge
about as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus vermiform and tortuous. Oral bulge
extrusomes acicular, about 7 x 0.8 urn; body extrusomes attached to entire somatic cortex,
rod-shaped, approximately 4 x 0.3 urn. About 20 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly modified to
inconspicuous dorsal brush.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Dedication: We dedicate this species to Dr. Rudolf NOVAK, scientific manager of the
Austrian Science Foundation.
Description: This large ciliate was rare and the few cells found in the protargol slides
were poorly impregnated. Thus, data are incomplete. In spite of this, we describe and name
the population because it has several outstanding features facilitating identification and
contributing to the general morphology of the spathidiids.
Size conspicuous, that is, 200-350 x 40-70 urn in vivo, usually near 270 x 55 urn;
length:width ratio about 5:1 in vivo, while 2.3-5.9:1, on average 3.8:1 in protargol prepara-
tions, indicating some inflation during preparation (Table 56). Shape inconspicuous, that is,
spatulate with distinctly oblique oral bulge occupying 1/4-1/5 of body length; acontractile.
Oral area hyaline because flattened approximately 3:1, oral and body extrusomes thus
distinct; postoral region fusiform and dark at low magnification (< xlOO) due to numerous
cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 67a, b, i). Macronucleus in central quarters of cell, vermiform
and highly tortuous, when spread about as long as body. Many micronuclei difficult to
distinguish from similar-sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole in
rear end; no second contractile vacuole. Extrusomes highly remarkable because a special type
each-in-oral-bulge and somatic cortex-(Fig. 67a,d^-g,h, j, k). Oral-bulge-extrusomes-form a
rough row each in right and left half of oral bulge, acicular, about 7 x 0.8 jam in vivo,
compact and thus highly refractive, do not impregnate with protargol. Body extrusomes
randomly attached to somatic cortex, lacking in oral bulge, rod-shaped, 3-4 x 0.3 urn in vivo,
difficult to recognize, except in hyaline oral area; when extruded, occasionally impregnate
with protargol showing a dark, thick posterior half and a brownish, thin anterior half with a
minute globule at top. Cortex very flexible, contains about 15 rows of minute (~ 0.2 urn)
granules between two kineties each and extrusomes, as described above, appearing as bright
dots among the pale granules (Fig. 67k). Cytoplasm colourless, usually packed with globular
and irregular, highly refractive fat inclusions up to 30 um across. Feeds on ciliates, for
instance, Colpoda minima, recognizable in a food vacuole 90 x 55 urn in size. Glides and
swims slowly showing great flexibility.

Cilia 10 um long and ordinarily spaced in vivo, arranged in about 20 widely spaced rows,
three anteriorly modified to an about 70 urn long, ordinary dorsal brush with up to 4 urn long,
rod-shaped bristles. Brush dikinetids more closely spaced in rows 1 and 2 than in row 3,
which is also distinctly shorter, but has a monokinetidal tail of 1 urn long bristles extending to
second third of cell (Fig. 67a, d).
Oral bulge about 60 urn long in vivo and 5 urn high at dorsal end, distinctly oblique and
slightly convex, cuneate to slenderly cuneate in frontal view, covered by oblique rows of
cortical granules. Circumoral kinety conspicuously cuneate, composed of narrowly spaced
dikinetids, distinctly separate from somatic ciliary rows. Oral basket voluminous.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rare in
the non-flooded Petri dish culture. The large size indicates that it is a limnetic species.
Comparison with related species: Arcuospathidium novaki has several out-
standing features, viz., body (somatic) extrusomes (toxicysts) and, in spite of the huge size,
only about 20 ciliary rows. Thus, it is easily distinguished from all other Spathidium s.l.
species, except of —» Apospathidium spp., which also have body extrusomes and few ciliary
rows. However, —> Apospathidium terricola and —> A. atypicum are smaller (< 200 jam) and
tail-like narrowed posteriorly, and have a short, rod-shaped macronucleus.
The generic classification of this population is somewhat uncertain because the ciliary pattern
is poorly impregnated. However, the cuneate oral bulge and the continuous circumoral kinety
exclude Apospathidium and suggest that it belongs to Arcuospathidium.

Protospathidium namibicola nov. spec. (Fig. 68a-n; 330d-h; Table 57)
Diagnosis: Size about 210 x 20 urn in vivo. Elongate claviform with conspicuous,
hemispherical oral bulge about half as wide as broadest body region. Macronucleus in middle
and posterior body third, frequently flattened band-like and tortuous. Extrusomes rod-shaped,
305

about 5 um long. On average 9 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differentiated to inconspicuous
dorsal brush occupying 10% of body length.
Type location: Dune soil (sand) in the Central Namib Escarpment, north of the village
of Solitaire, Namibia, 23°50'S 16°E (site 33 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin namibicola (inhabiting the Namib Desert) refers to the habitat
(Namib Desert) the species was discovered.
Description: Sizel50-280 x 10-30 urn in vivo, usually about 210x20 urn, length:width
ratio also highly variable, viz., 6.2-19.2:1, on average near 11:1 (Table 57); unflattened and
acontractile. Shape basically elongate claviform gradually broadening posteriorly, widest
region in or below mid-body, both ends narrowly rounded (Fig. 68a, d, i; 330d); slenderest
specimens rod-shaped, broadest ordinarily claviform (Fig. 68f, g); more or less distinctly
inflated immediately after ingesting large prey ciliates. Macronucleus invariably a long,
tortuous strand usually commencing in second third of body and extending to near body end;
flattened band-like and/or more or less distinctly spiralized in about 70% of specimens;
nucleoli globular, small; condenses to a globular mass in middle dividers. Many ellipsoidal
micronuclei along macronucleus, difficult to identify because of similarly sized and impreg-
nated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole in rear body end, on average five excretory
pores on left posterior pole area. Extrusomes packed in oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm,
posterior third occasionally impregnates with protargol; individual extrusomes rod-shaped
with rounded ends, about 5 urn long (Fig. 68a, c, e). Cortex very flexible, contains about eight
rows of minute (< 0.4 jam), colourless granules between each two ciliary rows (Fig. 68h).
Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to many fat globules up to 5 urn across and remnants of
prey ciliates, such as oral baskets and cytoplasmic crystals. Feeds on small (Leptopharynx
costatus, Pseudochilodonopsis mutabilis) and medium-sized {Gonostomum affine) ciliates
ingested whole because still identifiable in young food vacuoles; some specimens contained
five to ten only partially digested prey ciliates, showing that P. namibicola is an effective
predator. Glides and swims slowly, often appearing vermiform due to the strong flexibility
and curved anterior body half (Fig. 68d).
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, arranged in an average of nine equidistant, mostly bipolar
rows connected with the circumoral kinetofragments and rather loosely ciliated in cylin-
droidal neck region (Fig. 68a, i, j; Table 57). Dorsal brush three-rowed, inconspicuous
because occupying only 10% of body length and bristles merely up to 4 urn long; brush
region soft because occasionally slightly inflated in protargol preparations. All brush rows
have a rather long anterior tail composed of closely spaced, ordinary cilia and continue as
somatic kineties posteriorly; row 1 composed of thirteen, row 2 of seventeen, and row 3 often
dikinetids on average, each having a distally inflated, 3-4 jam long anterior bristle and a 2-3
urn long posterior bristle (Fig. 68a, b, 1, n; 330h; Table 57).
Oral bulge conspicuous in vivo, although only half as wide as broadest body region, because
hemispherical and up to 6 urn high when cell is viewed ventrally, appears as a distinct button
at low and middle magnifications (Fig. 68a, d, f; 330e, f); obovate in frontal view and bright
due to the extrusomes contained (Fig. 68c, m; 330f, g). Circumoral kinety at base of oral
bulge, composed of dikinetidal kinetofragments attached to the somatic ciliary rows and
separated from each other by gaps one to three dikinetids wide; individual kinetofragments
composed of six to twelve zigzagging basal bodies, dikinetidal organization clearly recogniz-
able only in strongly impregnated cells. Each dikinetid associated with a rather thick fibre

spiralling to bulge centre, and a short nematodesma contributing to the inconspicuous oral
basket (Fig. 68a, i-n; 330e-g).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was
abundant, indicating a high prey density not only in the non-flooded Petri dish culture, but
also under natural conditions. Protospathidium namibicola is well adapted to the sandy
habitat by its slender, flexible body.
Comparison with related species: Protospathidium namibicola has a clear
identity and cannot be confused with P. muscicola (Fig. 50s, t) or —> P. vermiforme, which
308

are smaller (< 150 um on average) and have scattered macronuclear nodules and a distinctly
reduced brush row 1; furthermore, —» P. vermiforme is often narrowed tail-like posteriorly.
Generally, however, care must be taken not to confuse P. namibicola with other slender
spathidiids, for instance, —> Arcuospathidium namibiense (brush with up to 15 urn long cilia,
scattered macronuclear nodules) and Spathidium bonneti (scattered macronuclear nodules,
brush row 1 reduced to a single dikinetid; Fig. 63n, o). Furthermore, there are some slender
Enchelyodon species, for instance —» E. armatides, which look fairly similar due to the
button-shaped oral bulge.

Protospathidium vermiforme nov. spec. (Fig. 69a-j)
1981 Protospathidium bonneti nov. comb. (BUITKAMP, 1977) — FOISSNER, Zool. Jb. Syst., 108: 271
(misidentification).
1986 Protospathidium bonneti (BUITKAMP, 1977) — DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS, Faune Tropicale,
26: 156 (revision).
Diagnosis: Size 80-160 x 5-13 urn in vivo. Rod-shaped with inconspicuous, obliquely
truncated oral bulge. About 15 macronuclear nodules and 8 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly
differentiated to conspicuous dorsal brush having about 8 urn long bristles.
Type location: Grassland soil from the surroundings of the "Wallack-Haus" at the
Grossglockner-Hochalpenstrasse, Carinthia, Austria, 47°N 12°50'E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective vermiforme (worm-like) refers to the worm-like shape.
Description and comparison with related species: For description, see
FOISSNER (1981b) and figures 69a-j. The species needs redescription to obtain detailed
information on extrusomes and morphometrics. In vivo, P. vermiforme is indistinguishable
from -» Arcuospathidium namibiense and Spathidium bonneti BUITKAMP, 1977a. Thus,
protargol impregnation is required to reveal the structure of the circumoral kinety (FOISSNER
1984): composed of a single line of dikinetids in Spathidium and Arcuospathidium vs. short,
dikinetidal fragments attached to the ciliary rows in Protospathidium (Fig. 69f-j). As
concerns the congeners, only P. serpens is similar to P. vermiforme. However, P. serpens is
distinctly stouter (< 6:1 vs. > 10:1) and has a tortuous, moniliform macronucleus (FOISSNER
1981b, 1996a).
Remarks: FOISSNER (1981b) redescribed Spathidium bonneti BUITKAMP, 1977a from soil
of the Austrian Central Alps and transferred it to Protospathidium, assuming that BUITKAMP
overlooked the protospathidiid circumoral kinety fragments in his population from the Ivory
Coast (Fig. 63n, o). However, DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS doubted FOISSNER'S
identification and suggested that the Austrian population is a new species and BUITKAMP'S
species the representative of a new genus. As concerns the species, we fully agree with
DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS because we learned that there are quite a lot of slender
spathidiids in soil, some of which have, like BUITKAMP'S species, a "closed" circumoral
kinety, for instance, —» Arcuospathidium namibiense. Comparing the figures of Proto-
spathidium vermiforme (Fig. 69a-c) with that of Spathidium bonneti (Fig. 63o), FOISSNER's
misidentification appears understandable. Such mistakes are simply caused by our great
ignorance of ciliate diversity outside the holarctic region. Whether BUITKAMP'S species
belongs to Spathidium or Arcuospathidium needs further investigation (see also —»• Arcuo-
spathidium namibiense).
There are now five well-defined Protospathidium species: P. muscicola DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-
KERNEIS, 1979; P. serpens (KAHL, 1930a) FOISSNER, 1981b; P. terricola FOISSNER, 1998a; ->
P. namibicola nov. spec, and —> P. vermiforme nov. spec. Except of P. terricola, all are slender,
indicating that the genus evolved in soil. Further, all have rod-shaped extrusomes. Likely,
there are further species with differently shaped extrusomes, as in the other spathidiid genera.

Epispathidium polynucleatum nov. spec. (Fig. 70a-m; 329a-u; Table 58)
Diagnosis: Size about 190 x 30 urn in vivo. Indistinctly spatulate with elliptical, oblique,
thick oral bulge about as long as widest postoral body region. On average 30 ellipsoidal,
scattered macronuclear nodules and 22 ciliary rows. Extrusomes rod-shaped and distinctly
curved, about 10 x 0.5 urn. Dorsal brush inconspicuous.
Type location: Soil and litter under an Euphorbia cushion at east margin of Namib
desert, 26°40'S 16°50'E (site 13 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of poly (many) and nucleus, referring to the main feature of the
species, viz., the many macronuclear nodules.
Description: Two populations were studied in detail, viz., from Namibia (type) and
Australia. They are indistinguishable, as also evident from the very similar morphometrics
(Table 58). The description, however, is mainly based on the Namibian population, which
was cultivated (in Eau de Volvic enriched with some crushed wheat grains to stimulate
growth of small food ciliates) and investigated with the scanning electron microscope.
Size 130-230 x 25-40 urn, usually near 190 x 30 urn in vivo; length:width ratio 5-9.4:1,
frequently 6-7:1 both in vivo and protargol preparations (Table 58). Shape fairly constant and
conspicuous, that is, almost cylindroidal because oral bulge about as wide as broadest
postoral body region and flattened only in oral area (Fig. 70a, c; 329a-c). Macronuclear
pattern highly variable because nodules develop from a tortuous strand in post-dividers; thus,
about 5% of specimens have a single or few long macronuclear pieces (see discussion). Ripe
cells possess an average of 30 scattered, globular to elongate ellipsoidal, rather large (12 x 5
urn) nodules, each with a branched nucleolus or a few globular nucleoli. Many scattered
micronuclei 1.5-2.5 urn across (Fig. 70a, c; 329s, t). Contractile vacuole in rear end, several
excretory pores in posterior pole area. Extrusomes virtually identical in Namibian, Australian,
and Venezuelan population (Fig. 70a, f, h-k; 329e-g, i, o-r): ripe organelles fine, distinctly
curved rods with slightly narrowed ends, 8-10 (x = 9.3, n = 11) x 0.4-0.6 urn in size,
studded in oral bulge, except for midline, do not impregnate with the protargol method used;
many developing extrusomes scattered in cytoplasm, 6-8 urn long and with a conspicuous
central or acentral inflation about 2 urn across, impregnate heavily with protargol. Cortex
highly flexible, indistinctly furrowed by ciliary rows, contains innumerable, colourless
granules about 0.4 urn across; granules around basal bodies of cilia and between kineties,
form slightly oblique rows along or upon postciliary microtubule ribbons (Fig. 70g; 329n).
Cytoplasm colourless and hyaline in oral area, while usually packed with macronuclear
nodules and lipid droplets 1-8 urn across in postoral region. Feeds on small and medium-
sized ciliates (Protocyclidium terricola, Vorticella astyliformis, Colpoda maupasi) ingested
whole and thus recognizable in the predator's cytoplasm. Swims rather rapidly by rotation
about main body axis and shows great flexibility when creeping on soil particles or organic
debris. Specimens connected in oral area during conjugation; post-conjugates have 4-6
globular, rather large macronuclear nodules.
Somatic cilia about 10 (am long and rather closely spaced (2 urn on average; Table 58),
especially in anterior portion of rows, where a conspicuous ciliary corona is produced; form
an average of 22 straight, bipolar kineties with anterior end of left side rows slightly to
distinctly curved ventrally. Dorsal brush of ordinary structure, inconspicuous because occupying

specimen showing the typical Epispathidium pattern: the densely ciliated anterior end of the left side ciliary rows is curved

pattern is present in only few specimens, both in the Australian and Namibian population, n, o: Arcuospathidium
multinucleatum, another multinucleate species, has a rather different (Arcuospathidium) ciliary pattern: the ventral left side
ciliary rows become loosely ciliated anteriorly and curve more or less distinctly dorsally. Furthermore, the oral bulge is
usually elongate cuneate, low, and steeper than in Spathidium and Epispathidium. B - dorsal brush, MA - macronuclear
nodules, MI - micronuclei, OB - oral bulge. Scale bars 40 urn.

Oral bulge obliquely truncate by about 45°, conspicuous, although occupying only 15% of
body length, because (i) thick and up to 5 urn high, (ii) oo-shaped" in lateral and dumb-bell-
shaped in frontal view, and (iii) glossy due to the many extrusomes contained. Circumoral
kinety continuous and (sometimes indistinctly) separate from ciliary rows, composed of
dikinetids each with an associated cilium and a rather long nematodesma; nematodesmata of
neighbouring kinetids form more or less distinct bundles producing a rather conspicuous oral
basket (Fig. 70a, d, e, 1, m; 329a-e, h, i; Table 58).
Occurrence and ecology: Epispathidiumpolynucleatum occurs not only in Namibia
(Table 4), but also in the Republic of South Africa (Cape Peninsula; mosses and soil from
stones and Fynbos plants; pH 6.1), Australia (soil from rain forest near Cairns; pH 3.9; Fig.
70k-m), and South America (Venezuela; highly saline soil from a small pan in the Morrocoy
National Park; pH 7.3; Fig. 70j). Obviously, E. polynucleatum has a wide ecological range,
and thus it is surprising that Laurasian records are lacking; possibly it is substituted by
Spathidium bavariense.
Generic classification: Epispathidium polynucleatum is in between Spathidium and
Epispathidium, like its supposedly nearest relative, E. ascendens, because the left side
kineties are usually only slightly curved ventrally; however, some specimens show a typical
Epispathidium pattern (Fig. 70 1, m). Unfortunately, transitions between Protospathidium,
Spathidium, Epispathidium, and Arcuospathidium exist and impair genus distinction. On the
other hand, splitting the large genus Spathidium with the features discussed in FOISSNER
(1984) is still highly appropriate because it greatly enhances species distinction and identifi-
cation.
Comparison with related species: Epispathidium polynucleatum matches E.
ascendens WENZEL, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1987b), except for the macronucleus, which
is nodular in the former and a long, tortuous strand in the latter. However, in both species,
specimens with a tortuous or nodular macronucleus occur, albeit rarely (see also WENZEL
1955). A careful analysis of the E. polynucleatum specimens with a tortuous macronucleus
shows that these are usually post-dividers commencing macronuclear fragmentation, as
evident from the moniliform appearance of the nuclear strand and the data from —>
Spathidium turgitorum. Thus, many macronuclear nodules are the ordinary state in E.
polynucleatum, as evident from morphometry, where over 90% of the specimens have 20 or
more nodules (Table 58). On the other hand, Epispathidium ascendens usually has a single,
tortuous macronuclear strand. Thus, both are distinct, easy-to-separate species.
Epispathidium polynucleatum is also rather similar to —» Spathidium turgitorum, but
sufficiently different in the following features to be recognized as a distinct species: ciliary
pattern (epispathidiid vs. spathidiid), body width (~ 30 vs. ~ 15 urn), length:width ratio (~ 6-7
vs. ~ 9-11), extrusome length (8-10 urn vs. 3-6 urn), shape of oral bulge (elongate elliptical
vs. obovate or cuneate), number of macronuclear nodules ( ~ 30 vs. ~ 50), number of ciliary
rows ( ~ 22 vs. 12-15), and number of dikinetids in brush row 2 (~ 30 vs. ~ 20). Certainly,
some of these differences become inconspicuous in the extreme specimens, and if the
cultivated —> S. turgitorum is taken into account. This, however, should be avoided because
cultivation obviously broadened the size range artificially.
" This curious shape of the basically elongate elliptical bulge (Fig. 329i) is produced by a rather distinct twist
of its main axis, making the bulge screwed like a propeller blade (Fig. 329d, e, h).

Epispathidium regium FOISSNER, 1984, which possesses, like E. polynudeatum, many
macronuclear nodules, is distinctly stouter (3:1 vs. 6:1) and has considerably more ciliary
rows (x =41 vs. 22). There are several other spathidiids with a nodular macronucleus:
Spathidium multinudeatum GELLERT, 1955, a poorly described species, is only 80 urn long
and has "long trichites (extrusomes?)"; Spathidium seppelti PETZ & FOISSNER, 1997 and ->• S.
seppelti etoschense are distinctly stouter (3-4:1 vs. 6:1) and have short (3-6 (am), straight
extrusomes, which are distinctly different from the fine, curved extrusomes of E. poly-
nudeatum (compare micrographs!); Spathidium bavariense KAHL, 1930a is also distinctly
stouter than E. polynudeatum (3:1 vs. 6:1) and has short (4-5 urn), straight extrusomes and a
more conspicuous oral bulge with an extrusome-bearing hump at either end; Spathidium
metabolicum POMP & WlLBERT, 1988 is much more slender than E. polynudeatum (11:1 vs.
6:1) and has only 12 ciliary rows; Spathidium armatum VUXANOVICI, 1959 is only 120 urn
long and has numerous minute macronuclear nodules; Spathidium nigrum VUXANOVICI, 1959
is 280 urn long and has 24 urn long, straight extrusomes; Arcuospathidium multinudeatum
FOISSNER, 1999b is smaller than E. polynudeatum (about 140 x 20 urn vs. 190 x 30 urn in
vivo) and has a narrow, cuneate oral bulge, short (4-5 urn), straight extrusomes, and a
different ciliary pattern (Fig. 70n, o).
There are also several —> Arcuospathidium species with many macronuclear nodules, viz., A.
multinudeatum FOISSNER, 1999b, —> A. namibiense, and —» A. etoschense. Of these, only A.
multinudeatum resembles E. polynudeatum. However, A. multinudeatum has a more
oblique, distinctly cuneate oral bulge and less ciliary rows (15-18 vs. 22-25 on average).

Apertospathula nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Highly flexible Spathidiidae with continuous circumoral kinety shortened on
left side of oral bulge and thus open ventrally. Oral bulge spatulate in frontal and cuneate in
lateral view, rather distinctly set off from body proper and curved to ventral side. Dorsal
brush rows of similar length.
Type species: Apertospathula inermis nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin nouns apertum (open field) and spatha (spatula), and
the diminutive suffix ula, referring to the ventrally opened oral bulge and the similarity to
small species of the genus Spathidium. Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera: Apertospathula differs from Spathidium,
Arcuospathidium, Epispathidium, Protospathidium, and Supraspathidium, as defined by
FOISSNER (1984), by the shortened and thus ventrally opened circumoral kinety. Likely, this is
not caused by simple spatial constraints because several Arcuospathidium species with a
similarly narrow oral bulge have a closed circumoral kinety (e.g. —» A. namibiense and A.
vermiforme FOISSNER, 1984); rather, this seems to be a distinct evolutionary branch.
Certainly, the characteristics mentioned are not very different from those of the other
spathidiid genera. However, as there are three well-defined species with the same features
(see below) and the genus Spathidium already contains well over 150 species, it seems
justified to separate this group at genus level. There are many more Apertospathula species
because we found two further species in the Namibian preparations. Unfortunately, they were
not studied in vivo and thus cannot be described properly.
The general organization of Apertospathula resembles that of Arcuospathidium FOISSNER,
1984 (somatic and oral ciliature distinctly separate) and Spathidiodes KAHL, 1926, a still
poorly known genus differing from other spathidiids mainly by the bright, rigid cortex and the
short, beak-like oral bulge (Fig. 71q). At present, the status of this genus cannot be reliably
estimated, but the inflexible cortex indicates that it is considerably different from other
spathidiids, all being very flexible. Likely, Apertospathula is most closely related to Arcuo-
spathidium. This is indicated not only by the general organization mentioned above, but also
by population II of Arcuospathidium vermiforme FOISSNER, 1984, which we now consider as
a new species. We reinvestigated the slides of this species, which showed that is has a closed
circumoral kinety and thus belongs to Arcuospathidium, although the general appearance
highly resembles Apertospathula.
Apertospathula inermis nov. spec. (Fig. 71a—i; Table 59)
Diagnosis: Size about 55 x 12 urn in vivo. Indistinctly clavate to cylindroidal with oral
bulge shorter than widest postoral body region. Macronucleus ellipsoidal. No extrusomes
recognizable. On average 6 ciliary rows and 17 circumoral dikinetids. Dorsal brush three-
rowed, each row composed of 3-4 dikinetids having about 1 urn long bristles.
Type location: Sand dune near the town of St. Anthony, Idaho, USA, 43 °N 112°W.
318

Etymology: The Latin adjective inermis (unarmed) refers to the lacking extrusomes.
Description: Size 40-75 x 8-15 urn, usually near 55 x 12 urn in vivo; length:width ratio
highly variable, that is, 2.7-7:1, on average near 5:1 in protargol preparations (Table 59).
Shape usually slightly clavate because more or less distinctly inflated subapically and
narrowing posteriorly; more rarely cylindroidal or somewhat fusiform (Fig. 71a, b, d, f, h);
laterally flattened indistinctly. Macronucleus in widened anterior body half, usually elongate
ellipsoidal, in five out of 30 specimens composed of two to five small globules, and in one
cell even a tortuous strand; nucleoli globular and of ordinary size. Micronucleus attached to
macronucleus, slightly ellipsoidal (Fig. 71a, b, d, f, h). Contractile vacuole in posterior body
end. No extrusomes recognizable, even with interference contrast optics, in the three
populations investigated. Cortex thin and flexible. Cytoplasm colourless, contains some lipid
droplets. Food not known. Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia 7-8 urn long in vivo, very loosely spaced, arranged in six to seven meridional, widely
and equidistantly spaced rows anteriorly distinctly separated from circumoral kinety. Three
dorsolateral rows anteriorly differentiated to short, very inconspicuous dorsal brush composed
of paired basal bodies bearing only 1 urn long bristles difficult to recognize in vivo: rows 1
and 3 each composed of three dikinetids, row 2 with four bristle pairs on average; we did not
check whether row 3 has a monokinetidal bristle tail; one or two ordinary cilia between
anterior end of individual brush rows and circumoral kinety (Fig. 71a, d-i).
Oral bulge moderately distinct, surface slightly convex to concave and obliquely truncate
with dorsal portion higher than ventral; about 8 urn long and up to 3 urn high in vivo; cuneate
in lateral and spatulate in frontal view because gradually merging into ventral surface.
Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of an average of 17 comparatively widely
spaced dikinetids each associated with a cilium and a short nematodesma contributing to the
inconspicuous oral basket; open ventrally and longer by two to four dikinetids at right than
left side of oral bulge, as also evident from fibres extending into the bulge (Fig. 71a—i).
Occurrence and ecology: The type population was discovered in sieved litter from a
(likely volcanic) sand dune in Idaho, USA; pH 7.4. The Namibian population occurred in a
different habitat, viz., at site (29), that is, the swampy margin of a pond. In Australia, A.
inermis was found in a mud sample from a rock-pool at the entrance to the Sydney Harbour
National Park. Apertospathula inermis was rare at all sites, at least in the non-flooded Petri
dish cultures. The data indicate that it is a cosmopolitan species possibly occurring in both
terrestrial and limnetic habitats.
Comparison with related species: Apertospathula inermis is a really inconspicu-
ous ciliate because it is small and lacks distinct features, even extrusomes present in the other
species described below. The lack of light microscopically recognizable extrusomes was
carefully checked in the three populations and is thus a main feature of the species. Several
Spathidium and Spathidiodes species also lack extrusomes (KAHL 1930a), and even some
rather large Arcuospathidium species, viz., A. vermiforme FoiSSNER, 1984 and A. cooperi
FOISSNER, 1996b.
Apertospathula inermis resembles several Spathidium and Spathidiodes species, all rather
superficially described and shown in figures 71j—q. The most similar species is probably
Spathidium microstomum VUXANOVici, 1962c, which, however, has an only 3 urn wide,
button-shaped oral bulge (Fig. 71k-n). Spathidium deforme (Fig. 71p) is a true Spathidium,

according to the redescription by LEITNER & FOISSNER (1997). All other similar species have
extrusomes and/or a distinctly higher number of ciliary rows.

Apertospathula armata nov. spec. (Fig. 72a-i; Table 59)
Diagnosis: Size about 60 x 15 urn in vivo. Indistinctly spatulate to cylindroidal with oral
bulge shorter than widest body region. Macronucleus elongate ellipsoidal. Extrusomes
ellipsoidal, 1.5 urn long. On average 6 ciliary rows and 22 circumoral dikinetids. Dorsal brush
three-rowed, each row composed of 4-5 dikinetids having about 1 urn long bristles.
Type location: Loamy wheat field soil about 10 km south of Nazareth, Israel, 32°30'N
35°E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective armatus (armed) refers to the extrusomes.
Description: Size 45-75 x 10-20 urn, usually near 60 x 15 urn in vivo; length:width
ratio moderately variable, on average 3.4:1 in protargol preparations (Table 59). Shape
indistinctly spatulate, cylindroidal or fusiform, rather similar to that of -> A. inermis,
posterior third frequently wrinkled; oral area slightly flattened (Fig. 59a, b, d-f). Macro-
nucleus in anterior body half, elongate ellipsoidal (3:1) to rod-shaped (up to 7:1); nucleoli
globular to lobate. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, 3^4 urn across and thus rather
conspicuous, even in vivo (Fig. 59a, f, h). Contractile vacuole in posterior end. Extrusomes in
oral bulge, ellipsoidal to indistinctly fusiform, only about 1.5 urn long in vivo. Cytoplasm
colourless, packed with about lum-sized, bright globules and many, apparently empty
vacuoles. Swims rather rapidly showing great flexibility when squeezed by soil particles.
Somatic and oral ciliary pattern as described in A. inermis, with slight morphometric
differences shown in Table 59.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location.
Comparison with related species: See A. inermis, from which A. armata is
distinguished mainly by the extrusomes. Morphometrics are almost identical or at least
overlapping (Table 59).
Apertospathula dioplites nov. spec. (Fig. 73a-j; Table 60)
Diagnosis: Size about 95 x 20 urn in vivo. Oblong with ventral anterior third obliquely
truncate. Oral bulge in dorsal half thick and curved laterally, distinctly longer than widest
postoral body region. Macronucleus elongate reniform. Two types of extrusomes: type I
obclavate and 5-6 x 0.8-1 urn; type II rod-shaped and about 2 urn long. On average 9 ciliary
rows and 50 circumoral dikinetids. Dorsal brush three-rowed, rows 1 and 2 each composed of
eight dikinetids, row 3 of four dikinetids on average.

Etymology: Composite apposition of di (two) and hoplites (soldier ~ extrusome),
referring to a main feature of the species, viz., the two types of extrusomes.
Description: Size 65-135 x 15-30 urn in vivo, usually about 95 x 20 urn; length:width
ratio near 4-5:1; flattened up to 2:1 laterally, especially in oral region. Shape rather variable
because posteriorly narrowed or widened, basically oblong with ventral anterior third, where
the oral bulge extends, obliquely truncate (Fig. 73a, b, e; Table 60); very flexible but
acontractile; postoral portion frequently wrinkled in protargol preparations. Macronucleus
usually in anterior body half, elongate reniform with ends often slightly inflated; nucleoli
small, globular and numerous. Micronucleus usually attached to concave side of macro-
nucleus, broadly ellipsoidal, rather large and thus easy to recognize in vivo (Fig. 73a, f).
Contractile vacuole in rear end, excretory pore(s) not impregnated. Cortex very flexible, thin,
contains loosely spaced, pale granules about 0.2 urn across. Two shape and size types of
extrusomes, which do not impregnate with the protargol method used, in oral bulge and
cytoplasm (Fig. 73a, c, g): type I obclavate and 5-6 x 0.7-1 urn in size, less numerous than
type II, a 4-5 urn long developmental stage impregnates in the cytoplasm; type II rod-shaped
and about 2 urn long. Cytoplasm colourless, usually crammed with fat globules 0.2-10 urn
across and large food vacuoles containing remnants of ciliates, especially Metopus hasei; in
protargol preparations studded with minute, black granules having a similar size as basal
bodies and thus disturbing the analysis of the infraciliature. Glides rather rapidly on soil
particles and microscope slide.
Cilia about 12 urn long in vivo and protargol preparations, very loosely spaced, arranged in
an average of nine widely and equidistantly spaced rows distinctly separate from circumoral
kinety. Three dorsal rows anteriorly differentiated to short but rather conspicuous brush
composed of paired basal bodies with up to 6 urn long bristles, some showing an unusual
impregnation capability (Fig. 73a, e, f): row 1 composed of an average of eight dikinetids, of
which the anterior bristle of the four posteriormost pairs impregnates rather intensely with
protargol (Fig. 73e, h); row 2 also composed of an average of eight dikinetids with posterior
bristles up to 6 urn long; row 3 consists of an average of four dikinetids with up to 5 urn long
bristles and has a monokinetidal tail with 3 urn long bristles that impregnate intensely with
the protargol method used (Fig. 73f, i; Table 60).
Oral apparatus occupies oblique anterior body third and is thus distinctly longer than widest
postoral region. Oral bulge slightly convex and rather conspicuous because bright due to the
extrusomes contained and 3—4 urn high with thick dorsal third curved laterally, exposing
bulge front to the observer; ventral half flattened distinctly, bulge thus slenderly cuneate in
frontal view (Fig. 73a, b, d). Circumoral kinety open ventrally, as is typical for the genus, left
branch ends subapically, while right likely extends to near body end, as indicated by the
kinetids of the first kinety, which are slightly enlarged and more intensely impregnated;
however, nematodesmata and extrusomes are recognizable only in the anterior body third, but
this does not disprove our suggestion because the former are very fine and faintly impreg-
nated only in the holotype specimen (Fig. 73e, f). Circumoral kinetids widely spaced, except
in dorsal region of kinety, each associated with an about 12 urn long cilium and a short, fine
nematodesma contributing to the indistinct oral basket.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was very rare
(about 30 specimens in 15 slides), but present for three weeks. Likely, we fixed the culture
too early because some dividers were found, indicating onset of exponential growth phase.

Several of the specimens contained up to three only partially digested Metopus hasei,
indicating that A. dioplites is a very effective predator that rapidly engulfs prey.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: If our
interpretation is correct that the right branch of the circumoral kinety extends to almost
posterior body end, A. dioplites is an extreme member of the genus because the length
difference in the right and left branch of the circumoral kinety is much more pronounced than
in —> A. inermis and —> A. armata. Likewise, the two extrusome types and the curious
impregnation pattern of some brush bristles indicate that A dioplites is the representative of a
new genus. On the other hand, the general organization is quite similar to Apertospathula,
especially the open circumoral kinety. Thus, we assign the species to that genus at the present
state of knowledge.

As concerns the species, A. dioplites is distinctly different from the congeners described
above and from all Spathidium sensu lato species by the two types of extrusomes and the
main genus feature, viz., the open circumoral kinety. As the cortex is flexible, it also cannot
be identical to any of the Spathidiodes species mentioned in the discussion of the genus.
Semispathidium nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Spathidiidae with discoidal oral bulge and Spathidium-Mke oral and somatic
infraciliature.
Type species: Semispathidium enchelyodontides nov. gen.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin prefix semi (partially) and the Latin noun spatha
(spatula), referring to the lack of a Spathidium-Mke appearance. Neuter gender.
Comparison with related genera: The best justification for classifying Semi-
spathidium enchelyodontides into a new genus is the fact that, based on the general appear-
ance, nobody would assign it to Spathidium s. 1., but likely classify it into —» Enchelyodon, as
we did in our notebook. However, silver impregnation reveals a basically spathidiid infra-
ciliature, that is, somatic kineties with curved anterior end and a slightly twisted circumoral
kinety. —> Enchelyodon, in contrast, has meridional kineties and a flat circumoral kinety.
Actually, it is only the small, discoidal oral bulge which produces the deviating appearance.
In this respect, Semispathidium resembles -> Protospathidium which, however, has the
circumoral kinety fragments distinctly separated. —> Apospathidium has oralized somatic
monokinetids.
We do not expect that this new spathidiid genus is "sharper" than those defined by FOISSNER
(1984), that is, species with transitions to Spathidium and/or Protospathidium likely will be
found. In spite of this, it is evident that Semispathidium enchelyodontides is far from ordinary
Spathidium species, representing a divergent evolutionary line needing generic separation.
This is also evident from the second species, —» Semispathidium armatum.
Species assignable: Spathidium lagyniforme KAHL, 1930a has the same infraciliature
as Semispathidium enchelyodontides, according to the redescription by FOISSNER (1984).
Interestingly, already KAHL (1930a) mentioned that "it is not a typical Spathidium". Thus, it is
transferred to the new genus: Semispathidium lagyniforme (KAHL, 1930a) nov. comb. Likely,
several other —» Spathidium and Enchelyodon species reviewed in KAHL (1930a) or described
later, also belong to Semispathidium, e.g., Spathidium cylindricum and Enchelyodon
mucicola. However, detailed data are necessary before any new combinations are established.
Semispathidium enchelyodontides nov. spec. (Fig. 74a-l; 328i; Table 61)
Diagnosis: Size about 160 x 23 urn in vivo; cylindroidal to indistinctly obclavate. On
average 21 macronuclear nodules. Two size-types of rod-shaped extrusomes: type I about 30
urn long, forms conspicuous bundle attached to centre of oral bulge; type II about 3 urn long,

forms a ring in margin of oral bulge. On
average 15 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differenti-
ated to moderately distinct dorsal brush.
Type location: Mud and soil from road
puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter
2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of Enchelyodon and
the Greek suffix ides (look like), referring to
the similarity with species of the genus ->•
Enchelyodon.
Description: Size 120-210 x 20-35 urn in
vivo, usually near 160 x 23 um; length:width
ratio highly variable, viz., 3.5-9.6:1, on average
about 7:1 in protargol preparations. Shape
inconspicuous, that is, cylindroidal to slightly
obclavate or fusiform, anterior end somewhat
inclined ventrally, posterior rounded; usually
slightly curved when swimming; unflattened
and acontractile (Fig. 74a, b, f; 328i; Table 61).
Nuclear apparatus in central quarters of cell,
1 consists of an average of 21 scattered macro-
nuclear nodules and 7 globular micronuclei.
Individual nodules globular to ellipsoidal, frequently more or less distinctly dumb-bell-
shaped, about 8 x6 urn in vivo and protargol preparations, usually contain a large, lobate
nucleolus; rarely, several nodules form a somewhat moniliform pattern. Contractile vacuole
in rear end, several excretory pores in posterior pole area. Two size-types of rod-shaped
extrusomes (Fig. 74a, c, h-j; 328i): type I in vivo approximately 30 urn long, fine and
flexible, forms conspicuous bundle attached to central area of oral bulge and several smaller
cytoplasmic bundles, posterior 3-5 urn impregnate heavily with protargol; type II extrusomes
about 3 urn long, rod-like to indistinctly flask-shaped, form a ring in margin of oral bulge,
numerous and scattered in cytoplasm, posterior half occasionally heavily impregnates with
protargol. Cortex very flexible, contains dense rows of refractive granules about 0.8 x 0.4 urn
in size. Cytoplasm colourless, in well-fed specimens packed with globular and irregular fat
inclusions 1-10 urn across. Feeds on heterotrophic flagellates and middle-sized ciliates, such
as Gonostomum strenuum, which are ingested whole producing up to 50 x 25 um-sized food
vacuoles. Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.

Cilia about 8 um long in vivo, widely spaced (4 urn), especially in neck region, arranged in
an average of 15 equidistant, bipolar rows anteriorly densely ciliated and curved dorsally on
right side of cell, while ventrally on left, as in —» Spathidium (FOISSNER 1984). Three dorsal
rows anteriorly differentiated to moderately conspicuous dorsal brush with up to 4 urn long,
distally slightly inflated bristles. Brush rows 1 and 2 of almost same length, but composed of
11, respectively, 17 dikinetids; row 3 shorter than rows 1 and 2, composed of an average of 9
dikinetids and an about 40 urn long, monokinetidal tail of 1-1.5 urn long bristles (Fig. 74a, f,
g,j-l;328i; Table 61).
Oral bulge discoidal, conspicuous because occupying anterior end of cell and about 13 x 5
jam in size, surface slightly convex; margin contains type II extrusomes, as described above,
producing a nice, crown-like pattern when impregnated with protargol (Fig. 74j); bulge centre
slightly to distinctly opened, forming a long, obconical inner oral basket lined by fibres
originating from circumoral dikinetids (Fig. 74h). Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, co-
shaped, that is, slightly twisted relative to transverse axis of cell (Fig. 74h), composed of
comparatively widely spaced dikinetids associated with fibres extending anteriorly, as
described above, and fine nematodesmata forming an about 30 urn long, outer oral basket
only occasionally impregnated with the protargol method used (Fig. 74a, b, h, j, k; 328i;
Table 61).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location. The slender shape
indicates that S. enchelyodontides is a true soil inhabitant. It was moderately abundant in the
non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Comparison with related species: This is a conspicuous ciliate with several
distinct features, such as the long, slender body; the nodular macronucleus; and the 30 urn
long extrusomes. Thus, it is easily identified and distinguished from —» S. armatum and S.
lagyniforme, which have an ellipsoidal macronucleus. On the other hand, similar features are
found in several Enchelyodon and Enchelys species, for instance, Enchelyodon terrenus
FOISSNER, 1984 (200-300 urn long, extrusomes acicular and only 14 urn long, 100-300
macronuclear nodules) and Enchelys terricola FOISSNER, 1987b (slenderly bursiform,
extrusomes only 5 urn long). Thus, reliable identification requires protargol impregnation to
reveal the co-shaped circumoral kinety and the curved anterior end of the ciliary rows.

Semispathidium armatum nov. spec. (Fig. 75a-j; Table 61)
Diagnosis: Size about 270 x 40 urn in vivo; cylindroidal to indistinctly fusiform.
Macronucleus ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal. Oral extrusomes obclavate with rod-shaped
331

anterior process, total size about 10 x 1 |im. On average 21 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly
differentiated to moderately distinct dorsal brush with row 2 about twice as long as conspicu-
ously shortened row 3.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective armatus (armed) refers to a main feature of the species,
viz., the conspicuous extrusomes.
Description: Size conspicuous, that is, 180-320 x 30-50 urn in vivo, usually near 270 x
40 urn; length:width ratio 4.4—8.1, on average 5.6:1 in protargol preparations. Shape
inconspicuous, that is, slightly fusiform in vivo and distinctly so in preparations, anterior end
slanted ventrally, posterior rounded; unflattened and acontractile (Fig. 75a, e; Table 61).
Macronucleus in or near mid-body, rod-shaped to slightly reniform, ellipsoidal (2:1) to
distinctly oblong (5:1); nucleolus reticulate. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus at
varying position, about 5 urn across in vivo. Contractile vacuole in rear end, an average of six
excretory pores in posterior pole area. Extrusomes scattered in cytoplasm and attached to oral
bulge forming a ring-like array; conspicuous because 8-12 x 0.8-1 urn in size and obclavate
with an about 5 urn long rod projecting anteriorly; mature organelles occasionally impregnate
brownish with protargol, while a certain cytoplasmic developmental stage stains black (Fig.
75a-d). Cortex very flexible, contains rather dense rows of colourless granules. Cytoplasm
packed with fat globules up to 5 urn across in well-nourished specimens; likely feeds on
protists. Swims moderately fast by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 12 urn long in vivo, rather loosely spaced in neck region, arranged in an average
of 21 equidistant, bipolar rows anteriorly densely ciliated and curved dorsally on right side of
cell, while ventrally on left, as in —» Spathidium (FoiSSNER 1984). Three dorsal rows
anteriorly differentiated to rather conspicuous dorsal brush with up to 6 urn long bristles,
anterior bristle of pairs shortened. Brush row 1 slightly shorter than row 2, composed of an
average of 25 dikinetids; row 2 twice as long as row 3, composed of 40 dikinetids on average;
row 3 distinctly shortened consisting of only 14 dikinetids on average, but has a mono-
kinetidal tail of 3 urn long bristles extending to at least mid-body (Fig. 75a, e-g, i, j; Table
61).
Oral bulge discoidal, moderately conspicuous occupying most of anterior end of cell, about
15 urn across and 4-5 urn high. Bulge centre slightly depressed and lined by an x-shaped
fibrillar core (inner oral basket) extending up to 10 urn into the cell. Circumoral kinety at base
of oral bulge, flat as in —» Enchelyodon, composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids associated
with fine nematodesmata forming small bundles, which produce a rather inconspicuous,
cylindroidal to conical, about 25 urn long oral basket impregnating with protargol (Fig. 75a,
f-h; Table 61).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was very rare
in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. The slender shape indicates that S. armatum is a true soil
inhabitant. Interestingly, S. armatum occurred at the same site and habitat as -» S. enchelyo-
dontides.
Comparison with related species: This conspicuous ciliate is easily identified
and distinguished from the two congeners, viz., —» S. enchelyodontides and S. lagyniforme, by
the large size, the reniform macronucleus, and the obclavate extrusomes. On the other hand,

similar features are found in several Enchelyodon and Enchelys species, for instance,
Enchelyodon terrenus FOISSNER, 1984 (many macronuclear nodules). Thus, reliable identifi-
cation requires protargol impregnation to reveal the curved anterior end of the ciliary rows.
Enchelyodon vermiforme, discovered by DRAGESCO (1970) in an ephemeral puddle in
Cameroun, likely belongs to Semispathidium and is very similar to S. armatum, differing
mainly by the 50 urn long, rod-shaped extrusomes. Unfortunately, the ciliary pattern is not
known, and thus it cannot be combined with Semispathidium.
Apospathidium nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Amphoriform Spathidiidae (?) with oblique oral bulge. Oral basket rods
(nematodesmata) originate from stepped dikinetidal kinetofragments and oralized mono-
kinetids in the anterior region of the somatic kineties.
Type species: Apospathidium terricolanov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the Greek generic
name Spathidium (spatulate animal), referring to the presumed nearest relative. Neuter
gender.
Comparison with related genera and species assignable: This ciliate
was a real surprise because it looked like an ordinary Spathidium. However, protargol
impregnation revealed a unique feature as yet known mainly from the Enchelyina, viz.,
oralized somatic monokinetids (Fig. 76n; 330a, b). Thus, we cannot exclude that the
spathidiid features evolved convergently and Apospathidium belongs to the Enchelyina
FOISSNER & FOISSNER (1988). This is emphasized by the rows of body extrusomes present in
Apospathidium and some Enchelyina (e.g. —> Diplites), but lacking in spathidiids s. str.
However, more distantly related spathidiids, such as —> Apobryophyllum, also have rows of
body extrusomes. In any case, the general appearance and some specific features, such as the
location and structure of the oral kinetofragments, of A. terricola and —> A. atypicum are so
near to Spathidium that an enchelyine relationship is difficult to believe.
A reinvestigation of —> Apospathidium atypicum showed that it has the same features as
Apospathidium terricola. Thus, it will be transferred to that genus (see below). Both,
BUITKAMP & WILBERT (1974) and FOISSNER (1981b), who redescribed this species, could not
find the oral basket in their preparations and thus missed its special structure.
Apospathidium terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 76a-j; 330a-c; Table 62)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 x 35 urn in vivo. Slenderly amphoriform with short tail and
oblique oral bulge about two thirds as long as widest trunk region. Macronucleus rod-shaped.
Single micronucleus about 5 urn across. Contractile vacuole distinctly subterminal. Oral
bulge and body extrusomes rod-shaped, about 5 urn long, the latter in 2 to 3 rows between
each two kineties. On average 11 ciliary rows, 4 anteriorly differentiated to inconspicuous
dorsal brush occupying about 10% of body length.

Type location: Mud and soil from granitic rock-pools on the Spitzkoppe, an Inselberg in
the Namib Escarpment, Namibia, 21°45'S 15°8'E (site 41 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective terricola (living in soil) refers to the habitat the species
was discovered.
Description: The species was rare at both sites (5, 41), and only one specimen from site
41 (type location) was observed in vivo, but two of the five specimens contained in the
protargol slides were excellently impregnated. Morphometry was supplemented with three
specimens from site (5). Altogether, data are sufficient for a reliable description, but should
be refined from a more abundant population.
Size 130-170 x 25-50 urn in vivo, usually near 150 x 35 urn, length:width ratio 2.8-5.6:1, on
average near 4:1 both in vivo and protargol preparations, where specimens are slightly
inflated in mid-body. Slenderly amphoriform with oblique oral bulge about two thirds as long
as widest trunk region, narrowed neck, and bluntly pointed posterior end (Fig. 76a, j; Table
62); flattened laterally, acontractile. Macronucleus in middle third of cell, rod-shaped and
more or less distinctly tortuous, about 50 x 7 urn; nucleoli globular or lobate. Micronucleus
attached to mid-region of macronucleus, about 5 urn across and surrounded by a distinct
membrane. Contractile vacuole and about 10 dorsolateral excretory pores in rather long row
far subterminal (Fig. 76a, i, j). Oral bulge and body extrusomes rod-shaped, about 5 ^m long,
in several indistinct rows in oral bulge and between somatic kineties; posterior half usually
impregnates with protargol (Fig. 76a, d, f, g). Cortex flexible, contains closely spaced rows of
granules about 1 urn across, between which the strongly refractive extrusomes are located
(Fig. 76d, e). Cytoplasm colourless, contains many lipid droplets up to 10 urn across and
large food vacuoles with remnants of protozoa. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide.
Cilia arranged in an average of 11 widely spaced, bipolar, moderately densely ciliated rows
distinctly curved at base of oral bulge, where conspicuous dikinetidal kinetofragments form a
stepped circumoral kinety. Dorsal brush four-rowed (three-rowed in one out of eight
specimens), inconspicuous because occupying only 10% of body length and bristles merely
up to 4 urn long; all rows continue as somatic kineties posteriorly; row 1 composed of an
average of eight dikinetids, row 2 of nine, row 3 of thirteen, and row 4 of four bristle pairs
(Fig. 76a-c, j; 330a-c; Table 62).
Oral bulge about two thirds as long as widest trunk region and about 5 urn high in vivo,
obliquely truncate, slightly convex and elongate elliptical in frontal view; contains faintly
impregnated fibres originating from the anterior basal bodies of the dikinetidal circumoral
fragments and extending obliquely to the slightly acentric bulge opening. Circumoral kinety
elongate elliptical, composed of conspicuous, dikinetidal kinetofragments attached to the
somatic kineties; individual fragments composed of 7-14 dikinetids, which show the different
(angular) orientation of the basal bodies very clearly (Fig. 76h); fragments stepped because
slightly curved and distance between basal bodies of individual dikinetids becomes gradually
wider from distal to proximal, a curious feature shown in figure 76h. Oral basket inconspicu-
ous because not sharply defined and basket rods (nematodesmata) do not form bundles.
Nematodesmata originate from dikinetidal kinetofragments (possibly even from both bodies
of a pair) and up to 20 oralized somatic monokinetids in the anterior region of the ciliary rows
(Fig. 76a-c, f, h, j; 330a-c).

Comparison with related species: Apospathidium terricola has, like the single
congener, —• A. atypicum, a highly characteristic, slenderly amphoriform shape and thus
cannot be confused with any other member of the family. Both are easily distinguished in
vivo and protargol preparations by the length:width ratio (near 4:1 vs. 9:1), the number of
extrusome rows between the kineties (several vs. one), the number of ciliary rows (10-13 vs.
7-8), and the number of dorsal brush rows (4 vs. 3).
Apospathidium atypicum (BUITKAMP & WILBERT, 1974) nov. comb. (Fig. 77a-
j; Table 62)
1974 Spathidium atypicum n. sp. BUITKAMP & WILBERT, Acta Protozool., 13: 202.
1977 Spathidium longicaudatum n. nom. BUITKAMP, Decheniana, 130: 117 (replacement name because of
preoccupation).
1981 Spathidium longicaudatum BUITKAMP 1977 - FOISSNER, Zool. Jb. Syst., 108: 275 (redescription).
Nomenclature: The original name of the species {atypicum) becomes valid because
atypicum is not occupied in the genus Apospathidium (articles 59, 60 of the ICZN 1999).
Type material: BUITKAMP'S protargol slides are completely bleached, suggesting
neotypification. However, our material is from a different biogeographic region and the
identity of the species not threatened at present. Thus, neotypification can await redescription
of a Canadian or, at least, North American population. Of course, we deposit voucher material
of the Kenyan specimens (Table 1).
Improved diagnosis (including literature data): Size about 125 x 20 urn in vivo. Very
slenderly amphoriform with fairly distinct tail and oblique oral bulge about two thirds as long
as widest trunk region. Macronucleus rod-shaped. Single micronucleus approximately 4 urn
across. Contractile vacuole 22% subterminal on average. Oral and body extrusomes rod-
shaped, 3-4 urn long. On average 9 ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differentiated to inconspicuous
dorsal brush occupying about 10% of body length.
Observations: Our data basically match those of BUITKAMP & WILBERT (1974) and
FOISSNER (1981b), except of the oral basket, as discussed above. Thus and because most
important features can be seen in the figures and morphometrics, we emphasize only the
following details: (i) Shape invariably very slenderly amphoriform and highly characteristic
due to the tail-like posterior third (Fig. 77a-c, h); (ii) Macronucleus invariable of the shape of
a short, more or less tortuous rod (Fig. 77a, c, h); (iii) Contractile vacuole conspicuously
subterminal, on average 22% of body length (x = 24.4 urn, SD = 7.5 urn, CV = 30.8%, Min =
13 um, Max = 40 um, n = 19), that is, underneath base of tail. Several scattered excretory
pores on dorsal side of cell (Fig. 77b, c, h); (iv) Extrusomes in oral bulge and attached to
somatic cortex likely somewhat different because only the somatic ones lightly impregnate
with protargol (Fig. 77g, j). The following shapes and sizes were observed: rod-shaped, 2.8-
3.5 x ~ 0.4 urn (Namibian site 1); rod-shaped, oral extrusomes 4 urn long, body extrusomes
about 2.5 x 0.2 urn (Namibian site 2); slightly fusiform and 3 urn long (Namibian sites 16,
17); rod-shaped and fine, about 4 x 0.2 urn (Venezuelan population); (v) Somatic and oral

monokinetids). Note the short, inconspicuous dorsal brush. B - dorsal brush, Bl-3 - dorsal brush rows, BA - oral basket, CG

339

ciliary pattern as described in —» A. terricola. Dorsal brush inconspicuous because occupying
only 10% of body length and longest bristles only 3-4 urn high; row 3 with a short mono-
kinetidal bristle tail, (vi) Oral bulge obovate, while circumoral kinety distinctly cuneate, a
remarkable difference observed in several specimens (Fig. 77d, f). Kinetofragments of right
half of circumoral kinety often incompletely aligned, producing the stepped (protospathidiid)
pattern typical for the genus (Fig. 77a-c, h, e, f, i, j).
Occurrence and ecology: Apospathidium atypicum has been reported from all main
biogeographic regions, except of Antarctica (FOISSNER 1998a). Interestingly, the species is
frequent, but never develops high abundances in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures. With its
slender, flexible body, A. typicum is perfectly adapted to terrestrial habitats and to exploit
even narrow soil pores.
Comparison with literature data and related species: Our observations
basically match the original description and the redescription by FOISSNER (1981b). The
Austrian specimens supposedly lack body extrusomes and has an elliptical circumoral kinety.
However, FoiSSNER's data are not very detailed, and thus the differences might be caused by
incomplete observations.
Apospathidium atypicum differs from —» A. terricola by the cuneate (vs. elliptical) oral bulge,
the number of dorsal brush rows (three vs. four), and most morphometrics. Basically, A.
terricola is larger and massiver than A. atypicum, which makes both easily distinguishable
even in vivo.
Bryophyllum paucistriatum nov. spec. (Fig. 78a-w; 331a-d; Table 63)
Diagnosis: Body size (usually between 100-150 x 40-45 urn) and shape (narrowly to
broadly lanceolate) and macronucleus (elongate reniform to a 120 (im long strand composed
of up to 8 nodules) highly variable. Two types of extrusomes: type I rod-shaped to indistinctly
acicular, moderately thick, about 8 jam long; type II rod-shaped, fine, about 2 urn long. On
average 10-14 ciliary rows, 4-6 anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush.
Type location: Savannah soil of the Masei Mara National Reserve, Kenya, 01°30'S
34°55'E.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjectives pauci (few) and striatus (striated ~ ciliary
rows), referring to the low number of ciliary rows, a main species feature.
Description: Several populations were observed (see occurrence and ecology section).
The diagnosis refers to those from Kenya and Namibian site (56), which were studied in
detail. Size and shape of the body and macronucleus are extremely variable, both within and
among populations (Table 63). As the extremes are connected by many transitions, we
exclude having mixed up two cryptic species; however, we cannot exclude the occurrence of
distinct races, possibly distinguishable at subspecies level; this is also indicated by the rather
different extrusomes which, however, lack a biogeographic pattern.
Size 90-200 x 25-60 urn in vivo, usually 100-150 x 40-45 urn; length:width ratio also
highly variable, viz., 1.5-7.8:1, especially in Namibian population (Table 63); slightly
340

contractile, under moderate cover-glass pressure up to 30%. Shape as is typical for genus, but
highly variable, that is, broadly to slenderly lanceolate with ventral margin more or less
distinctly convex and dorsal straight, slightly convex or concave (Fig. 78a, g, h, m-q);
anterior ventral portion curved to left side in swimming specimens and frequently slightly set
off, forming a spathidiid pattern; laterally flattened 2-3:1, depending on nutrition (Fig. 78g,
k-m, o, p, r, v). Nuclear apparatus usually in middle third of cell. Macronucleus of Kenyan
type population rod-shaped to elongate reniform, that of Namibian site (56) specimens rod-
shaped, elongate reniform, or an up to 120 urn long, tortuous strand snowing up to eight,
usually four nodules (Fig. 78a, g, m-q, s, w). Micronucleus discoidal, about 6x3 urn in vivo,
attached to macronucleus. Contractile vacuole near posterior dorsal margin of cell, about six
to ten excretory pores on right side, viz., left of rear end of oral bulge (Fig. 78a, s, w). Two
types of oral extrusomes, studied in five populations (Fig. 78a-g, i; 331a-d): type I forms
short, oblique, bright rows and is, depending on population, rod-shaped to indistinctly
acicular or fusiform, straight or slightly curved, moderately thick, and 5—10 urn long; type II
very inconspicuous, rod-shaped, fine, 1.5-3 urn long, depending on population. Cortex very
flexible, contains closely spaced rows of colourless, minute (< 0.5 fim) granules that
impregnate rather heavily with protargol, hiding the infraciliature. Cytoplasm colourless, in
well-fed specimens packed with fat inclusions 3-7 urn across and some large food vacuoles.
Feeds on heterotrophic flagellates {Polytomella sp., Astasia sp.) and small ciliates {Lepto-
pharynx costatus), both ingested whole and thus recognizable for some time in the food
vacuoles. Glides slowly on microscope slide and soil particles, showing great flexibility;
rarely swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, rather closely spaced, especially in mid-body, probably due to
some contraction of cells during fixation (see above); arranged in an average of 11 (Namibian
population) to 14 (Kenyan population) rows following body curvature and abutting on both
halves of circumoral kinety in anterior and posterior quarter of cell; rows slightly wider
spaced in midline of organism, two of them inconspicuously shortened above excretory pores
of contractile vacuole. All or most left side kineties anteriorly differentiated to short and thus
inconspicuous dorsal brush composed of about 3 urn long, closely spaced bristles (Fig. 78a, r,
s, u; 331c, d; Table 63); no second brush in mid-body of dorsal side, as described by GELEI
(1934) in some species.
Oral apparatus occupies entire body length and curves around posterior end onto dorsal side
for about 10 urn. Oral bulge about 5 urn high and glossy due to the many extrusomes
contained, thus very distinct in vivo; slightly widened and opened anteriorly. Circumoral
kinety at base of oral bulge, very elongate elliptical, composed of closely spaced dikinetids
each associated with acilium and a long nematodesma in anterior body half, while only each
third to fifth dikinetid has a short and thin rod in posterior half; oral basket thus distinct only
in anterior body half (Fig. 78a, g, h, k, 1, r-w; 331c, d; Table 63).
Occurrence and ecology: Bryophyllum paucistriatum is likely distributed globally
and oligo- to mesohaline because we found it not only in Kenya (type locality; dark grey,
very hard savannah soil, pH 6.5), but also in Namibia (Table 4; Fig. 78c, m-q), Utah, USA
(slightly saline soil from a swamp near the village of Brigham; Fig. 78f), Spain (Toledo; Fig.
78e), and Austria (beech litter from the surroundings of Salzburg; Fig. 78d). Abundances
were usually low, except at Namibian site (56), where high numbers developed in the non-
flooded Petri dish culture.

Comparison with related species: Bryophyllum paucistriatum is most similar to
B. hyalinum GELEI, 1936, although this species is considerably narrower (100-110x18 urn),
because it has the same body length, nuclear pattern, and number of ciliary rows. However,
GELEI (1936) definitely states that B. hyalinum has three dorsal brush rows, while B.
paucistriatum has four to six, usually five (Table 63). This difference looks inconspicuous.
However, there are two groups of bryophyllids: one with three dorsal brush rows, as is typical
for Spathidium, e.g., B. tegularum (FoiSSNER 1984) and B. loxophylliforme (KAHL 1931b),
and another with four or more rows, such as B. paucistriatum (four to six rows), -> B. lingua
(ten rows), and B. carinatum GELEI, 1934 (twenty rows). As the number of brush rows is
344

apparently independent ofthat of ciliary rows, as shown by B. paucistriatum and -» B. lingua,
this feature should not be under-estimated. Bryophyllum paucistriatum is also highly similar
to B. vorax (STOKES, 1886b) KAHL, 1931b, differing only in the shape of the macronucleus,
which is elongate reniform in the former and ovate in the latter. This difference is stable
because we never saw an ovate macronucleus in several populations of B. paucistriatum.
Bryophyllum spathidioides GELEI, 1954 has 35 ciliary rows, of which seven are differentiated
to brush kineties, while B. paucistriatum has a maximum of 16 ciliary rows, of which only 4—
6 form the brush.
Bryophyllum lingua GELEI, 1934
Improved diagnosis: Size about 160-250 x 40-120 urn in vivo; slenderly to broadly
lanceolate with posterior end of oral bulge in last dorsal fifth of cell and distinctly set off from
body proper. Many (> 50) ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules. About 16-50 ciliary rows,
approximately 10 anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush.
Remarks and comparison with related species: We split this species into
two subspecies differing distinctly in some main morphometrics. Unfortunately, GELEI (1934)
does not provide details on the extrusomes. Thus, the classification of our population is
somewhat doubtful and the feature cannot be included in the diagnosis. Further, GELEI
described dorsal brush rows anteriorly and in mid-body in all the Bryophyllum species he
investigated. However, later and the present investigations could not confirm the mid-body
brush rows. Likely, this was a misobservation, or GELEI observed dividers, which produce the
dorsal brush very early, that is, before cell furrowing commences.
Bryophyllum lingua is similar to B. loxophylliforme KAHL, 1931b, which, however, has only
three dorsal brush rows and the oral bulge less distinctly set off from the dorsal surface. As
explained under —> B. paucistriatum, the main distinguishing feature is the dorsal brush, viz.,
three rows in B. loxophylliforme vs. about ten in B. lingua. Unfortunately, a detailed
redescription of B. loxophylliforme is not available.
Bryophyllum lingua lingua GELEI, 1934 nov. stat. (Fig. 79t-v)
Diagnosis (after GELEI): Size about 160-200 x 40-50 urn in vivo; slenderly lanceolate
with a length:width ratio near 4:1. 16-18 ciliary rows.
Type location: Soda pools near Szeged, Hungary.
Bryophyllum lingua multistriatum nov. sspec. (Fig. 79a-s; 332a-d; Table 64)
Diagnosis: Size about 220 x 80 ^m in vivo; lanceolate with an average length:width ratio
345

of 2.5:1. Two types of extrusomes: type I acicular, about 8 x 0.5 urn in size; type II rod-
shaped, fine, about 1.5 urn long. On average 40 ciliary rows.
Type location: Mud from granitic rock-pools of a stream in the Daan Viljoen Game
Park near Windhoek, Namibia, 22°35'S 17°05'E (site 73 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective multistriatum (many striae) refers to the high number of
ciliary rows this subspecies possesses.
Description: Size 180-250 x 50-120 urn in vivo, usually near 220 x 80 (am; length:width
ratio 1.6-3.5:1, on average 2.5:1 in protargol preparations; highly flexible and somewhat
contractile, as indicated by slight shape changes. Shape as is typical for genus, but rather
variable, that is, slenderly to broadly lanceolate, sometimes with spathidiid anterior region
and often with an irregular, undulate outline; anterior third flattened leaf-like and thus
hyaline, central and posterior region usually dark at low magnification (< xlOO) and only
slightly flattened because packed with food inclusions (Fig. 79a, f, i-p; 332a; Table 64). Most
macronuclear nodules scattered in posterior body half; individual nodules with minute
nucleoli and highly variable in size and shape, on average ellipsoidal. Many minute, ellip-
soidal micronuclei scattered between and attached to macronuclear nodules (Fig. 79a, c, f).
Contractile vacuole and excretory pores subterminal near left dorsal margin of cell (Fig. 79a,
h, j, k, n, p). Two types of extrusomes in oral bulge and cytoplasm, impregnate heavily with
silver carbonate but not with protargol (Fig. 79a, b, e, i; 332c, d): type I conspicuous, forms
short, transverse, bright rows in the oral bulge, acicular and slightly curved, about 8x0.5 urn
in size; type II very inconspicuous, rod-shaped, fine, about 1.5 urn long. Cortex very flexible,
contains closely spaced rows of colourless, minute (< 0.5 urn) granules that do not impreg-
nate with protargol. Cytoplasm colourless, in well-fed specimens packed with fat globules up
to 10 urn across and small and large food vacuoles containing up to 110 urn long rotifers and
indeterminable matter, likely remnants from ciliates. Glides slowly on microscope slide and
soil particles showing great flexibility.
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, very closely spaced in rows along right body margin, while
loosely so in anterior body third and left posterior body margin, arranged in an average of 40
rows following body curvature and abutting to both halves of circumoral kinety anteriorly and
posteriorly; many rows interrupted and/or shortened anteriorly and/or posteriorly without any
regularity. On average nine left side kineties anteriorly differentiated to rather conspicuous
dorsal brush composed of closely spaced dikinetids bearing slightly inflated bristles increas-
ing in length from about 2.5 urn in right rows to 5 urn in leftmost row, which has a mono-
kinetidal bristle tail extending to mid-body; left three brush rows distinctly longer than others
(Fig. 79a, g, h, r, s; 332a, b; Table 64). No second brush in mid-body of dorsal side, as
described by GELEI (1934).
Oral apparatus occupies entire body length and curves around posterior end onto dorsal side
for an average of 40 urn in protargol preparations (Table 64). Oral bulge about 10 ^im high
and 5 urn wide anteriorly, glossy due to the many extrusomes contained, and thus very
distinct in vivo; becomes narrower posteriorly. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, very
elongate elliptical, composed of closely spaced dikinetids each associated with a cilium and a
nematodesma decreasing in length from anterior to posterior; cilia so closely spaced that a
membranoid structure is formed, especially in anterior body half, where the nematodesmata
are long and form distinct bundles (Fig. 79a, d-h, s; 332a, c).
346

Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and in a soil sample from
the Cape Peninsula, Republic of South Africa, indicating that it is a true terrestrial species. It
was rare in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures from both sites.
Comparison with related species (see "Remarks" by -» B. lingua above) and
nominal subspecies: At first glance, Bryophyllum lingua multistriatum looks like a
distinct species. However, a more detailed analysis shows transitions to B. lingua lingua in
size and shape (Fig. 79k, t) and number of macronuclear nodules (about 50 according to
GELEI, which matches the lower limit of our specimens). Thus, only one firm feature remains,
viz., the number of ciliary rows (16-18 vs. 33-50). This matches the narrower length:width

ratio (4:1 vs. 2.5:1) making, on average, B. lingua multistriatum distinctly broader than B.
lingua lingua. On the other hand, GELEI (1934) observed only two, possibly under-developed
specimens. Thus, little is known about variability, although the low number of ciliary rows
strongly suggests that B. lingua lingua is indeed more slender than B. lingua multistriatum.
Considering this incomplete knowledge and the similarities mentioned above, subspecies than
species rank is likely appropriate for our population.

Bryophyllumpenardi KAHL, 1931 (Fig. 80a-v; 318i, j, 333i; Table 65)
1922 Loxophyllum armatum CLAP, et LACHM. 1859 — PENARD, Infusoires, p. 74.
1931 Bryophyllum penardi KAHL, Tierwelt Dtl., 21: 185.
1934 Bryophyllum spathidioides GELEI, Arch. Protistenk., 81: 206 (new synonym).
Synonymy: KAHL (1931b) recognized that PENARD'S species is different from
Loxophyllum armatum CLAPAREDE & LACHMANN, 1859, and thus described it as a species
novum, Bryophyllum penardi. We agree. However, KAHL (1931b) also mentioned that B.
penardi is rather similar to B. tegularum, which he established in the same paper, differing
mainly by the left side, which is barren in B. penardi and ciliated in B. tegularum. GELEI
(1934) described B. spathidioides, but mentioned that it is so similar to B. penardi that "ich
die Art überhaupt als provisorisch betrachten möchte". Indeed, the six distinguishing features
provided by GELEI are indistinct or highly variable, according to our data, except of the
ciliated/unciliated left side (see above). However, it is now clear that all Bryophyllum species
350

have both sides ciliated and PENARD'S statement likely was influenced by the generic
misplacement, viz., Loxodes, whose left side indeed lacks ordinary cilia. Likewise, the
second, subequatorial dorsal brush described by GELEI (1934) in his four Bryophyllum species
must be a misobservation because we did not find it in the four species we investigated (this
paper and FOISSNER 1984).
Accordingly, the present state of knowledge can be summarized as follows: Bryophyllum
penardi, B. tegularum, and B. spathidioides cannot be distinguished by their original
descriptions, if the pronounced variability the species of this genus have is taken into account
(see descriptions in this book). However, if our identification and neotypification is accepted,
Bryophyllum tegularum and B. penardi are distinct species differing in an important feature,
viz., the number of dorsal brush rows: three vs. six to eight. By contrast, reliable distinguish-
ing features are lacking in B. penardi and B. spathidioides, suggesting synonymy.
Neotype material: Neotypified from Madagascan population, according to reasons 1-4,
6 in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 140 x 45 urn in vivo; slenderly to broadly lanceolate
with posterior end of oral bulge in last dorsal sixth of cell and distinctly set off from body
proper. Macronucleus about 100 urn long and more or less tortuous. Two types of scattered
extrusomes: type I acicular and about 6 x 0.8 urn in size; type II rod-shaped and 1.5 urn long.
On average 23 ciliary rows, about 6 of them anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush.
Description of Madagascan neotype population (Fig. 80a-g, n-t; 318i, j):
Size 100-160 x 30-70 um in vivo, usually near 140 x 45 um, prepared cells rather strongly
shrunken (Table 65); length:width ratio highly variable, viz. 1.5-4.1, on average 2.9:1 in
protargol preparations; highly flexible, but not contractile. Shape as typical for genus, but
rather variable, that is, slenderly to broadly lanceolate depending on food supply, frequently
Trithigmostoma-\ike, but with beak dorsally; anterior quarter and ventral cell margin leaf-like
flattened and thus hyaline, central and posterior region usually dark at low magnification (<
xlOO) and only slightly flattened because packed with food inclusions (Fig. 80a-d, n, s).
Nuclear apparatus in middle body third. Macronucleus on average about 100 urn long and
more or less distinctly C-shaped or tortuous, contains many small, globular nucleoli.
Micronucleus attached or near macronucleus in variable positions, discoidal. Contractile
vacuole with about 15 excretory pores subterminal near left dorsal margin of cell. Two types
of extrusomes scattered in oral bulge and cytoplasm, do not impregnate with the protargol
method used (Fig. 80a, g, p-r; 318i, j): type I conspicuous because acicular and about 6 x 0.8
urn in size, produces distinct ventral fringe; type II very inconspicuous, rod-shaped, fine,
about 1.5 urn long. Cortex highly flexible, contains about 10 rows of minute (0.3 um)
granules between each two kineties; rows oblique and composed of slightly larger granules in
oral bulge cortex (Fig. 80e, f). Cytoplasm colourless, in well-fed specimens packed with fat
globules up to 10 urn across and food vacuoles containing flagellates (Peranema), ciliates,
and rotifers (Fig. 80a). Glides slowly on microscope slide and debris showing great flexi-
bility.
Cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, rather loosely spaced in anterior and posterior region of cell,
leaving blank a small area along left posterior portion of oral bulge, arranged in an average of
23 rows following body curvature and abutting to both halves of circumoral kinety anteriorly
and posteriorly; some rows interrupted and/or shortened anteriorly and/or posteriorly without
any regularity. On average six left side kineties anteriorly differentiated to inconspicuous dorsal

brush composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids bearing slightly inflated, 2-3 urn long bristles;
kineties increase in length from right to left, and the last row has a monokinetidal bristle tail
extending to mid-body (Fig. 80a, n, s, t; Table 65). We did not find any ciliary specialisations
in mid-body, as described by GELEI (1934).
Oral apparatus occupies entire body length and curves around posterior end onto dorsal side
for an average of 18 urn in protargol preparations (Table 65). Oral bulge rather flat, but about
10 urn wide anteriorly and 5 urn posteriorly, glossy due to the many extrusomes contained,
and thus conspicuous in vivo. Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, very elongate cuneate,
composed of dikinetids each associated with a cilium and a nematodesma decreasing in
length from anterior to posterior; dikinetids so closely spaced in anterior body half that their
cilia form a membranoid structure. Oral basket rods distinct only in anterior body third, where
they form long bundles (Fig. 80a, f, g, n, p, s-v; Table 65).
Namibian population (Fig. 80u, v; 333i; Table 65): The Namibian site (49) specimens
were also studied in detail and analyzed morphometrically. The general organization and the
ciliary pattern are very similar to the Madagascan specimens, and are thus not shown.
However, the Namibian specimens are considerably larger and broader than those from
Madagascar, and thus have more ciliary and dorsal brush rows. Some additional observations
from protargol-impregnated specimens: (i) Shape rather constant, flattened ventral margin
without undulations; (ii) The short type II extrusomes impregnate heavily, producing a
conspicuous black stripe in the oral bulge (Fig. 80v; 333i); (iii) Feeds mainly on the ciliate
Epistylis alpestris; (iv) Oral bulge very flat, that is, only ~ 2 \im high; (v) Circumoral cilia
about 15 urn long.
Occurrence and ecology: PENARD (1922) discovered this species in a Swiss
Sphagnum pond, and described in detail the ingestion of a rotifer. GELEI (1934) found only
few specimens of B. spathidioides in a eutrophic pond in Hungary; in the laboratory
aquarium, they survived at 27-29° C, but obviously did not, or only slowly reproduce. We
found B. penardi in Madagascar (Nosy Be Island, brown leaves from a streamlet in the rain
forest, pH 6.1; sample kindly provided by Gerd STEINBERG, Kiel, in 1988) and at Namibian
site (49), that is, in the mud of astatic pools. These records show that B. penardi likely is a
limnetic cosmopolitan, possibly preying mainly rotifers and ciliates.
Identification and comparison with related species: The Madagascan
neotype matches PENARD'S original description almost perfectly, even in the size and shape of
the extrusomes ("Trichocystes 6 um et sont en forme de baguettes courtes, tres legerement
recourbees."), hardly leaving any doubt about conspecificity; only the oral bulge is slightly
shorter dorsally which is, however, of minor importance because it is a highly variable feature
(~ 30%, Table 65). Likewise, our specimens match B. spathidioides GELEI (1934), especially
those from Namibia, which are considerably larger than those from Madagascar, and thus
have slightly more ciliary and dorsal brush rows (Table 65). However, size is highly variable
in Bryophyllum and thus of minor importance.
Bryophyllum penardi is highly similar to B. tegularum KAHL, 1931b, as redescribed by FRYD-
VERSAVEL et al. (1975) and FOISSNER (1984), except of the dorsal brush, which comprises six
to eight rows in the former and three rows in the latter, an important difference, as explained
above. Further, the macronucleus is nodulated only in B. tegularum. —> Bryophyllum
paucistriatum is, on average, distinctly smaller than B. penardi and thus has much fewer
kineties (11-15 vs. 23-28 in two populations each) and dorsal brush rows (4-6 vs. 5-11).
355

Further, the oral bulge extrusomes are rod-shaped to slightly acicular and arranged in distinct
rows in B. paucistriatum, while conspicuously acicular and scattered in B. penardi. Accord-
ingly, only extreme specimens might pose identification problems.
DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) described a "Bryophyllum spathidioides GELEI,
1933" from a pond near Cotonou, Benin (Africa). With a length of 180-220 urn and a
boomerang-shaped macronucleus, it is obviously very similar to our Namibian population.
Unfortunately, DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) do not provide details on the ciliary
pattern and extrusomes, but mention that the ciliate highly resembles B. penardi and the
identification as B. spathidioides is provisional.

Apobryophyllum vermiforme nov. spec. (Fig. 81a-o; Table 66)
Diagnosis: Size about 220 x 20 urn in vivo; narrowly lanceolate to linear. Macronucleus
filiform and indistinctly nodulated, about 100 urn long. Micronuclei conspicuously slender,
viz., 5 x1 urn on average. Extrusomes rod-shaped and very fine, about 5 x 0.2 urn. On
average 9 ciliary rows (including circumoral kinety), those on left and dorsal side anteriorly
differentiated to complex, three-rowed brush.
Type location: Highly saline terrestrial material from the dry bed of the Löwen River
about 100 m downstream the Nautedam, Namibia, 26°55'S 17°55'E (site 8 in figure 2 and
chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective vermiforme (worm-like) refers to the slender shape.
Description: Protargol impregnation did not work well, and thus the type slides are
mediocre. Indeed, they look unusable at first glance because they are rather opaque and dark
due to the cortical granules, which impregnated heavily. However, closer inspection reveals
that the cilia are well-impregnated and show details of the dorsal brush with perfect clarity.
Size about 130-310 x 10-30 fxm in vivo, usually about 220 x 20 fim, as calculated from
measurements of live specimens and values shown in table 66, smallest cells might be post-
dividers; length:width ratio 6.8-19.3:1, on average near 11:1 both in vivo and protargol
preparations; slightly to up to 3:1 flattened laterally and then often sigmoidally twisted about
main body axis; very flexible, but acontractile. Outline narrowly lanceolate to linear, anterior
ventral side curved dorsally and bluntly pointed, posterior end narrowly rounded, usually
widest in mid-body (Fig. 81a, e-g, m-o). Macronucleus in central body portion, about 100
urn long and indistinctly moniliform, somewhat tortuous in one third of specimens; nucleoli
globular to lobate, depending on specimen. Micronuclei along and near macronuclear strand,
about 5x1 jam and thus conspicuously slender showing a variety of shapes, viz., fusiform,
lanceolate, or elongate ellipsoidal (Fig. 81a, i, n). Contractile vacuole in posterior body end,
excretory pores not recognizable in the preparations. Extrusomes about 5 x 0.2 urn, that is,
very fine, recognizable only under interference contrast illumination in strongly flattened
specimens; thus, and because they did not impregnate with the protargol method used, we
could not recognize their location, except in the anterior portion of the oral bulge; the great
number indicates that they might be arranged as in —> A. etoschense; released extrusomes
about 10 urn long and of typical toxicyst structure (Fig. 81a, b, h). Cortex very flexible,
contains innumerable, 0.3 um-sized granules in closely spaced rows, which usually impreg-
nate with protargol. Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to many fat globules 3-5 urn across.
Creeps slowly, winding like a nematode.
Cilia 8-9 urn long in vivo, arranged in an average of seven equidistant, loosely ciliated rows
plus the right and left branch of the circumoral kinety, which are indistinguishable from
ordinary ciliary rows in mid-body. Dorsal brush at anterior end of three dorsal and left lateral
kineties, short, composed of pairs of bristles somewhat inflated distally, anterior bristles of
rows 1 and 2 slightly longer than posterior ones. Brush row 1 composed of 2-3 urn long
bristles interspersed between ordinary somatic cilia, a specific feature also found in —> A.
etoschense. Brush row 2 slightly longer than rows 1 and 3, composed of up to 6 (im long
bristles decreasing in length anteriorly and posteriorly. Brush row 3 similar as row 2, but with

a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to second third of cell (Fig. 81a, d, h, k, m; Table 66).
Oral bulge extends on whole ventral surface, hardly set off from body proper, in vivo distinct
only in anterior third of cell, in protargol preparations occasionally rather conspicuous
because the cortical bulge granules impregnate somewhat differently (Fig. 81o); about 5 um
high and wide anteriorly, decreasing to 2-3 um posteriorly; bulge surface arrowhead-like
patterned (Fig. 81a, c, f, h). Circumoral dikinetids comparatively widely spaced, even in
anterior body third, each kinetid associated with an about 9 urn long cilium and a fine
nematodesma recognizable only in anterior body portion; oral basket thus inconspicuous and
visible only in protargol preparations (Fig. 81j, k, n, o).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rather
numerous, but disappeared after collecting the soil percolate for protargol preparation. As this
is a dry river bed, we cannot decide whether A. vermiforme is a terrestrial or limnetic species.
As yet, we found ciliates of this type only in soils from Kenya and Namibia, which indicates a
restricted geographic distribution.

b Including circumoral kinety, which is indistinguishable from ordinary ciliary rows in mid-body.
Comparison with related species: Apobryophyllum vermiforme is a distinct
species easily distinguished from —> A. etoschense FOISSNER, 1998b (size 220 x 20 urn vs.
130 x 30 urn; macronucleus filiform vs. reniform; extrusomes conspicuous vs. almost
invisible; 16 vs. 9 ciliary rows) and A. terricola FOISSNER, 1998a (size 220 x 20 urn vs. 160 x
360

25 um; extrusomes rather distinct vs. almost invisible; micronuclei slender vs. globular; 16
vs. 9 ciliary rows; three vs. four brush kineties, with rightmost brush row(s) of different fine
structure).
However, there is another terricolous ciliate, viz. Arcuospathidium vlassaki FoiSSNER, 2000d,
which highly resembles A. vermiforme in body size and shape, number of ciliary rows, and
structure of the nuclear apparatus, including the slender micronuclei. Fortunately, A. vlassaki
has conspicuous, oblanceolate extrusomes, and can thus be distinguished from A. vermiforme
even in vivo; in protargol preparations, the different shape of the circumoral kinety is a
reliable marker.
Apobryophyllum etoschense FOISSNER, 1998 (Fig. 82a-o; 333a-h; Table 67)
As the original description (FoiSSNER 1998b) was carelessly edited, we repeat the description.
Diagnosis: Size about 130x30 urn in vivo; spatulous. Macronucleus reniform. Two types
of extrusomes in oral bulge and somatic cortex, where they form minute bundles arranged to
about 10 distinct, longitudinal rows: type I fusiform and 5 urn long; type II rod-shaped and 3
urn long. On average 16 somatic kineties, those of left side anteriorly differentiated to
complex dorsal brush.
Type location: Soil from margin {Sporobolus grass girdle) of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°S
16°E (site 60 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the area discovered.
Description: Size 100-160 x 25-45 urn in vivo, usually about 130 x 30 urn, as calculated
from measurements of live specimens and values shown in table 67, assuming a shrinkage of
10-15% due to the preparation procedures; length.width ratio 3:1-6:1, on average 4.3:1.
Spatulous to broadly knife-shaped, that is, anterior ventral half distinctly curved and gradually
narrowing to form bluntly pointed, slightly projecting dorsal anterior end: blade flattened
leaf-like and thus hyaline, slightly broadened; handle evenly rounded posteriorly and
unflattened in mid-portion, cells thus fusiform in ventral and dorsal view (Fig. 82a, d, e, h, n;
333a). Macronucleus subequatorial in posterior body half, reniform in 75%, dumb-bell-
shaped in 10%, spiralized in 10%, and irregular in 5% of specimens (n = 20). Several
micronuclei attached to macronucleus, about 3 urn across in vivo, difficult to distinguish from
globular-fat-inclusions_in_protargol preparations. Contractile yacuole in .posterior end, about
four excretory pores in midline of right posterior surface (Fig. 82a, e). Two types of extru-
somes (type I slightly fusiform and about 5 urn long, type II rod-shaped and about 3 urn long;
both impregnate with silver carbonate and protargol, but shape and size differences become
indistinct) in oral bulge and somatic cortex, where they form about 10 distinct, longitudinal
rows each composed of small extrusome bundles contained in minute warts (Fig. 82a, b, i, j;
333b, c, g, h); released extrusomes about 20 urn long and of typical toxicyst structure (Fig.
333c). Cortex flexible, contains about six rows of colourless granules (about 1 x 0.3 urn)
between each two ciliary rows (Fig. 333o, p). Cytoplasm usually packed with colourless
globular and irregular fat inclusions 1-7 urn across, which often impregnate with protargol
making cells very opaque. Feeds on ciliates, e.g., Colpoda inflata. Glides slowly on
microscope slide and soil particles.

Cilia about 10 um long, loosely spaced, especially in anterior body third, arranged in
equidistant, meridional rows distinctly separate from circumoral kinety (Fig. 82a, e, f). Dorsal
brush at anterior end of left lateral kineties, about as long as blade of knife (1/3 body length;
Table 67), complex, that is, composed of cilia of different length (anterior cilia of dikinetids
1-2 urn, posterior 3-4 urn long) and shape (clavate or rod-shaped), as shown in figures 82k-n
and 333d-f: leftmost two rows at dorsal margin of cell, of "usual" haptorid structure, last row
extends with single, rod-shaped bristles to almost posterior body end; in rows 1-5, dikinetidal
bristles irregularly alternate with ordinary somatic cilia; anterior basal body of dikinetids
smaller than posterior (Fig. 82 1).
Oral bulge 2-3 urn thick throughout and thus inconspicuous in live specimens (Fig. 82h),
hardly distinct from body proper in posterior half, extends from anterior dorsal to posterior
dorsal end, where it forms a small but distinct notch filled with extrusomes (Fig. 82a, b, e, f;
333a, b, e, h). Circumoral kinety at base of oral bulge, composed of dikinetids having only
one (anterior?) basal body ciliated; dikinetids associated with fine nematodesmata and more
closely spaced in anterior than posterior half of kinety (Fig. 82e, f, g, k).

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location and a site nearby, that
is, slightly to highly saline soil from the SporobolusSuaeda girdle surrounding the Pan.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: Apobryo-
phyllum etoschense matches the genus diagnosis rather well: "Spathidiidae with oral bulge
extending to and around posterior end of organism. Dorsal brush on anterior left side of cell,
left brush kineties regular and dikinetidal, right brush kineties fragmented and very likely
monokinetidal (FOISSNER 1998a)". However, the structure of the dorsal brush is obviously
slightly different. Whether this is of generic or subgeneric significance must await the
discovery of further, related species.

No species has been found in the literature which might be identical to A. etoschense. It is
easily distinguished from A. terricola FOISSNER, 1998a by the macronucleus (reniform vs.
filiform) and, in silver slides, by the structure of the dorsal brush. Apobryophyllum
vermiforme is much more slender (11:1 vs. 4.3:1) and has a filiform macronucleus, very fine
extrusomes, and only three dorsal brush rows. The particular arrangement of the extrusomes
and the brush structure are highly reminiscent of Prorodon armatides, a freshwater species
with a small, anteriorly located oral opening (FOISSNER 1997b). Live specimens of A.
etoschense are easily confused with medium-sized and large Arcuospathidium species, for
instance, —> A. cultriforme lionotiforme, which have a similar shape and nuclear apparatus.
The best in vivo character for separating these species is the arrangement of the extrusomes,
which are restricted to the oral bulge in Arcuospathidium and distributed in a peripheral girdle
in Apobryophyllum.
Apobryophyllum terricola FOISSNER, 1998 (Fig. 83a-h; 328j-m)
Observations on Namibian populations: (i) Size in vivo about 200 x 40
(site_49) and 200 x 35 urn (site 5f3), thus stouter (5-5.7:1) than type specimens (7.3:1); (ii)
Macronucleus of site (49) specimens considerably shorter, especially in the young culture,
than in Kenyan type (Fig. 83a, h); (iii) Extrusomes of site (49) specimens distinctly fusiform
(Fig. 83e; 328k-m), while rod-shaped in type and Namibian site (56) specimens which,
additionally, likely lack dorsal extrusome rows and have a second extrusome type, viz. 1-1.5
jxm long rods, similar to —> A. etoschense; (iv) Dorsal brush of site (49) specimens usually as
in Kenyan type (Fig. 83a, b), rarely similar to that of -> A. etoschense (Fig. 83g, i; 328j).
FOISSNER (1998a) described a "conspicuous peripheral extrusome fringe" in A. terricola, and
rows of extrusome bundles in —> A. etoschense (FOISSNER 1998b). Careful in vivo observa-
tions on specimens from Namibian site (49) showed that A. terricola also has the extru-
somes arranged in about six rows, but not in bundles (Fig. 83c). Likely, extrusome rows are an

additional generic feature of Apobryophyllum. FOISSNER (1998a) suggested that both basal
bodies of the circumoral dikinetids are ciliated in the right half of the circumoral kinety of A.
terricola. However, this could be not confirmed by detailed in vivo observations on site (49)
specimens, which show that each circumoral dikinetid has only one cilium (Fig. 328j).
All these new observations show that Apobryophyllum terricola is rather variable and thus
more difficult to distinguish from —» A. etoschense than stated by FOISSNER (1998b).
However, both are still "good" species differing considerably in many features, such as body
size (on average 160 x 25 urn vs. 130 x 30 urn in vivo), body shape (5-7.3:1 vs. 4.2:1 on
average), macronucleus (usually long and tortuous vs. short and reniform), extrusomes (rows
vs. rows of bundles; one type vs. two types, but see above), somatic ciliary pattern (with vs.
without blank stripe between circumoral kinety and left side ciliature; Fig. 83a, i), and dorsal
brush details (with vs. without somewhat irregularly arranged monokinetids).
Dileptus breviproboscis FOISSNER, 1981 (Fig. 84a-m; Table 68)
Material: Soil from a floodplain rain forest of an island in the Amazon River, Brazil.
Improved diagnosis (contains original and present data): Size usually 140-160 x 14-
18 urn in vivo. Slenderly fusiform with both ends bluntly pointed, proboscis occupies about
23% of body length. Two ellipsoidal to distinctly spiral macronuclear segments with a
globular micronucleus in between. Usually a series of 4-6 contractile vacuoles in dorsal side
of trunk. Two types of extrusomes, viz., 3-4 urn long, fine rods and thick, oval to rod-shaped
organelles with a size of 2-3 x 1 urn. On average 9-10 ciliary rows, 2 anteriorly differentiated
to inconspicuous dorsal brush with up to 4 urn long bristles. Preoral kineties orientated almost
in parallel to circumoral kinety, each composed of two cilia.
Description of Brazilian site (30) population: Size 120-220 x 15-25 urn in
vivo, usually near 160 x 18 um; length.width ratio highly variable, viz., 7-14:1, on average
9-10:1 in protargol preparations (Table 68); not or slightly flattened laterally. Shape
inconspicuous because of the short proboscis and the lacking tail, usually slenderly fusiform
with both ends gradually narrowed and bluntly pointed; posterior end occasionally rather
broadly rounded, providing cells with a cylindroidal outline; proboscis short, that is, occupies
only 22% of body length on average (Fig. 84a, c, j-m; Table 68). Nuclear apparatus in middle
third of cell, invariably composed of two macronuclear segments with a globular to slightly
ellipsoidal micronucleus in between; rarely specimens, likely reorganizers, with two
macronuclear groups each composed of four to six globular nodules occur. Shape of
macronuclear segments varies from ellipsoidal to conspicuously spiral; nucleoli globular to
irregularly lobate (Fig. 84a, c, j, k, m). Three to six, usually four small contractile vacuoles
each with one to three excretory pores in dorsal cortex of trunk; never in proboscis; occasion-
ally, a pair of contractile vacuoles each occur near anterior and posterior end of trunk. Two
types of extrusomes in oral bulge: type I rod-shaped and fine, 3-4 x < 0.5 ^m, numerous also
in cytoplasm; type II conspicuously thick, viz., 2-3 x 1 urn and shell-shaped to ovate in
Brazilian site (30) specimens, while rod-shaped in Brazilian site (28) individuals, less
numerous than type I and restricted to oral bulge (Fig. 84a-f). Cortex very flexible, contains
rows of colourless granules about 0.3 urn across. Cytoplasm colourless, contains many 0.5-5um-

sized fat globules and food vacuoles with compact or loose content up to 7 urn in diameter.
Swims and glides rather rapidly showing great flexibility among soil particles.
Somatic and oral cilia 7-8 urn long in vivo, show the same curious impregnation attribute as
in other species of the genus, that is, have a thick, heavily impregnated distal half; somatic
basal bodies associated with conspicuous (postciliary?) fibres obliquely extending backwards
on right side of kineties (Fig. 84i). Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged,
leave blank a rather broad stripe each right and left of oral bulge; two of them anteriorly
differentiated to inconspicuous dorsal brush having about 4 urn long, distally slightly inflated
bristles anteriorly, decreasing in length to 2 urn posteriorly, both rows continue to anterior
trunk portion with a tail of 1-2 urn long, monokinetidal bristles; row 1 commences subapi-
cally and is posteriorly slightly longer than row 2, which commences apically (Fig. 84a, h-j,
m).
Oral apparatus as in congeners, proboscis, however, conspicuously short, occupying on
average only 22% of body length. Oral opening elliptical, indistinctly set off from body
proper, supported by an outer and inner rod basket. Preoral kineties, each composed of only
two cilia, difficult to recognize because arranged almost in parallel with circumoral kinety
(Fig. 84a,c,i,j).

Occurrence and ecology: The population described occurred in the same sample as
-» Phialinides armatus, that is, in soil from a floodplain rainforest of an island in the Amazon
River. However, we found highly similar populations also in soils from Costa Rica, the USA,
and Namibia, indicating a wide ecological range and cosmopolitan distribution.
Comparison with original description and related species: FOISSNER
(1984) synonymized D. breviproboscis with D. anguillula KAHL, 1932 because of transitions
in body shape and nuclear pattern. However, over the years we recognized that there are two
D. anguillula-like species, highly similar in all features except for the extrusomes: fine, 3-4
urn long rods vs. thick, 2-3 x 1 um-sized ellipsoids plus fine, 3-4 \im long rods (Fig. 84a-f).
Both species likely have cosmopolitan distribution: the former was found in Austria, Canada,
and Brazil, like the latter, which occurred in the USA, Costa Rica, Brazil, and Namibia.
Unfortunately, the original descriptions of D. anguillula and D. breviproboscis lack detailed
data about the extrusomes. Thus, they cannot be assigned to any of the two types described
above, but must be redefined. We suggest endowing D. anguillula with fine, rod-shaped
extrusomes, while D. breviproboscis additionally has thick, ellipsoidal extrusomes. A detailed
redescription of D. anguillula is in FOISSNER (1984). Alternatively, the Brazilian population
described here as D. breviproboscis might be considered as a new species and D. brevi-
proboscis kept in synonymy with D. anguillula. This, however, would unnecessarily increase
the number of insufficiently described species.
Dileptus orientalis SONG, PACKROFF & WlLBERT, 1988_also belongs to the D. anguillula
group. However, it is considerably larger (150-250 urn, x = 192) and has 15-19 (x = 16.7)
ciliary rows, of which three are differentiated to dorsal brush rows. Note that SONG et al.
(1988) illustrated the proboscis longer than it is, as evident from the morphometric data.
Thus, the species seemingly looks rather different to D. anguillula and D. breviproboscis.
Nevertheless, D. orientalis is a "good" species for the differences mentioned above.
Dileptus mucronatus PENARD, 1922 (Fig. 85a-o; 334a-p, 335a-j, 336i; Table 69)
Supplementary observations: This species, which is well-known since the
thorough redescription by FOISSNER (1984), is the most common middle-sized Dileptus in
soils world-wide and occurs also in Namibia (Table 4). Later, FoiSSNER's redescription was
confirmed on a Chinese population (SONG 1994). Our observations on a population from a
rice field soil in TaxaSozx (sample kindly provided by Mag. Hubert BLATTERER) largely agree
with those from the Austrian (FOISSNER 1984) and Chinese (SONG 1994) specimens. Thus, a
full redescription is not necessary. However, we provide several additional observations,
morphometric data, and a multitude of figures showing details as yet unknown or documented
only by line drawings.
(i) Dileptus mucronatus is defined by the following combination of features: middle-sized,
length 250-500 urn; rather distinct tail; two macronuclear segments with a single micro-
nucleus in between; a dorsal row of contractile vacuoles; two size-types of basically rod-
shaped extrusomes; 20-30 ciliary rows, of which about eight are anteriorly modified to dorsal
brush rows; and an ordinary oral basket (Fig. 85a-c; 334d-i, 1, 335a, d).

(ii) PENARD (1922) described the extrusomes as "courts et serres". FOISSNER (1984) described
them as "rod-shaped, about 7 urn long, and serially arranged in the oral bulge and scattered in
the cytoplasm". As the extrusomes are one of the main features of Dileptus species, we
studied them in nine populations from all over the world (Fig. 85g-n) and in a population
collected from the same area (Austria, Burgenland) as that studied by FOISSNER (1984). This
showed that FOISSNER (1984) recognized only the large extrusomes but overlooked the small
ones (Fig. 85o; 334a, b, 1). Taking all populations, the large, slightly asymmetrical extru-
somes are rod-shaped to slenderly lanceolate and 5-8 urn long, mostly 6-7 urn (Fig. 85g-i,

k-o; 334a, b, d-h); only those of Kenyan population II are distinctly lanceolate (Fig. 85j),
indicating that it could be a concrete subspecies. The small extrusomes are rod-shaped and 2-
4 urn long, usually 2.5-3 urn (Fig. 85a, g-o; 334b, h, i). Accordingly, the extrusomes of D.
mucronatus are fairly constant in shape and size and thus an important feature for species
identification. The real value of this feature, which is largely under-estimated, becomes
obvious on comparison of the micrographs of the rod-shaped extrusomes of D. mucronatus
(Fig. 334d-h) with, e.g., the clavate extrusomes of D. armatus (Fig. 49a-e in FoiSSNER
2000a). One of two Venezuelan populations studied has extrusomes only in the right half of
the bulge.
(iii) The about eight dorsal brush rows form a staggered pattern. Anteriorly, they consist of
pairs of distinctly inflated, 2-3 urn long bristles. More posteriorly, only the anterior bristle is
inflated while the posterior is rod-shaped and shorter. At the end of the rows are minute,
monokinetidal bristles (Fig. 85c, e; 335e, f, i, j).
(iv) The circumoral and preoral cilia form nice metachronal waves, as previously described
from light microscopic observations (Fig. 335b, g).
(v) The resting cysts of a cultivated Kenyan population (that with the deviating extrusomes,
Fig. 85j) are spherical to slightly ellipsoidal, have an average diameter of 60 urn, and are
surrounded by a conspicuous mucous layer, which sometimes contains extruded cyst material
(Fig. 334m-p; Table 69). The cysts are conspicuously honey-yellow/brown because the about
2 urn thick cyst wall has this colour, which is clearly recognizable in squashed cysts. Thus,
the resting cysts of D. mucronatus are very similar to those of A margaritifer, as described
by FOISSNER et al. (1994).

Neotype material: Neotypified from Namibian site (70) population, according to
reasons 1, 2, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 800 x 65 urn in vivo. Slenderly fusiform with both
ends gradually narrowed and bluntly pointed, proboscis occupies about 30% of body length.
Macronucleus moniliform and tortuous, composed of 47 segments on average. Many
contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk and proximal half of proboscis. Two size types of
rod-shaped extrusomes, large type about 10 urn long, small approximately 3 urn. On average
44 ciliary rows, up to 15 differentiated to dorsal brush anteriorly.
Redescription: Size of Mediterranean type population 400-1000 urn, of Namibian
neotype population 550-1100 x 50-85 urn, usually about 800 x 65 urn in vivo, as calculated
373

from some measurements of live specimens and values shown in table 70, assuming a
shrinkage of about 15% due to the preparation procedures. Length:width ratio also considera-
bly variable, namely, 8.3-19.3:1, usually 12.6:1; trunk circular in cross section, while
proboscis and rear portion distinctly laterally flattened. Shape slenderly fusiform with both
ends gradually narrowed and bluntly pointed; proboscis very slender, occupies 25-36%,
usually 30% of body length (Fig. 86a, m, n; Table 70). Macronucleus in trunk, moniliform
and tortuous, composed of an average of 47 usually ellipsoidal segments in Namibian
specimens, while of only eleven in those from Spain, as estimated from illustration in
MASSUTI ALZAMORA (1929); nucleoli numerous and spherical (Fig. 86a, m). Several globular
micronuclei adjacent to macronucleus. Many contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk and
proximal half of proboscis; no ventral vacuoles; excretory pores only occasionally recogniz-
able, up to three per contractile vacuole (Fig. 86a). Extrusomes accumulated in oral bulge,
especially in its right half, while lacking around pharyngeal basket, numerous and scattered in
cytoplasm, immature extrusomes impregnate with protargol; two shape and size types of
extrusomes attached to bulge of proboscis: type I slenderly rod-shaped with ends rounded,
slightly asymmetrical, about 10-12 x 0.7-1 urn; type II like type I but only 3-4 x 0.5-0.7 urn;
exploded extrusomes of typical toxicyst structure and with a refractive (toxin?) globule each
at proximal end of empty ampulla and tip, large type I up to 30 urn long, small type II up to 9
urn (Fig. 86c, d, h, i; 336b-h). Cortex very flexible, contains approximately seven rows of
about 1 x 0.5 um-sized granules (mucocysts?) between each two kineties. Cytoplasm
colourless, contains many glossy fat globules 1-5 urn across and some food vacuoles with
loose content, for instance, remnants of Condylostomides etoschensis, which is killed and
almost completely dissolved by exploding extrusomes before it is engulfed; usually one large
defecation vacuole in rear end. Movement without peculiarities, highly flexible.
Somatic and oral cilia about 7 urn long in protargol preparations, where they have a thick,
heavily impregnated distal half, as in other dileptids (—» Dileptus breviproboscis; Fig. 86k).
Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, anteriorly gradually shortened along
both sides of oral bulge, except for first kinety right of oral opening, which extends as perioral
kinety with closely spaced cilia parallel to circumoral kinety to tip of proboscis; leave blank a
rather wide stripe left of preoral kineties. Dorsal brush conspicuous, although bearing only
minute bristles, because occupying almost entire dorsal side of proboscis, where up to 15 left
lateral kineties are anteriorly differentiated to brush rows, forming a staggered pattern (Fig.
86g, j, 1; Table 70). Bristles clavate, paired and about 2-3 urn long in anterior portion of brush
rows, while single and approximately 1 urn long in posterior.
Oral apparatus as in —> Dileptus, that is, pharyngeal basket conspicuous, about 18 urn across,
and composed of an inner and outer basket. Circumoral kinety composed of dikinetids
orientated perpendicularly or slightly obliquely to kinety axis in proboscis, while possibly
consisting of monokinetids around pharyngeal opening. Many preoral kineties left of
circumoral kinety, counter-clockwise inclined, each usually composed of four closely spaced
basal bodies (Fig. 86g, 1).
Occurrence and ecology: MASSUTI ALZAMORA (1929) discovered the species in the
Bay of Palma de Mallorca, Island of Mallorca, Spain. We found it only at Namibian site (70),
that is, in highly saline soil and litter covered by a crust of cyanobacteria.

macronuclear configuration: Dileptus with dispersed nodules; Dimacrocaryon with two
nodules and a micronucleus in between; and Monilicaryon with moniliform macronucleus.
FoiSSNER's (1997b) reinvestigation of Dileptus monilatus, type of Monilicaryon, showed that
the same nuclear pattern evolved independently in several evolutionary lines of Dileptus s.l.
Based on this findings, he raised Monilicaryon to genus level and emended the diagnosis to
include features of the oral ciliature, viz., a perioral kinety each along right and left side of
circumoral kinety and the lack of preoral kineties. For species with a moniliform macro-
nucleus and an ordinary dileptid oral ciliature, FoiSSNER (1997b) established the genus
Pseudomonilicaryon. According to its oral ciliature, the Namibian population belongs to this
genus and is characterized by five conspicuous features, viz., the large body size (about 800
jam), the fusiform shape, the moniliform macronucleus with more than 40 segments, a dorsal
row of contractile vacuoles, and two size-types of rod-shaped extrusomes. There are only two
similar species, namely, Dileptus massutii KAHL, 1933 and D. grandis DRAGESCO, 1963 (Fig.
86n, o). Both have been described superficially (DRAGESCO 1963, KAHL 1933, MASSUTI
ALZAMORA 1929). As our population is from a saline habitat, we identify it with the marine
and similarly sized D. massutii. Likely, D. grandis is a junior synonym.

Pseudomonilicaryon japonicum nov. spec. (Fig. 87a-m; 337a-s; Table 71)
Diagnosis: Size about 400 x 75 urn in vivo. Fusiform with posterior end bluntly pointed,
proboscis occupies about 36% of body length. Macronucleus moniliform and tortuous,
composed of 28 segments on average. Many contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk and
proboscis, some ventrally. Two shape and size types of oral extrusomes: type I bluntly
acicular and about 6 urn long; type II rod-shaped and approximately 2 um long. On average
39 ciliary rows, up to 18 anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush. Oral opening circular.
Type location: Tree and soil mosses from the surroundings of the "Spring of Wisdom"
in Kyoto, Japan, 35°N 135°E.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size 260-580 x 50-105 urn in vivo, as calculated from some measurements
of live specimens and values shown in table 71, assuming a shrinkage of about 10% due to
the preparation procedures. Shape fusiform to broadly fusiform, rarely cylindroidal,
length:width ratio 3.8-8.4:1, on average 5.7:1 in protargol preparations; posterior end bluntly
pointed, rarely widely rounded or with inconspicuous, blunt tail due to a large egestion
vacuole in rear end; never with a tail sensu stricto. Proboscis occupies 22-55%, usually 36%
of body length, broad and flexible, usually conspicuously curved dorsally (Fig. 87a, d, g;
337a, b, h). Macronucleus in trunk, moniliform and tortuous, composed of an average of 28
segments easily recognizable even in vivo at low magnification; individual segments usually
ellipsoidal and with many small, globular nucleoli (Fig. 87a, d; 337g, 1; Table 71). Several
micronuclei adjacent to macronucleus, distinctly fusiform in vivo, while broadly fusiform,
ovoidal or globular in protargol preparations (we cannot exclude that "globular" is caused by
viewing a fusiform nucleus transversely). Contractile vacuoles numerous and conspicuous in
dorsal side of entire proboscis and trunk, where they form a rather broad stripe, while sparse
and thus easily overlooked in ventral side of trunk; each vacuole with one, rarely two circular
excretory pores (Fig. 87a, d, e; 337a, b, h, i, k-n). Extrusomes accumulated in oral bulge, but
not around and in oral opening, immature stages scattered in cytoplasm and impregnated with
protargol. Two shape and size types of ripe oral bulge extrusomes: type I bluntly acicular and
about 6 x 0.8 urn, type II rod-shaped and approximately 2 x 0.3 urn; exploded extrusomes of
typical toxicyst structure and with a globule (toxin droplet?) on top, large type I up to 16 urn
long, small type II up to 6 urn (Fig. 87a-c, h-k; 337c-f, g). Cortex very flexible, contains a
sheet of refractive, comparatively large (1 x 0.5 urn) granules (mucocysts?), forming about
seven oblique rows between each two kineties (Fig. 871, m; 337g, k). Cytoplasm colourless,
contains many fat globules 1-5 urn across, some 15 urn long pharyngeal baskets from ciliate
prey, and up to seven vacuoles with remnants of rotifers, the preferred food of this large
ciliate. Movement without peculiarities.
Somatic and oral cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, with thick, distal half in protargol-impreg-
nated specimens, as in congeners (FOISSNER 2000a). Ciliary rows meridionally and equi-
distantly arranged, anteriorly gradually shortened along both sides of oral bulge, except for
first kinety right of oral opening, which extends as so-called perioral kinety parallel to the
circumoral kinety to tip of proboscis; cilia much more closely spaced in preoral than postoral
portion of perioral kinety. Blank stripe left of preoral kineties rather wide. Dorsal brush
conspicuous, although bearing only minute bristles, because occupying almost entire dorsal

side of proboscis, where up to 18 left lateral kineties are differentiated to brush rows
anteriorly, forming a staggered pattern. Bristles rod-shaped, paired and 3-4 urn long in
anterior portion of brush rows, while single and about 1.5-2 urn long in posterior (Fig. 87d-f;
337a, b, h-j, m-s; Table 71).
Oral apparatus as in —» Dileptus, that is, conspicuous and composed of fine fibres forming an
inner and outer basket about 19 urn across; a single, SEM prepared specimen has an elliptical
basket opening and thus possibly belongs to another species. Circumoral kinety made of
dikinetids, while apparently composed of single granules around pharyngeal opening (for
details, see GRAIN & GOLINSKA 1969). Many preoral kineties left of circumoral kinety,
individual kineties counter-clockwise inclined and regularly spaced, except for some
irregularities distally, usually composed of three closely spaced basal bodies (Fig. 87c, d;
337o,p; Table 71).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, that is, in a slightly
acidic (pH 5.9) non-flooded Petri dish culture containing tree and soil mosses from the
surroundings of the "Spring of Wisdom" in Kyoto, Japan. Recently found in forest moss from
Venezuela, but with a shape rather similar to that of —> P. angustistoma, that is, with a short
tail.
Classification and comparison with similar species: This species is
affiliated to Pseudomonilicaryon FOISSNER, 1997b, according to its Dileptus-Wke oral
ciliature and the moniliform macronucleus (for genus discussion, see P. massutii). Pseudo-
monilicaryon japonicum highly resembles Dileptus falciformis KAHL, 1931b, but lacks the
pharyngeal extrusomes emphasized by KAHL (1931b). The pharyngeal extrusomes are a
special feature documented by micrographs in D. costaricanus FOISSNER, 1995. We consider
pharyngeal extrusomes as relevant at species level because we know of two further, un-
described species with the same feature, showing that such species comprise a distinct
evolutionary line.
According to DRAGESCO (1963) and FOISSNER (1997b), there are some other similarly sized
species with a moniliform macronucleus: Dileptus thononensis DRAGESCO, 1960 (with
distinct tail, 60-70 macronuclear segments, freshwater interstitial); Dileptus marinus KAHL,
1933 (450-700 urn, with distinct tail, marine); Dileptus cygnus (CLAPAREDE & LACHMANN,
1859) KAHL, 1931b (400-600 um, short and slender tail, proboscis usually distinctly longer
than trunk, freshwater); Monilicaryon monilatus (STOKES, 1886b) JANKOWSKI, 1967b (no
preoral kineties, usually 400-700 urn, with short tail).
Pseudomonilicaryon angustistoma nov. spec. (Fig. 88a-f; 338a—j; Table 71)
Diagnosis: Size about 400 x 35 urn in vivo. Fusiform with distinct tail, proboscis
occupies about 37% of body length. Macronucleus moniliform, composed of 18 segments on
average. Many contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk and proboscis. Two shape and size
types of oral extrusomes: type I acicular and about 6 urn long; type II rod-shaped and
approximately 2 urn long. On average 39 ciliary rows, up to 10 anteriorly differentiated to
dorsal brush. Oral opening distinctly elliptical (~ 25 x 10 urn).

Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Apposite noun composed of the Latin adjective angustus (narrow) and the
Greek noun stoma (mouth), meaning "the narrow-mouthed Pseudomonilicaryon", the main
feature of the species.
Description and comparison with related species: Pseudomonilicaryon
angustistoma is similar to —> P. japonicum, except for the more slender body (length:width
ratio 11.4:1 vs. 5.7:1, but about 8:1 in an Venezuelan population), a distinctly higher number
of macronuclear nodules (19 vs. 28), and the elliptical (vs. circular) oral opening (Fig. 88b, d;
338a; Table 71). Thus, the reader is referred to the description of—» P. japonicum and to the
detailed figures, figure explanations, and morphometrics of P. angustistoma.
The most important difference between P. angustistoma and other species, for instance,
Dileptus marinus, is the elliptical oral opening, a special feature resembling Dimacrocaryon
amphileptoides, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1984), and especially, Pelagodileptus
trachelioides, as reviewed by FOISSNER et al. (1999). Indeed, this pelagic species has
remarkable similarities (size, shape, macronuclear pattern) with Pseudomonilicaryon
angustistoma, but is distinctly stouter (5:1 vs. 11.4:1), has 120-200 ciliary rows (vs. 39), and
is usually packed with symbiotic green algae (zoochlorellae). For differentiation from other,
more distantly related species, see —» P. japonicum.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, but a similar or even
the same species occurs in Venezuela, South America. The slender body indicates that P.
angustistoma is a terrestrial species.
Actinobolina multinucleata nov. spec. (Fig. 89a-n; 339a-x, 340a-d; Table 72)
Diagnosis: Size about 85 x 55 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. An average of 22 macronuclear
nodules and 18 ciliary rows, each associated with about 8 tentacles.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective multinucleata (having many nuclei) refers to the
numerous macronuclear nodules, the main feature of the species.
Description: Size 70-100 x 40-70 urn in vivo, while distinctly shrunken and thus only
52-74 x 40-68 urn in protargol preparations. Well-nourished specimens ovoidal, rarely
obovoidal when swimming; ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal when floating; and elongate
ellipsoidal to cylindroidal under prolonged cover glass stay (Fig. 89a, b, i-1; 339a-f; Table
72). Transparent, undernourished specimens, as occurring in the old Petri dish culture and
used for studying the ciliary pattern, up to 2:1 flattened and with some long tentacles
posteriorly. Macronuclear nodules numerous, namely 22 on average, scattered, globular,
ellipsoidal or reniform; nucleoli globular. Two to eleven, usually five globular micronuclei
adjacent to macronuclear nodules (Fig. 89c, h; 339i-k; Table 72). Contractile vacuole
terminal, surrounded by contributory vesicles during diastole, with four to six excretory pores
383

in posterior pole area. Cortex basically almost smooth, but ribbed in optical section due to the
bulb-like structures formed by retracting and retracted tentacles; contains loosely spaced
granules about 0.4 urn across (Fig. 89b, g, h; 339f, h, k, q-s, w, x, 340a, c, d). Six to ten,
usually eight almost equidistant tentacles associated with each ciliary row; individual
tentacles usually at anterior left end of a small cluster of cilia and associated with a short fibre
(?) extending anteriad and a granule (microtubular array and/or extrusome tip?) recognizable
only in protargol preparations. Tentacles radially spread and up to 60 urn long in floating
specimens, while more or less withdrawn into body in swimming and disturbed cells forming
a conspicuous, ring-like array in mid-body; entrance of withdrawn tentacles into body proper
surrounded by a minute collar and/or small bulbs recognizable in the scanning electron
microscope; distal tentacle portion bent in rotating and tortuous in silver carbonate-impreg-
nated specimens. Extrusomes (toxicysts) in distal portion of tentacles, rod-shaped to slightly
capitate, about 11 x 0.8 urn and highly refractive in vivo; often curved in protargol prepara-
tions and occasionally with a lanceolate or rhomboidal tip in silver carbonate preparations
(Fig. 89a-h, m, n; 339a-g, i, k, m, o, r, t, v-x, 340a, b). Cells dark at low magnification due to
numerous fat globules, likely digested prey ciliates, such as Halteria grandinella occasionally
identified in the food vacuoles. Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis, floats
for long times with more or less extended tentacles and rather fast metachronal ciliary waves
when lurking for prey. Divides in freely motile (non-encysted) condition.
Ciliary rows equidistantly and meridionally to slightly spirally arranged, composed of 20-22
\ym long cilia scattered in circumoral area, while forming more or less large and distinct
clusters with tentacles postorally. Fine structure of individual clusters rather different in
protargol and silver carbonate preparations (Fig. 89d, g, m, n; 3391—r, v, 340b). Protargol
impregnation usually reveals some cilia forming a minute, slightly oblique row with a barren
granule each at its anterior left end and left posterior of the tentacle, which is associated with
a granule (microtubular array and /or extrusome tip?) and a short fibre (?); both granules hot
revealed by silver carbonate. Silver carbonate impregnation shows the ciliated basal bodies of
the clusters as conspicuous, minute rods likely composed of two granules, the right of which
is associated with a short, anteriorly extending structure (kinetodesmal fibre?); furthermore, a
minute, oblique structure (probably the support wall according to the TEM observations of
HOLT et al. 1973) often traverses or touches the anteriormost basal body complex producing
an argyrophilic accumulation at anterior end of cluster. Scattered circumoral basal bodies
smaller and more globular than those of clusters.
One tentacle-free, distinct dorsal brush row extends to rear quarter or fifth of cell and
continues as ordinary somatic kinety posteriorly; rarely, two long rows are present; composed
of single or paired, frequently slightly inflated bristles < 1-3 urn long; frequently, the anterior
portion of one or two adjacent ciliary rows also bears scattered or aligned bristles between
ordinary cilia and tentacles. Brush kinetids inconspicuous in silver carbonate preparations
because lacking fibrillar associates and globular, that is, not rod-shaped as the somatic
ordinary kinetids (Fig. 89d, g; 339m, q, s, u-x, 340c, d).
Oral opening in anterior pole centre, covered by an about 3 urn high bulge with a slight
central indentation (Fig. 89a, c, d, g; 339 1, p, u, v, 340b). Circumoral ciliary row at base of
oral bulge, composed of closely spaced, rather often somewhat irregularly arranged basal
bodies and surrounded by scattered, likely oralized somatic monokinetids associated with fine
nematodesmata in protargol preparations (minute, slightly oblique rows of 1-3 basal bodies
according to the TEM observations of HOLT et al. 1973); no fibrillar associates revealed by

silver carbonate impregnation. Oral basket conical, composed of many fine fibres and thus
hardly recognizable in vivo, while usually faintly impregnated with protargol; fine structure
likely as described in Belonophrya pelagica by FoiSSNER et al. (1999).
Occurrence and ecology: Basically, Actinobolina spp. are planktonic ciliates, but
occur also in small, ephemeral waters (DiNGFELDER 1962, FOISSNER et al. 1999). Thus, our
habitat, mud from ephemeral pools, is not exceptional. As yet, we found A. multinucleata
only in a sample from the type location, where it developed a few days after rewetting the
material and stayed for several weeks. However, well-nourished specimens occurred mainly
during the first couple of weeks. As the genus Actinobolina is comparatively well-known, the
Namibian species might have a restricted Palaeotropic or Gondwanan distribution.

Comparison with related species: The genus Actinobolina was revised by
FoiSSNER et al. (1999). Actinobolina multinucleata has all features of the genus and differs
from its congeners mainly by the number of macronuclear nodules: about 22 in A. multi-
nucleata; two in A. wenrichii WANG & NIE, 1933; and a long, tortuous strand in A. radians
(STEIN, 1867) STRAND, 1928, A. vorax (WENRICH, 1929) KAHL, 1930a, and A. smalli HOLT,
LYNN & CORLISS, 1973. Furthermore, Actinobolina wenrichii and A. smalli have symbiotic
algae. The descriptions of Actinöbolus rotundus12 and Actindbolus piriformis by ESCOMEL
12 STRAND (1928) established Actinobolina as replacement name for Actinöbolus STEIN, 1867, preoccupied by
a coleopteran genus.
387

(1929) are insufficient, especially due to the lack of illustrations. However, the author
mentions one large macronucleus in A. rotundus and a maximum body length of about 30 urn
in A. piriformis. Thus, both species are obviously not conspecific with our specimens, which
have many macronuclear nodules and measure 70-100 x 40-70 urn.
The genus Belonophrya, a close relative of Actinobolina, was resurrected by FOISSNER et al.
(1999), who redescribed the type species, Belonophrya pelagica. It differs distinctly from A.
multinucleata by the number of macronuclear nodules (1 vs. about 22). Additionally, it has
more ciliary rows (27 vs. 18) and lantern-shaped extrusomes in protargol preparations.
388

CYRTOPHORTOA
Cyrtophorida are rare in soil for unknown reasons, although some species are quite frequent,
especially in leaf litter (FOISSNER 1987(1, 1998a). In Namibia, we found only known species,
except of the new subspecies of Odontochlamys alpestris described below.
Odontochlamys CERTES, 1891
Improved diagnosis: Small to medium-sized Chilodonellidae with apical dorsal
brush. Ventral ciliary field depressed, composed of a left and right portion distinctly separated
by a blank stripe postorally. Ciliary rows of right field curved anteriorly. Dorsal hump large,
often projecting above ventral surface and conspicuously wrinkled, rarely rather regularly
serrated. Encystment fast and easily induced.
Type species: OdontochlamysgouraudiCERTES, 1891.
Comparison with related genera: KAHL (1931b), WENZEL (1953), BUITKAMP
(1977a), and DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) synonymized Odontochlamys
CERTES, 1891 with Chilodonella STRAND, 1928. Based on detailed investigations of the type
species and O. alpestris, FOISSNER (1981b, 1988b) resurrected the genus with an improved
diagnosis. The reinvestigation of O. convexa by BLATTERER & FOISSNER (1992) and O.
wisconsinensis by PETZ & FOISSNER (1997), as well as the new subspecies described here
support FoiSSNER's suggestion that the apical location of the dorsal brush is the most
important feature for distinguishing Odontochlamys and Chilodonella.
Odontochlamys alpestris FOISSNER, 1981
We split this species into two subspecies according to the number of dorsal brush cilia and
left field kineties. The improved diagnosis is based on the revision by FOISSNER et al. (1991)
and the original descriptions of a soil and a freshwater population (BLATTERER & FOISSNER
1-9-92, EOISSNER.1981b).
Improved diagnosis: Size about 40-50 x 20-30 urn in vivo; outline elliptical to
ovoidal, dorsal hump irregularly wrinkled. Right ciliary field with 5 rows, left with 5-7.
Dorsal brush composed of 2 or 3-9 cilia. Pharyngeal basket with about 8 rods.
Odontochlamys alpestris alpestris FOISSNER, 1981b nov. stat.
Diagnosis: Dorsal brush composed of 3-9, usually 4-7 cilia. Left ciliary field with 6-7
rows.
389

Locus classicus: Alpine grassland soil in the surroundings of the " Wallack-Haus" at the
Grossglockner-Hochalpenstrasse (Hohe Tauern, Austria).
Odontochlamys alpestris biciliata nov. sspec. (Fig. 90a-u; 341a-h; Table 73)
Diagnosis: Dorsal brush invariably composed of 2 cilia. Left ciliary field with 5 rows.
Type location: Highly saline soil from coast of Curacao Island at the north coast of
Venezuela, 12°N 71 °W.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin prefix bi (two) and adjective ciliatus (ciliated),
referring to the two dorsal brush cilia. Odontochlamys has feminine gender, not masculine as
stated by AESCHT (2001).
Description: Size highly variable, that is, 30-55 x 20-35 urn in vivo, usually about 40 x
25 urn, as calculated from measurements of live specimens and values shown in table 72,
assuming a length shrinkage of about 15% due to the preparation procedures. Shape complex
and rather variable (Fig. 90a, g, k-s; 341a). Outline elliptical in ventral and dorsal view, with
anterior left end bluntly pointed and posterior broadly rounded; distinctly dorsoventrally
flattened in preoral area (up to 8:1), while less so in vaulted postoral portion (about 1.7:1);
very flexible but acontractile, except for thin preoral portion, which contracts slightly when
specimens touch an obstacle. Ventral side with conspicuous postoral depression, left margin
straight to slightly sigmoidal, right distinctly convex. Dorsal side flattened in preoral portion,
while conspicuously vaulted in postoral, producing a bowl-shaped transverse view together
with the hollowed ventral side. Dorsal hump about 13% back from anterior body end,
conspicuous, distinctly set off from thin preoral region, elliptical, laterally usually projects
distinctly above ventral surface; numerous concentric, argyrophilic fibres extend on hump and
probably contract ventral side during encystment. Anterior hump region often with prominent
slope, occasionally with furrow parallel to anterior margin; mid-region frequently with short
furrow extending obliquely anteriad from left margin; posterior region occasionally with
some lobes. Macronucleus in variable position, broadly ellipsoidal, of centric heteromeric
type; peripheral orthomere composed of granules in vivo, while with several nucleoli about 1
urn across in protargol preparations, surrounds paramere with central, globular endosome.
Two globular macronuclei in two out of 30 specimens, of which one also has a macronuclear
anläge. Although no conjugants were seen in vivo and the preparations, a quarter of the
specimens had a macronuclear anläge, whose transformation to a new nucleus takes about 80
hours (PYNE et al. 1974); anläge in posterior body portion, broadly ellipsoidal and up to three
times larger than the ordinary macronucleus and thus very prominent, usually impregnates
more lightly and homogenously. Micronucleus in variable position, about 3 urn across and
surrounded by distinct membrane in vivo, frequently not impregnated with protargol (Fig.
90a, c, h, j; 341a, c). Two contractile vacuoles usually obliquely opposed; right vacuole 25-
37% (n = 4) back from anterior body end and slightly right of midline, left vacuole more
posteriorly, namely, 38-58% back from anterior end and near left body margin; excretory
pores recognizable neither in protargol nor KLEIN-FOISSNER silver nitrate preparations.
Cytoplasm finely granulated or opaque. Food vacuoles 3-4 urn across, optically empty or
containing bacterial remnants, especially spores. Glides rather quickly on large substrate

particles and microscope slide; sometimes handles small organic debris by curving around the
thin, contractile anterior portion (Fig. 90t, u).
Somatic cilia about 6 urn long. Ventral ciliary rows arranged in a left and right field leaving
blank broad, postoral stripe, posteriorly gradually shortened (right field) or staggering (left
field) and curved towards body midline; composed of monokinetids with circular outline in
protargol preparations, while elliptical in KLEIN-FOISSNER silver nitrate preparations,
probably due to an associated parasomal sac. Invariably five arched kineties in right field,
commence near left anterior body end above preoral kinety, except for the innermost row
which commences at level of oral basket opening; outermost kinety rather loosely ciliated,
especially in mid-region. Invariably five almost straight left field kineties, commence
underneath preoral kinety, except for the two innermost rows, which are highly variable in
length and commence near mid-body. Dorsal brush apical left of midline, in all populations
composed of only two 7 (am long and stiff cilia arising from a distinct pit (Fig. 90a-c, e, f, i, j;
341d-h; Table 73).
Oral ciliature Chilodonella-like, that is, comprises a preoral and two circumoral kineties, all
composed of closely spaced dikinetids having only the right (anterior) basal body ciliated,
according to the TEM observations of Chilodonella cyprini by HOFMANN (1987). Preoral
kinety slightly curved, commences underneath anterior end of middle kinety of right field and
extends obliquely to body midline above circumoral kinety. Circumoral kineties arched, form
Y-pattern, anterior row composed of about 15-18 dikinetids, posterior of circa 10-11. Oral
opening in body midline about 22% back from anterior end. Oral basket cornucopia-shaped,
extends obliquely to dorsal side and posteriad, composed of about eight rather thick, toothed
rods; distal end bulbous in protargol preparations (Fig. 90a, b, d, e, h, i; 341a, c).
Silverline pattern of Saudi Arabian specimens as in O. alpestris alpestris (FOISSNER 1981b),
that is, narrowly meshed with argyrophilic granules in some intersections (Fig. 90e, f; 34 ld-
0-
Encystment as in congeners (BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1992, FOISSNER 1981b, 1988b), that is,
conspicuously fast under slight cover glass pressure and when drop evaporates.
Occurrence and ecology: Odontochlamys alpestris biciliata was discovered in a soil
sample collected by Maria WALDHÖR on 28.02.1993 at the coast of Caracas Bay, Curacao
Island. The sample was an alkaline (pH 8.1), highly saline mixture of grass litter and humus.
Furthermore, we found the species in several other soils world-wide, e.g., in a slightly acidic
(pH 6.0), highly saline soil from the Al-Hassa Oasis in Saudi Arabia and in the circumneutral
(pH 6.7), mud and soil from Namibian site (49). Obviously, O. alpestris biciliata is a
euryhaline and cosmopolitan ciliate preferring terrestrial habitats.
The congeners also prefer edaphic habitats, although some populations of O. alpestris
alpestris and O. gouraudi have been recorded from freshwater (BLATTERER & FOISSNER
1992, BUITKAMP 1977a, CERTES 1891, FOISSNER 1981b, 1988b, WENZEL 1953).
Comparison with similar species: Our population is affiliated with Odonto-
chlamys, according to the improved genus diagnosis above. The structure of the dorsal brush
is an important species feature of chilodonellids (FOISSNER 1988b, KAHL 1931b). Thus, it
seems justified to establish a new subspecies for our populations, which differs from all
congeners and especially O. alpestris alpestris by the number of dorsal brush cilia: invariably
2 in all populations of O. alpestris biciliata; 3-6 ( x = 4) in soil and 6-9 (x = 7.4) in fresh-
393

water populations of O. alpestris alpestris (BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1992, FOISSNER 1981b);
4-5 in O. convexa (BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1992); 11-15 in O. gouraudi (FOISSNER 1988b);
and 3-5 (x = 4) in O. wisconsinensis (PETZ & FOISSNER 1997). The number of kineties in the
left ciliary field also distinguishes O. alpestris biciliata from the congeners (invariably 5 vs.
6-7; Table 73).
At first glance, Thigmogaster nanus SONG & WILBERT, 1989, T. oppositevacuolatus
AUGUSTIN & FOISSNER, 1989, and T potamophilus FOISSNER, 1988b resemble O. alpestris
biciliata because they have the same number of ventral ciliary rows and two distinct dorsal
brush cilia. However, the ventral kinety fields are much closer together in Thigmogaster than
in Odontochlamys, changing the overall ciliary pattern distinctly. Furthermore, Thigmogaster
species have a peculiar third dorsal brush cilium at level of oral entrance, a flat ventral side,
and live in freshwater (AUGUSTIN & FOISSNER 1989, FOISSNER 1988b, SONG & WILBERT
1989).

SUCTORIA
As sessile organisms, suctoria and peritrichs are rare in terrestrial habitats; still, the work by
PEN ARD (1914) is the most comprehensive study. This and our experience indicate that most
terricolous suctoria are likely still undescribed. Usually, they are too rare to be studied in
detail. Nevertheless, we can provide here good data from three species.
Podophrya tristriata nov. spec. (Fig. 91a-g; 342a—f, j—1; Table 74)
Diagnosis: Adults unstalked, globular, about 30 urn across in vivo, covered with thick,
very hyaline mucilaginous sheath. About 50 scattered tentacles up to 120 urn long. 2
contractile vacuoles. Swarmers about 35 x 18 urn in protargol preparations, reniform, usually
with 9 ciliary rows. Cysts stalked, about 30 urn across in vivo, invariably with 3 prominent
transverse ribs and many small, longitudinal crests.
Type location: Soil from forest near Tinaro Dam in the surroundings of Cairns,
Australia, 17°S 145°E.
Etymology: Composite of tri (Greek; three) and striatus (Latin; striated), referring to the
three transverse ribs of the resting cyst.
Description: Adults unstalked, 25-60 urn, usually 30 urn across in vivo, as calculated
from measurements of live specimens and values shown in table 74, assuming a shrinkage of
about 10% due to the preparation procedures. Mucilaginous sheath covers body proper;
although about 15-20 urn thick, inconspicuous because very hyaline and thus usually only
recognizable due to attached bacteria and debris (Fig. 91a-c; 342a-c). Tentacles scattered
over cell, penetrate mucilaginous sheath, numerous (about 50), all of same structure but
highly variable in length (up to four-times body diameter) and about 0.5 urn thick, conspicu-
ously zigzagging when contracting, proximal portion not conical; distal end distinctly capitate
because 1-2 urn wide and 3—4 urn long, contains minute, central vacuole (?). Macronucleus
in centre of cell, usually globular, packed with minute spheres in vivo, and with some nucleoli
in protargol preparations. Micronucleus globular, only occasionally recognizable due to
similarly sized cytoplasmic inclusions. Two opposed, peripheral contractile vacuoles
surrounded by contributory vesicles during diastole (Fig. 91a; 342a); excretory pores not
recognizable in protargol preparations of Australian type population, but several pores
observed in live specimens from a Japanese population. Cortex about 1 \im thick and smooth.
Cytoplasm colourless, packed with lipid droplets 1—4 urn across. Feeds on the heterotrophic
flagellate Polytomella and likely also on ciliates.
Budding external by "pseudo-scissipartie" (BATISSE 1975) and as described in P. fixa by
COLLIN (1912), that is, mother cell enlarges and forms a daughter cell bearing a ciliary stripe
with usually nine rows of closely spaced basal bodies; subsequently, the daughter transforms
into a motile swarmer. Aggregates of two to six cells each with a ciliary stripe, globular
macronucleus, slightly fusiform (dividing?) micronucleus, and tentacles are frequent in the
protargol slides (Fig. 9If); likely formed when next budding commences before previous
complete.

Swarmers found only in protargol preparations: 30-40 x 15-23 urn, reniform, one out of 28
specimens found had very short, capitate tentacles (Fig. 91g). Macronucleus in mid-body,
broadly ellipsoidal, with globular nucleoli. Micronucleus globular, often not recognizable due
to similarly sized cytoplasmic inclusions. Very likely two contractile vacuoles, one each in
anterior and posterior body end; excretory pores not recognizable. Ciliarure PodophryaAike,
that is, arranged in a stripe of about nine kineties along swarmer margin, more dense
anteriorly than posteriorly; detailed course of ciliary rows not recognizable.

Cysts 25-35 Jim across in vivo, of typical Podophrya structure, that is, globular, stalked, and
transversely ribbed (Fig. 9Id, e; 342J-1; Table 74). Cyst wall in live specimens of eleven
populations brownish and invariably with three prominent transverse ribs and many small,
longitudinal crests, while distinctly wrinkled and not impregnated in protargol preparations
from Australian type population; internal stalk anchoring cell to wall, as described in —> P.
halophila, not recognizable. Cyst opening (emergence pore) not recognizable either in vivo,
protargol preparations or a scanning electron micrograph of a Japanese specimen, also not
indicated by an apical plug as in -» P. halophila. Stalk up to 6 urn long, with narrowed mid-
portion and small, argyrophilic baseplate, frequently broken off. Macronucleus usually
fusiform to elongate ellipsoidal; occasionally heavily impregnated fibres (mitotic spindle?)
extend in main nucleus axis. Micronucleus adjacent to macronucleus, globular.
Occurrence and ecology: Podophrya tristriata was discovered in a sample from a
forest near the Tinaro Dam in the surroundings of Cairns, Australia. The sample was a
mixture of dry, yellow soil amended with roots and litter, pH 4.8. Adults with two contractile
vacuoles and a mucilaginous sheath as well as cysts with three prominent transverse ribs and
ordinary size also occurred in other terrestrial habitats of Australia: (i) slightly acidic (pH
5.2-5.7) soil samples from the Botanical Garden in Cairns; (ii) humus from decaying
epiphytes accumulated in ramifications of trees; and (iii) acidic (pH 5.7) soil with grass roots
taken from top of a hill near Alice Springs. In Japan, typical adults and/or cysts were found in
(i) tree and soil mosses collected around the "Spring of Wisdom" in Kyoto and (ii) in some
samples containing mosses, soil and bamboo litter collected in the surroundings of Tsukuba.
All Japanese samples were acidic with pH between 4.3 and 5.9. Likely, P. tristriata occurs in
edaphic habitats world-wide, preferring more or less acidic environments. Indeed, we recently
found it also in an acidic forest soil near Vienna, Austria (Fig. 342e, f).
At Namibian site (73), Podophrya cysts were found which match those off. tristriata in the
three prominent transverse ribs, but were 70 urn across (Fig. 342g-i); thus, they might belong
to another species. Further, a species exists that is highly similar to P. tristriata, but lacks the
mucilaginous sheath and has only five swarmer kineties; cysts were unfortunately not found.
Besides P. tristriata, only three podophryids have been recorded from soil (FOISSNER 1998a):
-> P. halophila KAHL, 1934; Sphaerophrya parva GREEFF, 1888; and S. terricola FOISSNER,
1986. Of these, however, only the latter are probably confined to terrestrial habitats.
Generic assignment and comparison with related species: KAHL (1934)
based the genera Podophrya EHRENBERG, 1834 and Sphaerophrya CLAPAREDE &
LACHMANN, 1859 on the presence vs. absence of a stalk in adults. However, CURDS (1986)
syhonyrriized them argümg that (i) the stalk is often lost in adults oVPödöphrya, while "some
adults of Sphaerophrya are apparently stalked; and (ii) the knowledge about these suctorians
is meagre and thus cysts may also be found in Sphaerophrya. Furthermore, he stated a high
similarity of Podophrya and —> Parapodophrya adults which, however, was not confirmed by
a reinvestigation of the type species, Parapodophrya soliformis (FOISSNER et al. 1995); the
swarmer is also highly different, while resting cysts are similar (cp. figures 342g and 343g
with figure 4 in FOISSNER et al. 1995). MATTHES (1988), not familiar with CURDS (1986),
continued to separate Podophrya and Sphaerophrya by the stalk of the adults, but weakened
the feature (usually present vs. lacking) and included another, namely the occurrence of cysts
(present and stalked vs. lacking). Basically, the argumentation by CURDS (1986) is correct;
however, as long as cysts are unknown in Sphaerophrya, synonymization is premature. Thus,
399

we follow MATTHES (1988) and affiliate our species with Podophrya, whose type species, P.
fixa (O. F. MÜLLER, 1786) EHRENBERG, 1834, forms a similar-shaped swarmer and cyst. This
discussion shows that affiliation of adults to Podophrya or Sphaerophrya and species
identification are extremely difficult or even impossible without detailed knowledge of the
life cycle.
According to CURDS (1986) and MATTHES (1988), there are only few free-living Podophrya
s.l. adults with two contractile vacuoles: Podophrya sandi COLLIN, 1911 (1-5 but usually 1;
cysts with five transverse ribs); P. gracilis CALKINS, 1902 (1-2, but cells only 8 urn across
and with very long stalk); Parapodophrya sparganium KAHL, 1931a (2-3, but tentacles with
conspicuous conical base); P. nigricans KAHL, 1931a (2-3, but with Parapodophrya
swarmer); Sphaerophrya magna MAUPAS, 1881 (1-2, but with eccentric macronucleus and
swarmers similar to those of -> Parapodophrya); S. natans PENARD, 1922 (only 5-6 very
long tentacles); Gajewskajophrya melosirae (GAJEWSKAJA, 1933) MATTHES, 1988 (about 90
jim across and with grouped tentacles). Podophrya maupasii BÜTSCHLI, 1889 has a
gelatinous, rather compact, thin layer (pellicle?) distinctly different from the fragile,
voluminous mucilaginous sheath of P. tristriata (only up to 9% of body diameter, as
estimated from figures 68a, b in COLLIN 1912 VS. about 50% of body diameter). Furthermore,
P. maupasii adults usually have only one contractile vacuole and the cysts lack transverse ribs
(COLLIN 1912). Adults of Mucophrya pelagica GAJEWSKAJA, 1933 are distinctly larger (65-
110 urn) than those of P. tristriata and have a thicker (40-70 urn) mucilaginous sheath and
only a single contractile vacuole.
Although Podophrya cysts usually show a high variability in the number of transverse ribs
(—» P. halophila), there are invariably three in the eleven populations of P. tristriata.
Podophrya fixa is the sole congener which forms, at least occasionally in pure line cultures,
cysts with only three ribs (REIBENBACH & REICH 1968). The adults, however, differ from P.
tristriata in having only a single contractile vacuole. Longitudinal cyst crests occur also in -»
P. halophila, P. grelli (as estimated from DIECKMANN 1985), and P. stylonychiae (as
estimated from FOISSNER 1980d), but they are much less distinct and more numerous than in
P. tristriata (Fig. 91e; 342f, g, 1). In -> P. halophila, the apical opening (emergence pore) of
the cyst is closed by a conspicuous plug, and the cell is anchored to the cyst wall by a short
stalk. Both structures are lacking in P. tristriata. Thus, they can possibly be used for a
meaningful splitting of the genus Podophrya. However, more and better data are required.
Podophrya halophila KAHL, 1934 (Fig. 92a-f; 343a-m; Table 75)
Description of Namibian site (48) population: Adults in vivo 15-35 urn,
usually 25 urn across. Globular, occasionally slightly flattened in stalk attachment area. Stalk,
although usually of body length, inconspicuous because only 1 urn thick and colourless,
proximal end cuff-like, distal adhering to soil particles with yellowish baseplate; without
transverse striation and apparently lacking in most specimens (Fig. 92a; 343a, b). Tentacles
scattered over cell, all of same structure, highly variable in number (15-48; Table 75) and
length (up to body diameter), 0.5-0.8 urn thick; distal end distinctly capitate because 1-2 urn
wide, proximal slightly conical and thus producing somewhat angular body outline. Macro-
nucleus usually globular, nucleolus reticular in vivo, while composed of one large (about 3
400

um across) and some small (about 1 urn across) globules in protargol preparations; occasion-
ally contains some heavily impregnated fibres (mitotic spindle?). Micronuclei not recogniz-
able due to many similarly sized cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole usually slightly
eccentric in posterior quarter of cell; two rather distant excretory pores near beginning of
ciliary ribbon in two well-impregnated specimens transforming into a swarmer, indicating
that two closely spaced vacuoles might be present. Cortex about 0.8 urn thick and smooth.
Cytoplasm packed with lipid droplets 1-4 urn across. Feeds mainly on Gonostomum spp.
Ciliary ribbon of specimens transforming into a total swarmer composed of four parallel rows
of closely spaced basal bodies.
Swarmers 30-45 x 15-25 urn in vivo. Shape rather variable, that is, broadly to elongate
ellipsoidal or slightly reniform, flattened up to 2:1, occasionally with truncate posterior end;
one broad side of cell with conspicuous furrow in midline (Fig. 92e, f; 343c, d). Tentacles
scattered over unciliated portion of broad cell sides, short (< 3 urn) and distinctly capitate.
Macronucleus usually in mid-body, shape highly variable, namely, globular to elongate
ellipsoidal; frequently, heavily impregnated fibres (mitotic spindle?) extend parallel to main
nucleus axis. Micronuclei usually not recognizable due to many similarly sized cytoplasmic
inclusions; however, in one specimen three micronuclei each about 3 urn across are recogniz-
able. Two contractile vacuoles mostly near anterior half of convex body margin, each with a
single excretory pore between second and third ciliary row (n = 5). Cilia form four circum-
ferential, posteriorly slightly opened rows on narrow sides of cell, distances between
individual cilia decrease towards both ends of kineties; kinetids connected by a thin, fibrillar
(?) structure. One distinctly shortened, C-shaped marginal kinety.
Cysts 20-35 x 20-40 urn in vivo; of typical Podophrya structure, that is, globular, stalked,
and transversely ribbed; cell attached to cyst wall by a minute internal stalk (Fig. 92c, d;
343e-m; Table 75). Cyst wall probably bilaminate, honey-yellow, with five to ten, usually six
conspicuous, in optical section triangular ribs very likely extending spirally from anterior to
posterior; surface finely striated longitudinally, except around apical collar, where a reticular
pattern is recognizable. Cyst opening (emergence pore) in anterior centre, surrounded by
distinct collar, closed by a compact, structureless, slightly argyrophilic, hemispherically
protruding plug intimately connected to cyst wall because it cannot be squashed off. Stalk
obconical, adheres cyst to soil particles, 6-20 urn long and usually 5 urn wide proximally.
Macronucleus globular to elongate ellipsoidal.
Occurrence and ecology: Podophrya halophila was found at Namibian site (48), that
is, in a circumneutral (pH 6.7), non-saline mixture of soil and litter from Combretum imberbe.
The other-records-listed in Table 4-are doubtful due to taxonomic problems (see below).
Comparison with previous descriptions and similar species: From
about 1000 moss and soil samples collected world-wide, FOISSNER (1998a) recorded only a
single Podophrya species, namely P. halophila KAHL, 1934, as redescribed by BLATTERER &
FOISSNER (1988), from a saline soil of Australia. The Namibian population matches the
Australian P. halophila in the edaphic habitat, the number of excretory pores in the adult and
swarmer as well as the longitudinal groove of the swarmer. Thus, we pragmatically identify
our population with this species, attributing the differences in size (adult: 15-35 urn vs. 25-
45 urn; swarmer: 30-45 urn vs. 45-70 urn; cyst: 20-40 urn vs. 30-45 urn) and numbers of
kineties (4 vs. usually 6), cyst ribs (usually 6, n = 51 vs. 12, n = 3) and contractile vacuoles (1
vs. 2 in the adult) to the ordinary intraspecific variability.

congeners, e, f: Ciliary pattern of narrow and broad side of swarmers. The excretory pores of the two contractile vacuoles are

Basically, however, Podophrya species identification is extremely difficult; actually, the
Australian, Namibian, and German populations of P. halophila are hardly distinguishable
from, e.g., Sphaerophrya terricola FOISSNER, 1986 and the common P.fixa, as reviewed by
FOISSNER et al. (1995). On the other hand, they are rather different in details, for instance,
adult size: 50-90 um (KAHL 1934), about 35 um (BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1988), and only
15-35 um in the Namibian population. This frustrating situation is, at least partially, caused
by many poor descriptions and redescriptions. At the present state of knowledge, it is crucial

halophila from Namibian site (48).

to show the features not only by line drawings but also by micrographs and morphometry,
giving later investigators a chance to re-evaluate the data. For instance, the small stalk
anchoring the cyst to the wall has not been described in any other Podophrya species, but it is
impossible to know whether this is due to superficial observation or because our organism is a
distinct species or even genus. Likewise, the conspicuous plug closing the cyst opening has
rarely been mentioned (CANTER et al. 1990, DINGFELDER 1962, FAURE-FREMIET 1945,
REIBENBACH & REICH 1968).
Metacineta namibiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 93a-o; 344a-k; Table 76)
Diagnosis: Globular, about 20 urn across in vivo, lorica abruptly merging into minute
stalk. Tentacles distinctly capitate, emerge through 6 lorica clefts. 2 contractile vacuoles.
Swarmers about 45 x 20 urn in vivo, reniform, with 5 obliquely C-shaped ciliary rows and 1
very short kinety on scopuloid bearing side.
Type location: Slightly saline sand dune from Namib Escarpment, Namibia, 23°50'S
16°E (site 33 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the region (Namib Desert) discovered.
Description: We use anterior and posterior as well as ventral and dorsal according to
GUILCHER(1951).
Adult cells 15-25 jam across in vivo; globular in lateral view, indistinctly hexagonal in top
view due to six bundles of about seven tentacles each (Fig. 93a-d; 344a-c, f-h, k; Table 16).
Tentacles emerge from lorica clefts only, up to 70 urn long and about 0.6-1 urn thick,
distinctly capitate because of about 2 urn wide distal end containing haptocysts, conspicu-
ously zigzagging when contracting; highly variable in number, namely, 28-51, usually 38.
Occasionally, fibres (?) that impregnate with protargol spread radially into cell from tentacle
bases. Macronucleus in centre of cell, globular, pyriform.or fusiform, about 9 urn across in
vivo and containing numerous globules up to 1.2 um across. Probably one or two globular
micronuclei difficult to distinguish from similarly sized cytoplasmic inclusions. Two
contractile vacuoles opposed or slightly obliquely opposed in or above mid-body, surrounded
by contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pores not recognizable. Cytoplasm
colourless. Feeds on various ciliates (Pseudochilodonopsis mutabilis, Colpoda maupasi,
Gonostomum spp.) and the heterotrophic flagellate Polytomella sp. (Fig. 344d, e). Resting
cysts not found.
Lorica 18-25 urn across, thin and brownish in vivo, usually does not impregnate with
protargol; cup-shaped in lateral view, with hemispherical posterior portion merging abruptly
into a minute and thus inconspicuous stalk; more or less distinctly hexagonal in top view
because anterior half contains six almost equidistant, radial, slightly protruding and inclined
clefts through which the tentacles emerge (Fig. 93a-c; 344a, c, f-h; Table 76).
Budding commences with the subapical production of six parallel ciliary rows; subsequently,
the ciliated cell portion protrudes and performs a turn about main body axis causing an
oblique course of the kineties (Fig. 93i, j). Swarmers 35-50 x 15-20 (am in vivo, while
distinctly shrunken and thus only 28-35 x 10-14 urn in protargol preparations. Overall shape

reniform to elongate reniform, frequently with small bulge in or near mid-body on concave
side, inconspicuously flattened; length:width ratio about 2-3:1 in vivo and protargol
preparations (Table 76). About 1 urn long, finger-like tentacles were observed in one living
specimen. Macronucleus highly variable in shape, namely, pyriform, elongate ellipsoidal or
globular, contains numerous globules and nucleoli 1-2 urn across. Probably one or two
micronuclei about 3 urn across, difficult to recognize due to numerous similarly sized
cytoplasmic inclusions. Two or three contractile vacuoles in variable positions, however,
usually near body ends; excretory pores not recognizable. Cytoplasm packed with fat globules
1-4 urn across. Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, closely spaced at anterior body end, while
loosely so at posterior and convex side leaving blank mid-portion of concave side and
adjacent ventral and dorsal region; arranged in six obliquely C-shaped, equidistant rows (Fig.
93k-o; 344i, j): kinety 1 commences dorsally near anterior end of midline and curves slightly
obliquely to dorsal posterior pole area; C-shaped kineties 2-5 form slightly oblique ribbon on
convex swarmer side with anterior end curved ventrolaterally and posterior dorsolaterally;
kinety 5 interrupted mid-ventrally; kinety 6 within anterior curve of C-shaped ciliary ribbon,
comprises only three to five basal bodies. A small pit or wrinkled structure (scopuloid?), 1-2
urn across, near centre of ventral side where kinety 5 is interrupted; surrounded by many
minute granules in vivo, impregnates heavily with protargol.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location.
Comparison with related species: Taxonomy of Metacineta is bewildering, likely
because based only on (often poor) live observations (RiEDER 1985, MATTHES 1988). One of
the most striking features of the Namibian species is its small size, possibly related to the soil
habitat. Metacineta namibiensis is similar to M. mystacea var. brevipes SAND, 190013, as
described by RIEDER (1985), in the number of lorica clefts and the small stalk. Both differ
distinctly in lorica shape (globular vs. conical), lorica size (15-25 urn vs. 50-60 x 36-49 urn),
and number of contractile vacuoles in the adult (1 vs. 2). Furthermore, the stalk is even much
smaller in M. namibiensis (1/10 of lorica length) than in M. mystacea var. brevipes (1/6-1/5
of lorica length; Fig. 93e, f).
Metacineta namibiensis is rather similar to M. micraster (PENARD, 1914) BATISSE, 1967 in
lorica shape and colour. However, both are distinguished by lorica size (15-25 urn vs. 30-56
urn) and number of lorica clefts (6 vs. 5) and contractile vacuoles in the adult (2 vs. 1).
Furthermore, M. micraster lacks a stalk (Fig. 93g, h).
As concerns the swarmer, data are available only from M. mystacea and its many varieties
and forms (COLLIN 1912, FOISSNER et al. 1995, GUILCHER 1951, PENARD 1920, SCHMITZ
1986); however, they are sparse and so contradictory that they are likely based on different
species. Thus, this feature can hardly be used to differentiate species at the present state of
knowledge. However, the observations of PENARD (1920) and GUILCHER (1951) match our
data rather well and suggest that the Namibian species differs from M. mystacea varieties by
the large barren area on the concave (left) side and the number of ciliary rows (6 vs. about
10). -» Podophrya swarmers are distinguished from M. namibiensis swarmers by the fully
ciliated concave side.
13 SAND (1900) did not provide a figure of his variety "brevipes", but designated specimens in which the stalk
occupies only 1/7 of lorica length as "brevipes". A nomenclatural discussion of this "variety" is beyond the
scope of this monograph.

Parapodophrya sp. (Fig. 344 1-n)
At Namibian site (4) a few swarmers occurred which, according to the characteristic shape
and structure, belong to the suctorian genus Parapodophrya. Unfortunately, no adults were
found; thus, a reliable identification was impossible. Several Parapodophrya species have
been described (MATTHES 1988). However, only the type of the genus, P. soliformis, has been
reliably documented (FOISSNER et al. 1995).

NASSULIA
The nassulids, as classified by DEROUX (1994), are a rather homogenous group united by two
strong apomorphies, viz., the cortical alveolocysts and the mixokinetal stomatogenesis
(EISLER & BARDELE 1983, 1986, FOISSNER 1996C). Although nassulids are rare in terrestrial
habitats (FOISSNER 1998a), several new species were described over the years: Colpodidium
caudatum WlLBERT, 1982; Nassula terricola FOISSNER, 1989; Obertrumia kahli FOISSNER,
1989; Urliella terricola FOISSNER, 1989; Parafurgasonia terricola FOISSNER, 1999b;
Pedohymena australiensis FOISSNER, 1995; Drepanomonas pauciciliata FOISSNER, 1989; and
D. exigua bidentata FOISSNER, 1999b. Several other species were redescribed in the studies
cited above and in FOISSNER (1998a, 1999b): Nassula citrea KAHL; N. picta GREEFF;
Parafurgasonia sorex (PENARD); P. protectissima (PENARD); Drepanomonas sphagni KAHL;
D. exigua exigua PENARD; Microthorax simulans (KAHL); and Stammeridium kahli
(WENZEL).
In the present monograph, which contains all other not yet published nassulids (except for
four new microthoracids) found in soils world-wide, the 16 species listed above are increased
by 11 new species and the redescription of 7 poorly known species. The data obtained from
these investigations cause important changes in the familial and suprafamilial classification of
the group, including the new order Colpodidiida, whose members obviously prefer soil and
semiterrestrial (e.g., mud from ephemeral waters) habitats.
Taken together, 24 new nassulids were described from terrestrial habitats world-wide during
the past 20 years, increasing the 62 species listed in KAHL (1931b) by more than one third.
This is a considerable gain, especially in a group which obviously does not prefer terrestrial
habitats, indicating that there must be many more free-living ciliate species than the 3000
estimated by FINLAY (2001). See chapter 3.1.7 for a more detailed discussion of this matter.
Family Nassulidae FROMENTEL, 1874
Improved diagnosis (Fig. 94a-g): Small to very large Nassulida JANKOWSKI, 1967a
with conspicuous pharyngeal basket extending posteriorly. Nassulid organelles composed of
three ciliary rows and usually numerous, forming distinct frange extending leftwards and
splitting" somatic ciliary rows. Paroral membrane often inconspicuous, in Rhinakis possibly
even lacking.
Type genus: Nassula EHRENBERG, 1834.
Remarks: To our knowledge, nobody ever fixed a type genus for the Nassulidae; however,
FROMENTEL (1874) used the stem "Nassul-" for the family group name, indicating that he
based it on the genus Nassula. For the sake of stability and in accordance with article 64 of
the ICZN (1999), we agree with CORLISS (1961) in suppressing the older name Liosiphonidae
DIESING and crediting the family not to BÜTSCHLI (1889) but to FROMENTEL, who first
proposed a family "Nassuliens (Nassulina)".

Silver impregnation showed a conspicuous diversity within the genus Nassula EHRENBERG,
1834. Thus, FRYD-VERSAVEL et al. (1980) split it into -• Nassula, Zosterograptus, -»
Naxella, and -» Rhinakis. Unfortunately, they did not designate a type species for Zostero-
graptus and founded -> Rhinakis on a nomen nudum species. Therefore, these genera are
invalid (FOISSNER 1987a). Nevertheless, both survived in the literature (DEROUX 1994,
PATTERSON et al. 1989). Further nomenclatural ambiguities were introduced by DEROUX
(1994). Although regarding —»• Rhinakis as valid (citing, however, the authors of the genus
incorrectly), he reinstalled it with the combined description of "Rhinakis faurei n. g., n. sp.".
Our detailed investigations on 18 nassulids showed that the structure of the nassulid frange is
the best feature, at least at light microscopic level, to distinguish genera within the family.
The paroral membrane is composed of dikinetids, which are sometimes rather loosely
arranged (EISLER 1986, PUYTORAC & NJINE 1980). In the light microscope, it is often difficult
to recognize, and thus should not be used to differentiate genera (see —> Rhinakis). Further-
more, paroral dikinetids generated in the opisthe during ontogenesis are apparently reduced to
monokinetids in late dividers of some species (EISLER & BARDELE 1986). These mono-
kinetids are often more closely spaced than those in the anterior portion of kinety 2. As
concerns the structure of the nassulid organelles, see GRAIN et al. (1978), EisLER (1986, 1988,
1989), and figures 94a-g.
Species identification and description: As concerns species identification,
combined data from live observation (especially extrusomes and pharyngeal basket) and
silver-impregnated specimens (especially shape of nassulid frange and number of nassulid
organelles and ciliary rows) are indispensable because many nassulids look alike, that is, have
a similar size and shape.
Of outstanding importance are the shape, structure, and presence/absence of extrusomes.
Except for the microthoracids (HAUSMANN 1978), the fine structure of the nassulid extru-
somes is poorly known, and they are considered either as mucocysts (GRAIN et al. 1978) or
trichocysts (EISLER 1986). We designate them pragmatically as "trichocysts" because they
usually look very similar to hymenostome spindle trichocysts. Furthermore, in several
groups/species not only highly refractive, fusiform trichocysts occur, but also inconspicuous,
platelet-like mucocysts, which can form a voluminous coat, similar as, e.g., in Tetrahymena.
Nassula EHRENBERG, 1834
Improved diagnosis (Fig. 94d): Nassulidae with nassulid frange extending sigmoidally
to main body axis. Nassulid organelles numerous and orientated parallel to frange axis.
Type species: Nassula flava CLAPAREDE & LACHMANN, 1859 [subsequent designation
by FROMENTEL (1874), see FOISSNER (1987a)].
411

Obertrumia Foissner & Adam, 1981
Improved diagnosis (Fig. 94e): Nassulidae with bipartite nassulid frange: ventrolateral
portion curved, dorsal portion straight. Nassulid organelles numerous and orientated parallel
to frange axis.
Type species: Nassulageorgiana DRAGESCO, 1972 (original designation).
Remarks: Contrary to DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) and DEROUX (1994), we
maintain Obertrumia with the arguments given by FOISSNER (1987a).
Naxella FRYD-VERSAVEL, IFTODE & DEROUX, 1980
Diagnosis (according to FRYD-VERSAVEL et al. 1980; Fig. 94f): Nassulidae with
stomatogenic kineties reduced to the paroral segment.
Type species: Nassula lateritia CLAPAREDE& LACHMANN, 1859 (original designation).
Remarks: FRYD-VERSAVEL et al. (1980) never substantiated this ontogenetic genus
definition with detailed data. Thus, the status of the genus is doubtful. The species assigned to
Naxella by FRYD-VERSAVEL et al. (1980) and FOISSNER & O'DONOGHUE (1990) look rather
dissimilar to Nassula because they have few (3-4; many in Nassula) nassulid organelles,
which form a slightly posteriorly extending (anteriorly or perpendicularly in Nassula) frange.
Furthermore, and possibly of greater importance than the other features mentioned, the distal
portion of the pharyngeal basket must be different in Naxella and Nassula because it looks
quite different in silver carbonate impregnations. In Nassula, the distal basket end is dome-
shaped. In Naxella, the basket end is more or less distinctly cone-shaped and composed of
heavily impregnated, ellipsoidal structures (seemingly?) connected by a ring-shaped,
membranous structure. Clearly, detailed ontogenetic and electron microscopic investigations
are needed to establish whether or not Naxella is a bona fide genus. For the present, we
pragmatically assign those species which have the features discussed above to this genus, that
is, few nassulid organelles forming a slightly posteriorly directed frange and a cone-shaped
basket end composed of ellipsoidal structures.

Diagnosis (Fig. 94f): Nassulidae with short nassulid frange (3-5 organelles) and without
paroral membrane.
Type species: RhinakisfaureiDEROUX, 1994 (typeby monotypy).
Remarks: The lack of a paroral membrane in Rhinakis, as stated by FRYD- VERSA VEL et al.
(1980) and DEROUX (1994), is not unlikely because we also found two species, -» N. granata
and —• N. tuberculata, where no paroral formation is recognizable, not even in excellently
prepared specimens (Fig. 348g, i). Furthermore, a reinvestigation of the type material of N.
terricola FOISSNER, 1989 showed that FOISSNER (1989) over-interpreted his slides, viz.,
considered the slightly narrowed spacing of the kinetids in the anterior portion of kinety 1 as
indication of paroral dikinetids, which are recognizable neither in silver nitrate stains nor in a
silver carbonate preparation (Fig. 350b). However, the paroral is inconspicuous in many
nassulids, and thus the supposed lack must be proven by electron microscopy before the
genus can be recognized. Furthermore, the paroral is partially reduced during late ontogenesis
(EISLER & BARDELE 1986).
Nassulides nov. gen.
Diagnosis (Fig. 94g): Nassulid organelles numerous, rightmost ones orientated obliquely
to frange axis and overlapping proximally, others arranged parallel to frange axis.
Type species: Nassulapicta GREEFF, 1888.
Etymology: Composite of Nassula (nassa; lat., basket) and ides (gr., similar to genus
Nassula). Masculine gender.
Systematic position and comparison with related genera: Nassulides
has a nassulid frange which commences underneath the oral opening, extends across the left
ventral side, and terminates dorsally. Accordingly, it belongs to the family Nassulidae, as
defined above. Nassulides is rather similar to Nassula, differing solely by the oblique
arrangement of the right nassulid organelles. Thus, its generic status might be questioned. On
the other hand, nassulids are a species-rich group requiring some organization for practical
purposes. The following species have to be combined with Nassulides: N. pictus (GREEFF,
1888) nov. comb, (basinoym: Nassula picta), as redescribed by FOISSNER (1980e, 1989) and
FOISSNER et al. (1994); -+ N. labiatus (KAHL, 1933) nov. comb, (basionym: Nassula labiata),
as redescribed in the present "paper and by BORROR (1972b), DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-
KERNEIS (1986) and SONG & WEI (1998); N. pratensis (CZAPIK & JORDAN, 1976b) nov. comb,
(basionym: Nassula pratensis), as originally described and confirmed by DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986); TV. vernalis (GELEI & SZABADOS, 1950) nov. comb, (basionym:
Nassula vernalis), as redescribed and neotypified by FOISSNER (1989). Two of these species
(-> N labiatus, N pratensis) were assigned by FRYD-VERSAVEL et al. (1980) to Zostero-
graptus, which is, however, invalid because of the lack of a type species (FOISSNER 1987a).
Furthermore, FRYD-VERSAVEL et al. (1980) have a different genus concept, with which we do
not agree. For instance, they assign Nassula aurea and N. ornata to the same genus {Nassula),
although the nassulid frange is quite different.
413

Nassula longinassa FOISSNER, 1980e (Fig. 95a-f; 263-266, 345a-p; Table 77)
Neotype material: Neotypified from Namibian site (57) population, according to
reasons 1, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 30-50 x 20-30 urn in vivo; broadly ellipsoidal. Two
types of extrusomes: fusiform, about 7 urn long trichocysts and platelet-like, minute
mucocysts. On average 28 ciliary rows and 6 nassulid organelles extending onto dorsal side
of cell terminating distinctly underneath level of oral opening. Pharyngeal basket composed
of about 13 slightly twisted rods extending to posterior body end. Paroral membrane distinct,
composed of about 11 dikinetids.
Description of Namibian population: Size 28-50 x 20-30 urn, usually about 35
x 25 urn in vivo, length:width ratio approximately 1.6:1 in vivo, about 1.4:1 in preparations,
and approximately 1.2:1 in precystic cells; specimens from Austrian type population 45-55
urn long. Overall shape broadly ellipsoidal to cylindroidal, with widely rounded ends and
shallow postorganellar furrow (Fig. 95a, e; 345 1; Table 77). Macronucleus usually in middle
third of cell, about 8 urn across in vivo, with reticular nucleolus. Usually two globular
micronuclei adjacent to macronucleus. Contractile vacuole in mid-body, surrounded by small
contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pore in line with paroral membrane. Cytopyge
slit underneath excretory pore, extends to near posterior body end, about 6-8 urn long.
Resting trichocysts attached almost perpendicularly to cortex, fusiform, about 7 x 0.7-0.8
urn, not very numerous (do not form distinct fringe), but highly conspicuous because large
compared to size of cell; extruded trichocysts also fusiform, up to 50 urn long and 1.5 urn
wide (Fig. 95a, c, d; 345f, o). Trichocysts more numerous and only 5 urn long in alpine type
population. Resting mucocysts hardly recognizable, produce bright, about 1 \im thick cortical
layer, released as 1-2 um-sized, polygonal platelets when methyl green-pyronin is added,
soon swelling to a fluffy coat (Fig. 345i, p); become bright, distinct globules about 1-2 urn
across in precystic cells (Fig. 345g, h). Cortex slightly punctated by ciliary pits. Cells
greenish and/or yellow-brown, as in type population, due to ingested cyanobacteria and
citrine to golden patch of granules in left anterior body portion; granules 0.2-1 urn across and
also scattered in cytoplasm but sparse and thus not colouring cell. Feeds mainly on coccal
cyanobacteria digested in vacuoles 2-5 urn across. Swims rapidly and irregularly.
Somatic cilia about 8 jam long in vivo, arise from shallow cortical pits, loosened in posterior
pole area; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in
second kinety and ciliary rows underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary rows longitudinally
and equidistantly arranged, except for more closely spaced first (paroral) and second kinety,
which end in mid-body; form distinct preoral suture and postorganellar stripe both about 3
urn wide (Fig. 95a, e, f; 263-266, 345a-e, i-1).
Oral opening subapical, elliptical. Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to dorsal side and
posterior end of cell, funnel-shaped, about 4 jam wide and slightly bulbous distally, composed
of 10-14 thick, indistinctly twisted rods; annulus and distal microtubular sheath recognizable
neither in vivo nor protargol preparations. Nassulid frange slightly sigmoidal, terminates near
dorsal margin more or less distinctly above mid-body (Fig. 95e, f; 263-266, 345c, d, k; Table
77). Nassulid organelles composed of three kineties each, decrease in size from right to left, that

is, first organeile with about eight cilia per kinety, last with only two to three; upper rightmost
basal bodies of first organelle frequently lacking (Fig. 95e; 345a, d, j, n), other organelles
occasionally also incomplete (Fig. 345d). Length of cilia decreases within each organelle
from about 10 urn at right to about 7 urn at left end. Paroral membrane rather conspicuous,
continuous with first somatic ciliary row, commences at level of oral opening and extends in a
flat bow to near excretory pore of contractile vacuole, composed of 8-15 closely spaced,
counter-clockwise inclined dikinetids in anterior portion and parallel dikinetids in posterior
(Fig. 95e; 263-266, 345a, j).
Occurrence and ecology: FOISSNER (1980e) discovered Nassula longinassa in a
meltwater pond in the Austrian Central Alps. We found it in highly saline soils of the Etosha
Pan (sites 53, 57). Thus, N. longinassa seems to be a euryhaline, cosmopolitan species.

Comparison with original description and related species: The original
description of N. longinassa is entirely based on live observations and thus fairly incomplete.
However, the main features mentioned (small size, long pharyngeal basket, conspicuous
trichocysts) are also found in the Namibian specimens. Thus, neotypification seems justified.
The few differences found, such as the number and length of the trichocysts (see above) and
416

the diameter of the pharyngeal basket (4-5 vs. 7 urn), are inconspicuous and insufficient to
separate the populations. There are several other small nassulids resembling N. longinassa: —»
Nassula parva; Nassula argentula BIERNACKA, 1963; -» Nassula exigua; and Naxella minuta
DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS, 1986. However, these species lack trichocysts (at least,
none are mentioned in the descriptions) and should thus not be identified (synonymized) with
N. longinassa.
Nassula parva KAHL, 1928 (Fig. 96a-i; 346c-f; Table 78)
Neotype material: Neotypified from Kenyan population, according to reasons 1, 2, 4, 6
given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 50 x 30 urn in vivo; broadly ellipsoidal. Mucocysts
minute, platelet-like. On average 22 ciliary rows and 5 nassulid organelles terminating
dorsolaterally at level of oral opening. Pharyngeal basket composed of about 16 distinctly
twisted rods extending to posterior third of cell. Paroral membrane conspicuous, composed of
about 7 dikinetids.
Redescription: Size 40-70 x 25-40 urn in vivo, as calculated from measurements of live
specimens and values shown in table 78, assuming a shrinkage of about 10% due to prepara-
tion procedures. Overall shape broadly ellipsoidal with shallow furrow underneath nassulid
frange; length:width ratio about 1.6:1 both in vivo and after protargol impregnation, 2:1 in
specimens without food vacuoles; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 96a, d, f). Macro-
nucleus usually in posterior half of cell, globular to broadly ellipsoidal, with reticular
nucleolus. Micronucleus in indentation of macronucleus, lenticular. Contractile vacuole
slightly below mid-body, surrounded by small contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory
pore between last and penultimate kinety. Cytopyge slit underneath excretory pore, about 10
urn long. Resting mucocysts hardly recognizable, produce bright, about 1 urn thick cortical
layer, occasionally released as 1-2 um-sized, polygonal platelets swelling to a fibrous coat
when methyl green-pyronin is added (Fig. 346f). No trichocysts. Cortex punctated by ciliary
pits. Cells blue-green or yellow due to cyanobacteria in various stages of digestion and 1-1.5
um-sized, yellow, bright globules forming distinct patch in left anterior body portion and
persisting in specimens with few or no food vacuoles. Feeds mainly on cyanobacteria
digested in 3-10 um-sized food vacuoles becoming yellow during late digestion stages.
Moves slowly.
Somatic cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, slightly loosened but not elongated in posterior pole
area; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in
ciliary rows right of oral opening and underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary rows
meridionally and equidistantly arranged, except for a few closely spaced postoral kineties,
form distinct preoral suture and an about 3 urn wide postorganellar stripe (Fig. 96a, b, h, i;
346d; Table 78).
Oral opening subapical. Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to dorsal side and posterior third
of cell, funnel-shaped, in vivo slightly bulbous and about 6 urn wide distally, composed of
12-18 rather thin, strongly twisted rods; distal microtubular sheath distinct in protargol
preparations; annulus recognizable neither in vivo nor after protargol impregnation. Nassulid

frange commences mid-ventrally and extends slightly sigmoidally to left side, terminating at
level of oral opening (Fig. 96b, h, i; 346c-e). Nassulid organelles composed of three kineties
each, decrease in size from right to left, that is, first organelle with about 6-8 cilia per kinety,
last with 2-3; upper rightmost basal body of first organelle frequently lacking. Paroral
membrane conspicuous, continuous with first somatic kinety, extends in a flat bow at right
side of oral opening, composed of about 7 clockwise inclined dikinetids recognizable both in
protargol and silver carbonate-impregnated specimens (Fig. 96b, h; 346c-e; Table 78).
Silverline system as in Parafurgasonia, that is, tightly and irregularly meshed producing
about five polygons between each two ciliary rows (Fig. 96g).
Occurrence and ecology: KAHL (1928) discovered Nassula parva in a possibly
slightly saline pond of northern Germany. We found it in slightly to strongly saline materials
from Kenya and Namibia (sites 62, 70). The neotype is from the margin of a geyser in the
littoral of Lake Baringo in Kenya (01°N 36°E). The grass around the geyser is densely
colonized by brownish algae, and the soil is highly saline. The sample consisted mainly of
such grass and some adhering soil particles. The ciliate community developed comprised
about 17, mainly edaphic species. In Namibia, N. parva occurred in slightly to highly saline
soils, suggesting that it is a halophile cosmopolitan.

b Of 15 Nassula exigua specimens investigated, one has 3 micronuclei.
Comparison with original description and related species: Our
population matches the rather incomplete original description (Fig. 96c) in body shape, body
size (60 x 40 um), lack of trichocysts (at least none are mentioned), and habitat (saline pond).
There are, however, several other small, trichocyst-less nassulids: —> Nassula exigua KAHL,
1931 (only 35 urn long and only 10 pharyngeal rods, as redescribed below), N. argentula
BiERNACKA, 1963 (a junior synonym of//, exigua, see below), and N. pusilla KAHL, 1931
(about 40 pharyngeal rods). Our specimens also resemble Nassula sp. found by VUXANOVICI
(1962a) in a Romanian lake. Unfortunately, neither KAHL (1928, 1931) nor VUXANOVICI
(1962) give any information about the frange and number of pharyngeal rods and ciliary
rows; thus, any identification is more or less arbitrarily and neotypification is required.
Nassula tumida MASKELL, 1887, as redescribed by PUYTORAC & NJINE (1980), differs from
N. parva greatly in body size (90-100 x 55-60 urn vs. 35-65 x 25-40 urn) and number of
nassulid organelles (12-13 vs. 4-5) and ciliary rows (55-60 vs. 21-23); thus, they are not
synonymous, as supposed by KAHL (1931) and DINGFELDER (1962).
The general appearance of N. parva highly resembles a miniaturized Nassulides pictus. In
silver preparations, both are easily distinguished by the genus diagnostics, that is, the
arrangement of the nassulid organelles; in vivo, they can be distinguished by body size (< 70
urn vs. > 70 urn) and the number of ciliary rows (< 25 vs. > 35), pharyngeal rods (< 18 vs.
about 24), and nassulid organelles (4-5 vs. 7-8). The same features basically separate N.
parva from species of the N. terricola-complex (-> N. tuberculata, N. terricola, -» N.
granata).
420

Nassula exigua KAHL, 1931 (Fig. 97a-g; 346a, b; Table 78)
1963 Nassula argentula BlERNACKA, Polskie Archwm Hydrobiol., 11: 38 (new synonym).
Neotype material: Neotypified from Venezuelan population, according to reasons 1—4,
6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Synonymy: Nassula argentula was superficially described and discussed by BlERNACKA
(1963; Fig. 97f). The characteristics given, especially the minute size (less than 35 urn) match
those of N. exigua, except for the habitat (brackish coastal water vs. terrestrial mosses). We
suggest synonymy at the present state of knowledge and because we found a Nassula which
highly resembles KAHL'S N. exigua in an inland salt pan.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 35 x 20 urn in vivo; broadly ellipsoidal. Mucocysts
minute, platelet-like. On average 22 ciliary rows and 4 nassulid organelles extending slightly
sigmoidally to left body margin terminating near level of oral opening. Pharyngeal basket
composed of about 10 straight rods extending to posterior third of cell. Paroral membrane
conspicuous, composed of about 8 dikinetids.
Redescription: Size 27-45 x 15-30 urn in vivo, as calculated from measurements of
live specimens and values shown in table 78, assuming a shrinkage of about 5% due to the
preparation procedures. Overall shape ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal, with shallow furrow
underneath nassulid frange; length: width ratio about 1.8:1 in vivo and 1.5:1 in silver nitrate
preparations, slightly flattened dorsoventrally (Fig. 97a; 346a). Macronucleus frequently in
posterior half of cell, globular. Usually two globular micronuclei attached to macronucleus.
Contractile vacuole slightly above mid-body, surrounded by small contributory vesicles
during diastole; excretory pore distinct in vivo but not recognizable in silver nitrate prepara-
tions. Cytopyge slit in line with paroral membrane, about 8 urn long, rarely recognizable in
silver nitrate impregnations. Resting mucocysts hardly recognizable, produce bright, about 1
urn thick cortical layer, released as 2-3 urn-sized, polygonal platelets swelling to a thin coat
when methyl green-pyronin is added (Fig. 346b). No trichocysts. Cortex punctated by ciliary
pits. Cells greenish or yellowish due to cyanobacteria in various stages of digestion and
yellow, bright, minute globules forming patch in left anterior body portion (Fig. 346a). Feeds
on cyanobacteria digested in vacuoles becoming yellow during late digestion stages. Swims
and glides rather rapidly.
Somatic cilia about 7 urn long in vivo, except for 10 urn long and loosened cilia in posterior
pole area; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in
ciliary rows right of oral opening and underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary rows
meridionally and equidistantly arranged, except for a few closely spaced postoral kineties,
form distinct preoral suture and a 2-3 urn wide postorganellar stripe. Second kinety fre-
quently with some clockwise inclined dikinetids at level of paroral membrane (Fig. 97a, c, g).
Oral opening subapical. Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to dorsal side and posterior third
of cell, funnel-shaped, composed of about 10 rather thick, straight rods; basket annulus and
microtubular sheath recognizable neither in vivo nor silver nitrate preparations. Nassulid
frange extends slightly sigmoidally to left body margin terminating near level of oral opening

422

(Fig. 97c, g). Nassulid organelles conspicuous even in vivo, composed of three kineties each,
decrease in size from right to left, that is, first organelle with about 6 cilia per kinety, last with
2-3; upper rightmost basal bodies occasionally lacking. Paroral membrane recognizable even
in vivo because large compared to body size, continuous with first kinety, extends in flat bow
at right side of oral opening, composed of about eight clockwise inclined, ciliated dikinetids
(Fig. 97c and in vivo observ.).
Silverline system as in Parafurgasonia, that is, tightly and irregularly meshed producing
about two to three polygons between each two ciliary rows (Fig. 97e).
Occurrence and ecology: KAHL (1931b) discovered N. exigua in mosses from two
sites of Germany and a site in Wisconsin, USA. Later, the proposed synonym N. argentula
was recorded from coastal waters of the Gulf of Gdansk at salinities of 6.5-7.5%o
(BiERNACKA 1963). We found N. exigua in the Morrocoy National Park, that is, in a soil
sample from a small salt pan about 500 m inshore near the town of Morrocoy, Venezuela
(10°N 68°W). The sample contained brownish, circumneutral (pH 7.3), highly saline soil,
litter and roots from halophytes, and some greenish salt crusts from the pan surface. Accord-
ingly, N. exigua is a eurytopic and euryhaline cosmopolitan.
Comparison with original description and related species: The original
description of N. exigua is entirely based on live observations. Thus, it is fairly incomplete
and lacks, for instance, information about the nassulid frange. However, other main diagnos-
tics, such as the small size (30—40 urn), body shape, number of pharyngeal rods (8), and lack
of trichocysts match the Venezuelan specimens. Only the colour (colourless vs. green-yellow)
and habitat (mosses vs. highly saline soil) are different. Colour is a weak feature depending
on food organisms (bacilli according to KAHL 1931b vs. cyanobacteria) and the life cycle.
The habitat salinity is a more serious difference. However, some (many?) nassulids are
euryhaline, for instance -> Nassulides labiatus. Further, the proposed junior synonym,
Nassula argentula BIERNACKA, 1963 was discovered in brackish coastal water. Thus and
because of the meagre original description, it seems justified to consider the Venezuelan
population as a neotype.
There are several small nassulids, which resemble N. exigua: Nassula minima MINKEWITSCH,
1899 (two contractile vacuoles), N. pusilla KAHL, 1931b (about 40 pharyngeal rods), —» N.
longinassa FoiSSNER, 1980e (trichocysts and 6-8 nassulid organelles, as redescribed above),
-> Nassula lucida REUTER, 1961 (trichocysts and 2 nassulid organelles, as redescribed
below), and Naxella minuta DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS, 1986 (40 ciliary rows and 5-8
nassulid organelles). Furthermore, J/. exigua is rather difficult to distinguish from -> Nassula
parva, as redescribed above: body size (in vivo: 27-45 x 15-30 urn vs. 40-70 x 25-40 urn)
as well as the number of micronuclei (2-3 vs. 1), pharyngeal rods (8-12 vs. 12-18), and
nassulid organelles (3—4 vs. 4—5) are different, but not to an extent making species status
indisputable. Thus, further populations should be studied, especially as concerns the number
of micronuclei, which might be a main and easy-to-recognize feature for separating these
minute species.
The generic assignment of our population is also questionable, that is, possibly it belongs to
Naxella. However, in the absence of detailed data on the pharyngeal basket, we prefer to
maintain the species in Nassula.
423

Nassula dragescoi nov. spec. (Fig. 98a-i; 347a-r; Table 79)
Diagnosis: Size about 80 x 40 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. Two types of extrusomes: fusiform,
3-5 urn long trichocysts and platelet-like, minute mucocysts. On average 61 ciliary rows and
10 nassulid organelles very widely spaced in left half of frange, which thus ends on right side
of cell and leaves many ciliary rows uninterrupted between the individual organelles.
Pharyngeal basket composed of 20-30 twisted rods extending to posterior third of cell.
Paroral membrane indistinct.
Type location: Highly saline soil from Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E (site 57 in
figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Dedication: We dedicate this new species to Prof. Dr. JeanDRAGESCO, who significantly
contributed to the knowledge of limnetic ciliates from Africa.
Description: Size 65-95 x 35-55 urn in vivo, as calculated from measurements of live
specimens and values shown in table 79, assuming a shrinkage of about 5% due to the
preparation procedures. Overall shape ellipsoidal, length:width ratio about 2:1, dorsoventrally
flattened up to 2:1, ventral side almost flat, dorsal more or less distinctly convex (Fig. 98a, f,
g). Macronucleus usually in middle third of cell, broadly ellipsoidal, with reticular nucleolus.
Micronuclei usually attached to macronucleus, globular. Contractile vacuole near mid-body,
surrounded by small contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pore in line with paroral
membrane. Cytopyge slit in line with excretory pore, near posterior body end, about 13 urn
long. Resting trichocysts attached almost perpendicularly to cortex, numerous and thus
forming distinct fringe, fusiform, about 5 x 0.6 urn in specimens from Namibian site (56) and
Benin, 3—4 urn in specimens from Namibian site (59). Resting mucocysts hardly recogniz-
able, produce bright, about 1 urn thick cortical layer, released as 1-2 um-sized, polygonal
platelets occasionally swelling to a voluminous, fibrous coat when methyl green-pyronin is
added (Fig. 347e, f, h). Cortex punctated by ciliary pits; cortical units usually hexagonal to
indistinctly rectangular, each containing a kinetid (Fig. 347g, k, 1). Cells blue-green due to
ingested cyanobacteria; cytoplasm colourless, but with numerous lipid droplets and conspicu-
ous citrine patch of about 1 um-sized granules in left anterior body portion. Feeds mainly on
cyanobacteria (Oscillatoria) digested in 4-10 um-sized food vacuoles becoming golden
during late digestion stages. Movement without peculiarities.
Ciliature loosened in posterior pole area and underneath paroral membrane; distances
between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in ciliary rows right of
oral opening and underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary rows meridionally and equidis-
tantly arranged, except for more closely spaced postoral kineties and first (paroral) and
second kinety, which usually end near the nassulid frange, respectively, near mid-body; form
indistinct preoral suture; occasionally shortened anteriorly and/or posteriorly and often more
or less distinctly interrupted on left and dorsal side, where the nassulid frange extends.
Postorganellar stripe distinct only on ventral side because most kineties continuous on left
and dorsal side due to the wide spacing of the nassulid organelles (Fig. 98h, i; 347k, 1, m, q;
Table 79).
Oral opening subapical. Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to dorsal side and posterior third
of cell, funnel-shaped, about 11 urn wide in vivo and slightly bulbous distally, composed of

longitudinally arranged dikinetids. NF - nassulid frange, PB - pharyngeal basket. Scale bars 20 um.
425

20-30 rather thin, twisted rods forming a tortuous bundle in posterior third in protargol
preparations; distal microtubular sheath very conspicuous after protargol impregnation;
annulus recognizable neither in vivo nor silver slides (Fig. 347a-c, i, p). Nassulid frange
sigmoidal and exceptionally long due to the wide spacing of the organelles in left (distal) half,
commences mid-ventrally and extends obliquely across dorsal surface terminating slightly
above mid-body on right side of cell; thus, both ends of frange visible when cell is viewed
ventrally (Fig. 98e; 347j, q; Table 79)! Nassulid organelles decrease in size from right to left,
composed of three kineties each, of which apparently only two bear cilia decreasing in length
from right to left within each organelle (Fig. 347o; Table 79). Paroral membrane rather
inconspicuous because composed of 5-10 longitudinally arranged dikinetids, continuous with
first somatic ciliary row, commences at level of oral opening and extends in a flat bow to the
nassulid frange (Fig. 98h; 347m).
Occurrence and ecology: Found in moderate numbers at the highly saline Namibian
sites (56-60) and in a non-saline soil sample taken by Prof. Dr. Jean DRAGESCO at the
Campus of Benin University, Abomay. Thus, N. dragescoi is euryhaline.

Generic classification and comparison with related species: Nassula
dragescoi has two unique features: (i) the nassulid frange is, due to the wide spacing of the
organelles in its left half, so long that both ends are visible when the cell is viewed ventrally
(Fig. 98e; 347q); (ii) the postorganellar stripe is distinct only on the ventral side and thus
many uninterrupted ciliary rows extend between the widely spaced nassulid organelles on the
left, dorsal, and right side (Fig. 98h, i; 347k, 1). Accordingly, N. dragescoi could even be
considered as a representative of a new genus. However, Nassula terricola FOISSNER, 1989,
-» N. granata, and —> N. tuberculata show transitions of these features. Thus, generic
separation seems inappropriate at the present state of knowledge.
The diagnosis and description summarize observations from six populations (five from
Namibia, one from Benin; see "occurrence and ecology"), which were studied with varying
precision during a period of one month. All populations were identical in the main features,
such as trichocysts and number and arrangement of the nassulid organelles.
Nassula dragescoi resembles Nassula citrea KAHL, 1931, as redescribed by EiSLER &
BARDELE (1986), in body shape, body size (80-120 x 40-50 urn), trichocysts, number of
ciliary rows (55), and the citrine granule patch in the left anterior body end. However, N.
citrea has only 4—7 nassulid organelles and the frange terminates on the left body side
because the organelles are much more closely spaced than in N. dragescoi (Fig. 98d, e).
Furthermore, the number of pharyngeal rods is rather different (20-30 vs. 34-38). Nassula
gutturata GAJEVSKAJA, 1927, a species from the littoral of Lake Baikal, is similar to N.
dragescoi in body size and trichocysts, but has a very distinct basket annulus (Fig. 98b),
which is very indistinct or even lacking in N. dragescoi (Fig. 98a; 347c, i, p). Unfortunately, a
more detailed comparison is impossible because GAJEVSKAJA (1927) did not provide any
information about the nassulid frange.
Nassula granata nov. spec. (Fig. 99a-p; 276-269, 348a-j; Table 80)
Diagnosis: Size about 90 x 35 urn in vivo. Shellcase-shaped in ventral, ovoidal in lateral
view, lanceolate when swimming for a while. Mucocysts minute, platelet-like. On average 47
ciliary rows and 8 nassulid organelles forming slightly sigmoidal frange terminating mid-
dorsally at or slightly above level of oral opening. Pharyngeal basket composed of about 27
almost straight rods extending to posterior third of cell. Type I resting cysts.
Typelocation: Highly saline soil from Etosha National Park, Namibia, 18°45'S 16°45'E
(site 69 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin noun granata refers to the peculiar, shellcase-like shape.
Description: Size 75-100 x 30-45 urn in vivo, as calculated from measurements of live
specimens and values shown in table 80, assuming a shrinkage of 10-20% due to preparation
procedures; length:width ratio about 2.5:1 in vivo, 2.1:1 in preparations, and up to 4:1 in
hyaline cells without food vacuoles (Fig. 99h). Shellcase-like in ventral and dorsal view, that
is, cylindroidal with evenly rounded posterior and broadly conical anterior end; ovoidal when
viewed laterally (Fig. 99a, d, e, h); specimens swimming for some time become lanceolate,
highly resembling Paraenchelys spp. (Fig. 99f, g). Macronucleus usually in middle third of

which form a tortuous bundle in the posterior third. No paroral dikinetids are recognizable (i, j; arrowhead), although the

rather thin, fluffy coat (n, o) when methyl green-pyronin is added, p: The globular resting cysts are orange due to countless
golden granules forming stripes in the cell periphery. The wall is smooth and covered with a mucous layer to which clay
particles and organic debris adhere. The pharyngeal basket is maintained and a vacuole with food remnants (asterisk) is in

429

cell, ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal, with reticular nucleolus. Micronuclei near or attached
to macronucleus, about 3 jam across in vivo. Contractile vacuole slightly above mid-body,
surrounded by small contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pore almost in line with
paroral membrane. Cytopyge slit in line with excretory pore, near posterior body end, about
15 jam long. Resting mucocysts hardly recognizable, produce bright, about 1 urn thick
cortical layer, released as 1-2 um-sized, polygonal platelets swelling to a thin, fluffy coat
when methyl green-pyronin is added (Fig. 99m-o; 348c, d). No trichocysts. Cortex slightly
punctated by ciliary pits. Cells greenish and/or golden due to ingested cyanobacteria and 0.2-
1 um-sized, greasily shining granules scattered in the cytoplasm and accumulated subapically
on dorsal side forming distinct, golden patch; cells without food vacuoles light yellow-orange.
Food vacuoles 5-11 urn across, contain cyanobacteria {Oscillatoria) partially turning into
golden granules, similar to those forming the dorsal patch, during late digestion stages.
Usually creeping between organic debris and Oscillatoria filaments, like many congeners;
when swimming for a while, it assumes the lanceolate "swimming shape" described above,
possibly due to environmental changes during observation.
Somatic cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, loosened in posterior pole area and underneath first
nassulid organelle; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior,
especially in ciliary rows right of oral opening. Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly
arranged, except for more closely spaced postoral kineties and first (paroral) and second
kinety, which usually end near the cytopyge. Preoral suture and postorganellar stripe
indistinct because kineties abut tightly preorally and extend close to the nassulid frange;
however, continuous ciliary rows, as in —» N. dragescoi, rarely occur (Fig. 99a-c, k, 1; 267-
269, 348g-i; Table 80).
Oral opening subapical. Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to dorsal side and posterior third
of cell, funnel-shaped, about 9 urn wide in vivo and slightly bulbous distally, composed of
about 27 rather thin, almost straight rods forming tortuous bundle in posterior third of
protargol-impregnated specimens; crests and distal microtubular sheath conspicuous only in
silver slides; annulus recognizable neither in vivo nor silver preparations (Fig. 99a, d-e, f, 1;
267-269, 348a, b, f). Nassulid frange slightly sigmoidal, invariably terminating mid-dorsally
at level, or even slightly anteriorly of oral opening. Nassulid organelles composed of three
kineties each, decrease in size from right to left, bear about 8 um long cilia; upper leftmost
basal body occasionally lacking (Fig. 99a-c; 348g, h; Table 80). Paroral membrane
(dikinetids) recognizable neither in silver carbonate preparations (Fig. 348i) nor the
excellently protargol-impregnated cell shown in figures 348i, j; basal bodies, however,
slightly more closely spaced at anterior end of kinety 1 than of kinety 2.
Resting cysts globular, about 50 urn across in vivo, orange due to citrine cytoplasm and
innumerable golden granules forming stripes in cell periphery; in cyst centre a large (about 17
urn across), yellow-brown vacuole with food remnants, usually even present in older cysts.
Wall smooth and colourless, frequently indistinctly bilaminar, about 3 urn thick, covered with
a mucous layer to which clay particles and organic debris adhere. Pharyngeal basket
maintained (Fig. 99p; 348j).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in slightly (0.5%o) to highly saline soils
of the Etosha Pan region (sites 54, 64, 67, 69).
Comparison with related species: The diagnosis and description summarize
observations from populations of Namibian sites (67) and (69) studied during a period of one
430

month. Both populations are identical in the main features, such as shellcase-like body shape,
lack of trichocysts, number of nassulid organelles, and structure of pharyngeal basket.
Nassula granata is rather close to a trichocyst-less, unnamed variety of N. citrea found by
KAHL (1931) in a saline habitat of northern Germany. We consider the redescription of//.
citrea by EiSLER & BARDELE (1986) as authoritative because it matches the trichocyst-
bearing N. citrea variety described by KAHL (1931). Nassula granata is easily distinguished
from N. citrea by the lack of trichocysts, the length of the nassulid frange (terminating mid-
dorsally vs. at left body side), and the number of pharyngeal rods (25-29 vs. 34—38). Nassula
terricola FOISSNER, 1989 differs from N. granata mainly in the resting cyst (ectocyst faceted
vs. smooth), while the active states are similar in body size, course of the nassulid frange,
indistinctness of the postorganellar stripe, and number of ciliary rows. Minor distinguishing
features are: body shape (broadly ellipsoidal vs. shellcase-like), length:width ratio (about
1.7:1 vs. 2.5:1 in vivo), macronucleus shape (globular vs. ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal),
the granule patch (lacking vs. present), and the number of micronuclei (1 vs. 2-3), pharyngeal
rods (about 20 vs. 25-29), and nassulid organelles (9-13 vs. 5-9). Our species is also
different from Nassula tumida MASKELL, 1887, as redescribed by PUYTORAC & NJINE (1980;
see FOISSNER 1989 for a detailed discussion of this population), especially in several
morphometric features and in that the nassulid frange terminates at oral opening level.

b Of 15 Nassula granata specimens investigated, three have 3 micronuclei.
Generic classification: Nassula granata has a special course of the nassulid frange,
which extends almost parallel to the body perimeter, terminating at level, or even slightly
anteriorly of the pharyngeal basket opening. In most other thoroughly studied Nassula s. str.
species the nassulid frange invariably extends more or less distinctly rearwards: —> Nassula
longinassa, —>• N. dragescoi, -> N. etoschensis, N. rotunda (FOISSNER 1980e), N. ornata
(FOISSNER et al. 1994), and N. citrea (EiSLER & BARDELE 1986; less distinct because frange is
short). Only in N. terricola extends the nassulid frange as in N. granata (FOISSNER 1989).
However, the special course of the frange in N. terricola is not as evident as in N. granata
because the species is broader and the frange does not extend onto the dorsal side. Both
species agree also in the indistinctness of the postorganellar stripe. There is, however, a
"strong" difference between N. terricola and N. granata, namely, the presence/absence of
paroral dikinetids. However, a reinvestigation of the type material ofN. terricola showed that
432

FOISSNER (1989) over-interpreted his slides, viz., considered the slightly narrowed spacing of
the kinetids in the anterior portion of kinety 1 as indication of paroral dikinetids. Such
dikinetids are recognizable neither in the silver nitrate stains nor in a silver carbonate
preparation (Fig. 350a). Actually, N. terricola and N. granata are identical in the
inconspicuousness or lack of paroral dikinetids (cp. figure 350b with 348i). They might be the
core of a distinct genus, possibly Rhinakis (see introduction to family). However, generic
separation would probably be too progressive at the present state of knowledge, and is
weakened by the different resting cysts in N. terricola and N. granata (see above and —>
Nassulides labiatus). As concerns Rhinakis, the number and course of the nassulid organelles
are rather different in R. faurei, N. terricola, and N. granata.
Nassula tuberculata nov. spec. (Fig. 100a-o; 349a-u, 350a, b; Tables 80, 81)
1996 Nassulapicta GREEFF, 1888 - FOISSNER, Acta Protozool., 35: 100 (misidentification).
Diagnosis: Size about 80 x 40 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. Mucocysts minute, platelet-like.
On average 41 ciliary rows and 8 nassulid organelles forming sigmoidal frange terminating
mid-dorsally at or slightly underneath level of oral opening. Pharyngeal basket composed of
about 25 slightly twisted rods extending to posterior third of cell. Type IV resting cysts.
Type location: Highly saline, cultivated soil from the Al-Hassa Oasis, Saudi Arabia,
25°30'N 49°40'E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective tuberculata refers to the tubercular wall of the resting
cyst.
Description: Active specimens from Saudi Arabia, Portugal, and Antarctica were
investigated. However, the diagnosis comprises only the Saudi Arabian population, in which
the resting cysts were studied, too. In the description, data are separated only when appropri-
ate. No permanent preparations are available from the Saudi Arabian population. Thus, we
declare figures 349a-u as type material. CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate-impregnated voucher
slides from the Portuguese material have been deposited (Table 1).
Size in vivo 70-100 x 30-50 urn in Saudi Arabian specimens, 60-80 x 30—40 urn in well-fed
Portuguese cells, only 40 urn in undernourished Portuguese cells, and about 70 x 23 urn in
Antarctic specimens; length:width ratio usually 2.2-2.3:1 in vivo, about 1.7:1 in silver nitrate-
impregnated Portuguese specimens. Overall shape slenderly (3:1) to broadly (1.8:1) ellipsoi-
dal, occasionally slightly ovoidal, usually more or less distinctly reniform and flattened up to
1.5:1 when viewed ventrolaterally or laterally (Fig. 100a-e; 349f, g; Tables 80, 81). Macro-
nucleus usually in middle third of cell, ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal, about 25 x 15 |xm in
vivo, finely granulated in Saudi Arabian specimens, with distinct, lobed nucleoli in cells from
Antarctica. Micronuclei attached to macronucleus, ellipsoidal to globular, about 3 x 2.5 urn in
vivo. Contractile vacuole slightly above mid-body, surrounded by small contributory vesicles
during diastole; excretory pore in line with or slightly left of first kinety. Cytopyge slit in line
with excretory pore, near posterior body end, about 16 urn long. No trichocysts, but muco-
cysts present in all populations investigated, produce bright, about 1 urn thick cortex; just
433

released mucocysts globular in the scanning electron microscope, platelet-like and swelling to
a more or less voluminous coat after addition of methyl green-pyronin (Fig. 349e, i). Cortex
punctated by ciliary pits and conspicuously pustulated in the scanning electron microscope,
possibly due to exploding mucocysts or preparation artifacts. Cells greenish or yellowish due
to cyanobacteria in various stages of digestion and citrine to ochre cytoplasmic granules 0.2-1
urn across; Portuguese specimens with diffuse, yellowish plasm colouration. Cytoplasmic
granules accumulated in left anterior portion of cell forming yellow to ochre patch, especially
conspicuous in hungry cells. Food vacuoles 3-15 urn across, contain filamentous cyanobacte-
ria (Oscillatoria), whose crystalline, orange remnants turn into yellow to golden granules,
similar to those forming the subapical patch, in the egestion vacuoles (Fig. 100g-i). Swims
rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Somatic cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, except for slightly elongated and loosened cilia in
posterior pole area; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior,
especially in ciliary rows right of oral opening and underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary
rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, except for more closely spaced postoral
kineties and first and second kinety. Preoral suture and postorganellar stripe indistinct
because kineties abut tightly preorally and extend close to the nassulid frange; continuous
ciliary rows, as in —> N. dragescoi, occur only between the last two to three frange organelles.
Second kinety occasionally interrupted at level of oral opening or shortened posteriorly (Fig.
100 1, m; 349a-c; Tables 80, 81).
Oral opening subapical. Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to dorsal side and posterior third
of cell, funnel-shaped, distinctly bulbous and about 10 urn wide distally in vivo, composed of
approximately 25 rather thin, about 40 urn long and slightly twisted rods; distal microtubular
sheath distinct only in silver nitrate preparations; annulus recognizable neither in vivo nor
silver preparations (Fig. 100a, k-o; 349a-d). Nassulid frange sigmoidal, terminates mid-
dorsally at or slightly below level of oral opening, usually composed of 8 organelles in Saudi
Arabian, 7 in Portuguese, and 5 in Antarctic specimens. Nassulid organelles composed of
three kineties each, decrease in size from right to left, that is, first organelle with 7-12 basal
bodies per kinety, last with 2-4. Length of cilia increases within each organelle from right to
left; longest cilia about 15 urn, that is, almost twice the length of ordinary somatic cilia (Fig.
100 1-n; 349a, b, f, h, j; Table 80). Paroral membrane (dikinetids) not recognizable in silver
nitrate and silver carbonate preparations; basal bodies, however, slightly more closely spaced
at anterior end of kinety 1 than kinety 2 (Fig. 100 1, o; 349a, c).
Resting cysts globular, 45 x 44 urn on average in vivo, light citrine due to countless 1-3 um-
sized, yellowish fat globules occasionally forming distinct subcortical stripes (Fig. lOOj; 349
1-u; Table 80). Wall colourless and tubercular, 1-2 urn thick and rigid, very likely trilaminar,
covered by an about 10 urn thick, mucilaginous layer having some bacteria attached.
Tubercles above longitudinal and equidistant rows of bright dots (possibly basal bodies of
ciliary rows), 1-2 urn high, contain 2-3 granules or blunt rods 0.5-2 um in size. Cytoplasm
packed with yellowish fat globules mentioned above and a conspicuous vacuole about 12 urn
across with food remnants and yellow granules. Macronucleus ellipsoidal. Pharyngeal basket
maintained.

Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, where it was rather
abundant; in a saline soil from Portugal; and in mixed terrestrial and limnetic material (pH
4.0-5.2) from Ross Island, Antarctica, where the population was misidentified as Nassula
picta by FOISSNER (1996a; site 47). The slightly acidic (pH 6.0) sample from Saudi Arabia
was a mixture of litter (mainly from legumes planted for desalinization) and highly saline
(8%o), yellowish sand with many roots and patches of iron concretions. The Portuguese site
was saline grassland about 200 m inshore and behind a coastal dune in the surroundings of
Armacäo de Pera, a small town at the Algarve coast (37°N 08°W). This sample (pH 8.4)
consisted of the upper (0-3 cm) soil layer of a dry, flat pool with a white salt crust and of dry
algal crusts between halophytes. Obviously, N. tuberculata is a cosmopolitan species
occurring within a wide range of salinity and pH.
Comparison of populations and with related species: The Saudi Arabian,
Portuguese, and Antarctic population match in the main features, namely, the shape of the
nassulid frange; the number of ciliary rows, pharyngeal rods, and nassulid organelles; the
coloured granule patch; the lack of trichocysts; and the indistinctness of the postorganellar
stripe. The Saudi Arabian specimens are slightly larger than those from Portugal and
Antarctica (70-100 urn vs. 60-80 urn) and have more kinetids in a dorsal ciliary row (about
48 vs. 37 and 44). These differences are insignificant and thus conspecificity is beyond
reasonable doubt, although the most important feature, that is, the structure of the resting cyst
wall, could not be compared.

Nassula tuberculata, —» N. granata, and N. terricola are almost indistinguishable by
conventional morphological characteristics (Table 81), especially when the rather pronounced
variability is taken into account. Thus, reliable identification needs the resting cysts, whose
wall structure is conspicuously different: tubercular in N. tuberculata, smooth in —» N.
granata (Fig. 348j), and with distinct ridges in N. terricola (re-checked in the type slides,
which contain many cysts clearly showing that they are different from those of N.
tuberculata).
Admittedly, the alpha-taxonomical value of resting cysts is poorly known. The data available
indicate that they are often not species but only genus or family-specific. On the other hand,
FOISSNER (1993c) represented an excellent example of resting cyst wall differences in
Colpoda cucullus and C. flavicans, two species as similar in conventional morphological
features as Nassula tuberculata, -> N. granata, and N. terricola. A further example is
provided by various Stylonychia species (FOISSNER & BERGER 1999). Thus, we feel justified
in separating these three Nassula populations at species level by the cyst wall structure.
Alternatively, they can be considered as sibling species of a "Nassula terricola-corrvplex".
Nassula etoschensis nov. spec. (Fig. 101a-j; 350c-g; Table 82)
Diagnosis: Size about 100x65 urn in vivo; broadly ellipsoidal. Two types of extrusomes:
fusiform, about 5 urn long trichocysts and platelet-like, minute mucocysts. On average 84
ciliary rows. Nassulid frange sigmoidal, terminating near anterior quarter of left body margin,
composed of on average 6 organelles closely spaced in right and widely in left half of frange.
Pharyngeal basket composed of about 18 straight, widely spaced rods extending to mid-body.
Paroral membrane conspicuous, composed of about 10 dikinetids.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 18°50'S 16°30'E
(site 67 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the area discovered.
Description: Size 80-120 x 50-75 urn in vivo, as calculated from measurements of live
specimens and values shown in table 82, assuming a shrinkage of about 10-20% due to the
preparation procedures. Overall shape broadly ellipsoidal, rarely obovoidal, with shallow
furrow underneath nassulid frange; length:width ratio about 1.5:1 both in vivo and after silver
nitrate impregnation (Fig. 101a, h). Macronucleus usually in middle third of cell, about 30 x
25 urn in vivo, surrounded by a distinct membrane, with reticular nucleolus. Up to 6 globular
micronuclei near or attached to macronucleus; exact number difficult to count because of
many similarly sized and impregnated cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole slightly
above mid-body, surrounded by small contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pore
usually in line with kinety 2. Cytopyge slit in line with excretory pore, near posterior body
end, about 21 urn long. Resting trichocysts attached almost perpendicularly to cortex, rather
sparse and thus not forming distinct fringe, fusiform, about 5 x 0.7-1 urn; exploded tricho-
cysts rod-shaped and slightly curved, up to 25 x 0.5 urn (Fig. lOli, j; 350e). Resting muco-
cysts hardly recognizable, produce bright, about 1 urn thick cortical layer, released as 1-2
urn-sized, polygonal platelets when methyl green-pyronin is added. Cells greenish and/or
orange due to ingested cyanobacteria and inconspicuous patch of orange granules (indeed,

0.2-1 um-sized lipid droplets) subapically on dorsal side; cells without food vacuoles golden.
Feeds mainly on filamentous cyanobacteria digested in 4—20 um-sized food vacuoles
changing from blue-green to orange during late digestion stages. Movement without
peculiarities.
Somatic cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, slightly elongated and distinctly loosened in posterior
pole area; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in
ciliary rows right of oral opening and underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary rows
meridionally and equidistantly arranged, except for more closely spaced kineties right and left
of oral opening and underneath first nassulid organelle, form distinct preoral suture and
postorganellar stripe both about 2-3 urn wide; kinety 2 occasionally shortened anteriorly
terminating at level of mid-oral opening with clockwise inclined dikinetids at level of
postorganellar stripe (Fig. lOld, e; Table 82).
Oral opening subapical, membranous and fusiform. Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to
dorsal side and mid-body, funnel-shaped, about 10 urn wide in vivo and not bulbous distally,
composed of approximately 18 thick, straight, and comparatively widely spaced rods with
shallow indentation anteriorly; distal microtubular sheath and annulus recognizable neither in
vivo nor silver slides (Fig. 101a, c, f; 350b-d). Nassulid frange commences mid-ventrally and
extends sigmoidally across ventral side terminating slightly below anterior quarter of left
body margin; usually composed of 6 organelles closely spaced and sigmoidally arranged in
right half of frange, widely spaced and step-like in left. Nassulid organelles composed of
three kineties each; first organelle long (composed of about 20 basal bodies) and curved,
others short (composed of 3-9 basal bodies) and straight (Fig. 101b, d, e; Table 82). Paroral
membrane conspicuous in silver nitrate and protargol preparations, continuous with first
ciliary row, commences at level of mid-oral opening and extends in a flat bow to post-
organellar stripe, composed of about 10 clockwise inclined dikinetids (Fig. 10Id).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in highly saline soils of the Etosha Pan
region (sites 54, 65, 67).
Comparison with related species: Several nassulids resemble N. etoschensis,
especially N. citrea and Nassulides pictus. Nassula citrea KAHL, 1931, as redescribed by
EiSLER & BARDELE (1986), matches N. etoschensis in body size, trichocysts, and number of
nassulid organelles (4-7); both, however, differ markedly in the length:width ratio (about
2.2:1 vs. 1.5:1) and the number of ciliary rows (55 vs. 72-92) and pharyngeal rods (34-38 vs.
15-19). Furthermore, the nassulid frange of N. citrea is composed of almost equidistantly
spaced organelles and has a different course, that is, extends almost straight or in a flat bow to
the left body side.
At first glance, N. etoschensis resembles Nassulides pictus because of the similar size and
shape. However, they can be easily separated, even in vivo, by the trichocysts (lacking in N.
pictus according to the authoritative redescriptions by FOISSNER 1980e, 1989 and FOISSNER et
al. 1994) and the pharyngeal basket (composed of about 18 straight and widely spaced rods
vs. about 24 twisted, closely spaced rods). Furthermore, pictus belongs to the genus
Nassulides (see introduction to family). KAHL (1931) and VUXANOVici (1962a) briefly
mentioned trichocyst-bearing populations ofN. pictus. VUXANOVICI'S specimens (Fig. 101g)
are similar to N. etoschensis in body shape, body size (about 80 urn), and number of
pharyngeal rods (12-14), but differ rather distinctly in the number of ciliary rows (about 28-
30 vs. 36-46 on one side of cell). Unfortunately, a more detailed comparison is impossible
440

because VUXANOVICI (1962a) did not provide any information about the nassulid frange.
Nassula gutturata GAJEVSKAJA, 1927, a species from the littoral of Lake Baikal, differs from
N. etoschensis mainly in the very distinct basket annulus, which is inconspicuous or even
lacking in N. etoschensis (cp. figure 99b with figures 101c and 350d).

ellipsoidal, with reticular nucleolus. Micronuclei adjacent to macronucleus, globular, difficult
to distinguish from similarly sized cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole near mid-
body, surrounded by small contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pore at end of
kinety 2. Cytopyge slit underneath excretory pore, extends to near posterior body end, about
15 urn long. Resting trichocysts attached almost perpendicularly to cortex, equidistantly
arranged in longitudinal rows, form distinct fringe, fusiform (Fig. 102a, c, d; 351b-e, j, k):
large type 6-9 x 0.7-1 urn and sparse, small type 3-4 x 0.5-0.7 urn and numerous. Occur-
rence of mucocysts not investigated. Cortex about 1 urn thick and bright, punctated by ciliary
pits and trichocysts. Cells greenish and/or yellow-brown due to ingested cyanobacteria and
citrine patch of 0.2 um-sized granules in left anterior body portion. Feeds mainly on coccal
cyanobacteria digested in vacuoles 2-5 urn across.
Somatic cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, arise from shallow cortical pits, loosened in posterior
pole area; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in
second kinety and ciliary rows underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary rows longitudinally
and equidistantly arranged, except for more closely spaced postoral kineties and first (paroral)
and second kinety, which end near mid-body; leave blank an about 2 um wide stripe
underneath nassulid frange and form distinct preoral suture. Kinety 2 usually commences
with some dikinetids at level of mid-oral opening and ends at excretory pore of contractile
vacuole (Fig. 102b; 270, 35If, h, i; Table 83).
Oral opening subapical. Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to dorsal side and posterior end
of cell, funnel-shaped, composed of about 13 thick, untwisted rods with shallow indentation
anteriorly; annulus and distal microtubular sheath not recognizable in vivo and protargol
preparations. Distal basket region about 6-7 urn wide, composed of heavily impregnated,
ellipsoidal structures (seemingly?) connected by a ring-shaped, membranous structure (Fig.
102a, e, f; 270, 35If, h, i, k). Nassulid frange extends slightly obliquely posteriad on ventral
side, invariably composed of three staggered organelles. Nassulid organelles composed of
three kineties each, decrease in size from right to left, that is, first organelle with about 10-13
cilia per kinety, last with only three to five; length of cilia increases from about 7 urn at right
to about 10 urn at left end of organelles (Fig. 102a, b; 270, 351a, f, h, i, k; Table 83). Paroral
membrane rather conspicuous, continuous with first somatic ciliary row, commences at level
of oral opening and extends in flat bow to blank stripe underneath nassulid frange, composed
of about 12-14 clockwise inclined dikinetids (Fig. 102a, b; 270, 351a, f, h, i).
Occurrence and ecology: TUCOLESCO (1962) discovered Naxella rosea in a
freshwater affluent to a Romanian lake. We found it in highly saline soils of the Etosha Pan
region (sites 57, 70). Thus, N. rosea seems to be a euryhaline and cosmopolitan species.
Comparison with original description and related species: Assigned to
genus Naxella for reasons explained in introduction to family. In vivo difficult to distinguish
from —»• Nassula longinassa. The Namibian population resembles two species, Nassula rosea
TUCOLESCO, 1962 (Fig. 102g) and -> Nassula lucida REUTER, 1961. The description of N.
rosea is based on live observations of a single specimen. Thus, it is fairly incomplete and
lacks, for instance, information about nassulid organelles and pharyngeal rods. However, our
population matches this species in an important feature, namely, the occurrence of two types
of trichocysts ("les uns vigoureux et rares, les autres plus fins et plus serres"; TUCOLESCO
1962). Furthermore, shape and size (length 55-69 urn after TUCOLESCO 1962) are very
similar. Only the colour (grey-pink vs. greenish to yellow-brown) and the habitat (freshwater
443

vs. highly saline soil) are different. Colour is a weak feature in nassulids because it depends
on food organisms and life cycle. The habitat is a more serious difference. However, some
(many?) nassulids are euryhaline, as exemplified by -> Nassulides labiatus. Our population
also resembles -» Nassula lucida REUTER, 1961, especially in body shape, colour (bright
yellow-orange), habitat (rock-pools; NaCl 0.1-21.6%o), and number of pharyngeal rods (14).
However, REUTER (1961) did not mention two types of trichocysts. Thus, we prefer identify-
ing our population with N. rosea TUCOLESCO, 1962, while another, similar population with
only one type of trichocysts and only two nassulid organelles matches —> N. lucida REUTER,
1961.
Naxella rosea differs from its congeners in the trichocysts (only one type in —> Naxella lucida
and N. australis FOISSNER & O'DONOGHUE, 1990; lacking in N. minima DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS, 1986), the number of nassulid organelles (only two in -» N. lucida; 5-8
in N. minima, which thus belongs very likely to Nassula), and in the location of the excretory
pore of the contractile vacuole (distinctly left of paroral membrane and underneath first or
second nassulid organelle in N. faurei FOISSNER & O'DONOGHUE, 1990). There are two other
similarly sized nassulids, —> Nassula parva KAHL, 1928 and N. pusilla KAHL, 1931; however,
these species lack trichocysts (at least, none were mentioned by KAHL) and should thus not be
identified (synonymized) with Naxella rosea.
Cyclogramma viridis DINGFELDER, 1962 is probably a senior synonym of Naxella faurei
FOISSNER & O'DONOGHUE, 1990 because it is very similar in shape, size, number of nassulid
organelles (not mentioned by DINGFELDER but his assignment of the species to Cyclogramma
implies three nassulid organelles), and freshwater habitat (DINGFELDER 1962, FAURE-
FREMIET 1967, FOISSNER & O'DONOGHUE 1990).

Neotype material: Neotypified from Namibian site (67) population, according to
reasons 1, 2, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 55-75 x 3(M5 urn in vivo; broadly ellipsoidal. Two

mucocysts. On average 35 ciliary rows and 13 pharyngeal rods extending to posterior body
end. 2 nassulid organelles underneath oral area. Paroral membrane distinct, composed of
about 13 dikinetids.

length:width ratio about 1.6:1, dorsoventrally slightly flattened (Fig. 103a, b). Macronucleus
usually in posterior half of cell, about 14 urn across in vivo, with reticular nucleolus.
Micronuclei adjacent to macronucleus, ellipsoidal, about 1-2 x 0. 5-1 urn in silver carbonate-
impregnated specimens; difficult to distinguish from similarly sized cytoplasmic inclusions.
Contractile vacuole near mid-body, surrounded by small contributory vesicles during diastole;
excretory pore near end of second kinety. Cytopyge slit underneath excretory pore, extends to
near posterior body end, about 15 urn long; food remnants leave cell as fluffy bale (Fig.
352f). Resting trichocysts attached almost perpendicularly to cortex within ciliary rows, form
distinct fringe, fusiform, about 5 x 0.6 urn (Fig. 103a, c; 352c, e). Resting mucocysts hardly
recognizable, produce bright, about 1 urn thick cortical layer, released as 1-2 um-sized,
polygonal platelets, which form a membranous cover when methyl green-pyronin is added
(Fig. 352d). Cells blue-green to orange-yellow due to ingested cyanobacteria in various stages
of digestion and golden patch of about 1 um-sized, greasy granules in anterior portion of
dorsal side. Feeds mainly on filamentous cyanobacteria digested in vacuoles 3-20 urn across
(Fig. 352a, e). Swims rapidly.
Somatic cilia 10-12 urn long in vivo, loosened in posterior pole area; distances between
individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in second kinety and ciliary
rows underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary rows longitudinally and equidistantly
arranged, except for more closely spaced postoral kineties and first (paroral) and second
kinety, which end slightly above mid-body; form short, but distinct preoral suture and
postorganellar stripe both about 3 urn wide. Second kinety with some dikinetids in anterior
portion, commences at level of mid-oral opening; occasionally kineties 3 and 4 also shortened
anteriorly (Fig. 103d, e; 352a, c; Table 83).
Oral opening subapical, fusiform; a hyaline cortical lip covers right third of oral area (Fig.
352a, e). Pharyngeal basket extends obliquely to dorsal side and posterior end of cell, funnel-
shaped, composed of about 13 thick, untwisted rods; annulus and distal microtubular sheath
not recognizable in vivo and protargol preparations. Distal basket region about 5 urn wide, of
same structure as in —» Naxella rosea, that is, composed of heavily impregnated, ellipsoidal
structures (seemingly?) connected by a ring-shaped, membranous structure (Fig. 352a, b).
Nassulid frange underneath oral area, invariably composed of only two organelles arranged
parallel to frange axis. Both organelles consist of three kineties each, which are composed of
12-13 cilia in first and 5-7 cilia in second organelle; length of cilia increases from about 5
urn at right to 12 urn at left end of organelles (Fig. 103d, e; 352a, c, f; Table 83). Paroral
membrane rather conspicuous in silver nitrate, silver carbonate, and protargol preparations;
continuous with first somatic ciliary row, commences at level of oral opening and extends in
flat bow to postorganellar stripe, composed of about 11—14 clockwise inclined dikinetids with
5 urn long cilia (Fig. 103a, d, e; 352a, c).
Occurrence and ecology: REUTER (1961) discovered Naxella lucida in rock-pools
(NaCl 0.1-21.6%o) at the Finnish coast. We found few specimens in highly saline soil from
the margin of the Etosha Pan (site 67). Thus, N. lucida is very likely euryhaline and cosmo-
politan.
Comparison with original description and related species. Assigned to
genus Naxella for reasons explained in introduction to family. The Namibian specimens
resemble Nassula lucida REUTER, 1961, whose description is entirely based on live observa-
tion. Thus, it is fairly incomplete, that is, lacks information about ciliary rows and nassulid
447

organelles, which REUTER (1961) could not "feststellen" (~ recognize). Our population
matches N. lucida in some important characters, namely, the presence of trichocysts, the
number of pharyngeal rods (14), and the saline habitat. The few differences remaining,
namely, body shape (broadly ellipsoidal vs. ovoidal with bluntly pointed anterior end) and
size (40-60 urn vs. 70-80 urn) are inconspicuous and insufficient to separate the populations.
Our specimens also resemble Nassula sp. found by THOMPSON (1978) in a meltwater pool on
King George Island (South Shetland Islands; Fig. 103g): both have only two nassulid
organelles and a similar size in silver nitrate preparations (32-50 x 24—31 urn vs. 43-59 x
20-35 urn); however, the number of ciliary rows is slightly different (32-37 vs. 40-45).
Unfortunately, THOMPSON (1978) gives no information about extrusomes and number of
pharyngeal rods. Thus, his population cannot be definitely assigned.
Naxella lucida differs from its congeners mainly by the number of nassulid organelles: three
in N. australis FOISSNER & O'DONOGHUE, 1990 and —» TV. rosea, as redescribed above; three
to four in N.faurei FOISSNER & O'DONOGHUE, 1990; five to eight in N. minima DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS, 1986, which thus very likely belongs to Nassula. There are also two
similarly sized Nassula species: —> N. longinassa (6-8 nassulid organelles) and N. pusilla
KAHL, 1931 (about 40 pharyngeal rods).

Neotype material: Neotypified from a cultivated population of a saline grassland soil
about 200 m inshore and behind a coastal dune in the surroundings of Armacäo de Pera, a
small town at the Algarve coast, Portugal (37°N 08°W), according to reasons 1-4, 6 discussed
in chapter 2.4.2.
Synonymy and comparison of populations: Nassula halophila GURWITSCH,
1934 is virtually identical to N. labiatus in morphology and habitat (Fig. 104c). Thus, it is
synonymized with that species. Several populations of N. labiatus have been studied
(BORROR 1972, DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986, KAHL 1933, SONG & WEI 1998).
They are very similar and match the Portuguese and Namibian specimens well, especially in
body shape, trichocysts, and length of first nassulid organelle, as well as in the number of
448

somatic ciliary rows, nassulid organelles, and pharyngeal rods. In contrast, most metric
features show strong interpopulation variability, for instance, body size, which is conspicu-
ously smaller in the Namibian specimens (Table 84). The improved diagnosis given below
summarizes the data available, including the detailed results from the Portuguese and
Namibian populations.
Improved diagnosis: Size usually 85-220 x 65-145 urn in vivo; broadly ellipsoidal.
Two types of extrusomes: fusiform, about 4 urn long trichocysts and platelet-like, minute
mucocysts. Usually 130-170 ciliary rows and 12-18 nassulid organelles extending onto
dorsal side of cell. Pharyngeal basket usually composed of 28-35 rods extending to posterior
body third. Paroral membrane indistinct. Type II resting cysts.
Description: We document this species by an abundance of micrographs, which are not
available in the literature. In contrast, excellent illustrations of the infraciliature were
provided by DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986). Thus, we show it by only one drawing
(Fig. 104b) and refer to DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) and the micrographs for
further information. Most of the observations are from a Portuguese population, which could
be cultivated on Eau de Volvic and filamentous cyanobacteria as food source. The culture
also contained several other ciliates.
Size in vivo about 200 urn in German population (KAHL 1933), 190-200 x 135-140 urn in
Russian (GURWITSCH 1934), 160-280 urn in Benin (DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986),
80-180 x 50-110 urn in Chinese (SONG & WEI 1998), 80-185 x 50-125 urn in Portuguese,
and 75-105 x 60-80 urn in Namibian population. Size of silver nitrate-impregnated speci-
mens 117-154 x 83-106 urn (BORROR 1972), 110-175 urn (FRYD-VERSAVEL cited in
DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986), and 94-199 x 70-180 urn (DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986), which matches the Portuguese population very well (101-175 x
75-118 urn), but is considerably larger than that of the Namibian specimens (71-99 x 58-75
urn). Overall shape broadly ellipsoidal to obovoidal, length:width ratio after silver nitrate
impregnation 1.5:1 in North American (BORROR 1972), 1.4:1 in Portuguese, and 1.3:1 in
Namibian population (Table 84); cultivated specimens from Portuguese population often
obliquely truncate preorally producing rounded triangular outline as depicted in figures 104a,
f, g. Macronucleus usually in middle third of cell, broadly ellipsoidal, about 45 x 35 urn in
vivo, with reticular nucleolus, surrounded by distinct, about 1 urn thick membrane in
Portuguese specimens. Usually 5-7, according to DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986)
up to 16 micronuclei adjacent to macronucleus; individual micronuclei about 5 urn across in
vivo and difficult to distinguish from similarly sized cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile
vacuole near or slightly above mid-body, surrounded by small contributory vesicles during
diastole; excretory pore almost in line with first kinety, about 2.5 urn in diameter. Cytopyge
slit underneath excretory pore, extends to posterior body end, about 27 urn long. Resting
trichocysts attached almost perpendicularly to cortex, fusiform, about 4 x 0.6-0.7 urn, rather
numerous forming more or less distinct fringe; exploded trichocysts also fusiform but up to
40 urn long and 1.5 urn wide, with minute, compact tip (Fig. 104a, i, j; 353u-w). Resting
mucocysts hardly recognizable, produce bright, about 1 urn thick cortical layer, only rarely
released when methyl green-pyronin is applied, appearing as 1-2 um-sized, polygonal
platelets swelling to a voluminous, up to 100 urn thick coat (Fig. 104k; 353x-z). Cortex about
1 urn thick and bright, indistinctly separated from cytoplasm. Cortical units pentagonal to
hexagonal, each containing a heavily impregnated granule (very likely a basal body) and
usually one posteriorly situated bright hole, either the parasomal sac or a trichocyst attach

ment site; units large and irregularly elliptical around nassulid organelles (Fig. 104h; 353r-t).
Cells orange or brownish due to ingested cyanobacteria and innumerable, about 0.2 um-sized
granules forming distinct, golden patch in left anterior body portion of Portuguese specimens
(Fig. 104a); granules very likely residues of filamentous cyanobacteria digested in vacuoles
8-40 urn across. Movement without peculiarities.
Somatic cilia about 13 urn long, in posterior pole area slightly elongated and loosely
arranged; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in
ciliary rows underneath first nassulid organelle. Ciliary rows longitudinally and equidistantly
arranged, except for more closely spaced postoral kineties and rows underneath leftmost
nassulid organelles; form indistinct preoral suture, but rather distinct, 2-3 um wide post-
organellar stripe. Number of ciliary rows fairly similar in all populations: 120-165 in North
American (BORROR 1972), 140-160 in French (FRYD-VERSAVEL cited in DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986), 140-200 in Benin (DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986),
about 150 in Chinese (SONG & WEI 1998), 133-192 in Portuguese, and 108-158 in Namibian
specimens (Fig. 104b; 353b, c, f-j, m, n; Table 84).
Oral opening in anterior quarter of cell, membranous and fusiform. Pharyngeal basket extends
obliquely to dorsal side and posterior third of cell, about 25 um wide and bulbous distally due
to the microtubular sheath, basket annulus distinct and recognizable even in vivo; composed
of about 25 (GURWITSCH 1934), 25-30 (BORROR 1972) or 30-40 rods (DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986), which matches the Portuguese (29-30) and Namibian (29-32)
populations. Rods not twisted, about 1.5 urn thick, with shallow indentation anteriorly and
conspicuous crests winding around whole basket length (Fig. 104a, e; 353 1, 354a, e, f; Table
84). Nassulid frange extends in flat bow onto dorsal side and terminates near mid-body,
composed of 13 (BORROR 1972), 12-15 (FRYD-VERSAVEL cited in DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-
KERNEIS 1986), 16-19 (DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986) or 14-16 organelles (SONG
& WEI 1998), which matches the Portuguese (12-18) and Namibian (13-15; n = 2) speci-
mens; rightmost organelles overlapping proximally because closely spaced and obliquely
orientated to main axis of frange, left organelles more widely spaced and orientated parallel to
frange. First nassulid organelle 10-12 urn long and curved, other organelles only 3-5 urn
long and straight; individual organelles composed of three kineties and usually unciliated in
right quarter, length of cilia decreases from about 20 urn at left to about 17 urn at right end of
organelles (Fig. 104b; 353f-i, o, q; Table 84). Paroral membrane continuous with first kinety,
indistinct, that is, only some closely spaced basal bodies are recognizable after silver
impregnation (Fig. 104b; 353 1).
Resting cysts globular, on average 98 urn across, deep-orange due to countless granules about
0.2 urn across (Fig. 104m; 354g-k, n, o; Table 84). Wall smooth, colourless, trilaminar, 3-5
urn thick, except for a small, thickened and protruding area, probably the emergence site.
Ectocyst 0.5-1 urn thick, mesocyst 3-4 urn, endocyst 1-2 urn and opaque; ectocyst and
endocyst connected by conspicuous, Z-shaped filaments, each possibly related in some way to
a somatic basal body because the infraciliary pattern is mirrored by these structures, except
for the nassulid organelles, where only two of the three basal body rows are associated with
Z-filaments (Fig. 104 1, m; 354j-n). However, when encysted specimens occasionally retract
from the cyst wall, the filaments remain between ecto- and endocyst, indicating that they are
weakly, or not at all, connected with the basal bodies (Fig. 354j, k). Cytoplasm with innumer-
able, orange granules, as described above; many colourless fat globules 2-5 urn across; some
clear, large vesicles; and few dark food inclusions. Pharyngeal basket and trichocysts
452

maintained.
Information about nassulid resting cysts is sparse; however, four types of walls can be
distinguished (Fig. 104 1-q): (i) smooth and amorphous in Nassula hesperidae (ENTZ 1884),
Parafurgasonia sorex (PENARD 1922), —> Nassula granata, and possibly Nassulides pictus as
described by PENARD (1922) and BUSSERS (1976); (ii) punctated in infraciliary pattern and
with Z-shaped filaments in Nassula ambigua (STEIN 1854) and Nassulides labiatus; (iii)
faceted due to distinct ridges in Nassula ornata (FABRE-DOMERGUE 1888), Furgasonia
trichocystis (now theresae; FAURE-FREMIET 1967), Nassula terricola (FOISSNER 1989),
Obertrumia aurea (FOISSNER et al. 1994), and Parafurgasonia protectissima (PENARD 1922);
(iv) tubercular in -» Nassula tuberculata. The cyst wall of Nassulides labiatus is most similar
to that of Nassula ambigua, a species, which has not yet been redescribed.
Occurrence and ecology: KAHL (1933) discovered Nassulides labiatus in a sea water
channel on the Island of Sylt, Germany. Later, it was found in brackish waters of Russia
(GURWITSCH 1934), tropical Africa (DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986), the Baltic Sea
(CZAPIK & FYDA 1992), and the USA (BORROR 1972b) as well as in marine waters of China,
where it formed red tides (SONG & WEI 1998). These records agree with our findings, that is,
the neotype location contains many flat pools, most of which were dry and had a white salt
crust when the material was collected. The sample consisted of the upper (0-3 cm) soil layer
and of algal crusts between halophytes; it was highly saline and had pH 8.4. Likewise, N.
labiatus was found only in the highly saline soils from sites (54, 56, 57, 58, 70) of the Etosha
Pan region. Thus, N. labiatus is euryhaline and cosmopolitan and probably restricted to
marine environments and saline inland biotopes.

Comparison with related species: Nassulides labiatus differs from its congeners
mainly in the number of nassulid organelles, which is distinctly lower in N. pictus (7-8;
FOISSNER 1980e, 1989, FOISSNER et al. 1994) and N. vernalis (8-10; FOISSNER 1989), but
considerably higher in N. pratensis (27-29; DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986). A
further difference concerns the number of somatic ciliary rows, which is distinctly lower in N.
pictus (37-50; FOISSNER 1980e, 1989, FOISSNER et al. 1994) and N. vernalis (48-65;
FOISSNER 1989). Nassulides labiatus resembles Nassula sp., found by THOMPSON (1972) in a
meltwater pool of the Antarctic Peninsula, in the oblique orientation of the rightmost nassulid
organelles, body size (silver-impregnated: 103-148 x 66-109 jam), and number of nassulid
organelles (12-16) and somatic ciliary rows (95-120); however, both differ slightly in the
number of pharyngeal rods (25-32 vs. 20). Unfortunately, THOMPSON (1972) gives no
information about extrusomes. Thus, his population cannot be definitely assigned. Nassulides
labiatus is also similar to several Nassula species: N. enormis VUXANOVICI, 1962a (length
250-270 urn; possibly a senior synonym of N. pratensis), N pluvialis DiNGFELDER, 1962 (18
pharyngeal rods; possibly a junior synonym of N. labiatus), N. rotunda GELEI, 1950 (very
454

similar to N. labiatus, but a true Nassula according to the redescription by FOISSNER 1980e),
and N. nahchivanica ALEKPEROV, 1984 (length 250-300 urn, 17 pharyngeal rods, 35 nassulid
organelles; and a true Nassula according to the arrangement of the nassulid organelles).

1979 Furgasoniidae CORLISS, The ciliated protozoa: 226.
Improved diagnosis: Small to medium-sized nassulids with usually conspicuous
pharyngeal basket extending posteriorly. Up to 3 nassulid organelles restricted to basket area
and composed of more or less numerous ciliary rows with usually 3 basal bodies each. Paroral
membrane distinct.
Type genus (by monotypy): Furgasonia JANKOWSKJ, 1964.
Remarks: The diagnosis of the Furgasoniidae has been improved because the family
enlarged since it was established by CORLISS (1979), and a related family, the —>
Colpodidiidae FOISSNER, 1995, was discovered. Now, the Furgasoniidae comprise four
genera: -> Furgasonia JANKOWSKI, 1964; -> Parafurgasonia FOISSNER & ADAM, 1981;
Urliella FOISSNER, 1989; and —>• Wolfkosia, a new genus described below.
Members of the Furgasoniidae and Colpodidiidae may look very similar at first glance due to
the nassulid organelles restricted to the basket area, the distinct paroral membrane, and the
similar body shape and size [see also introduction to family Colpodidiidae and "comparison
with similar species" under —» Apocolpodidium (Apocolpodidium) etoschense]. Indeed, these
families differ only in one main feature, namely, the oral basket, which extends posteriorly in
the former and anteriorly in the latter.
Certainly, several furgasoniids highly resemble ordinary Nassulidae, to which they were
formerly assigned. However, the fine structure of the nassulid organelles is different (GRAIN
et al. 1978, EiSLER 1986, 1988, 1989), although they appear very similar in the light
microscope, and the somatic ciliary pattern shows an important difference easily recognizable
in silver preparations: the ciliary rows left of the oral apparatus are uninterrupted in the
Furgasoniidae and Colpodidiidae, while intersected by the nassulid organelles in the
Nassulidae.

organelles arranged radially around lower and left margin of oral opening.

1989 Furgasonia trichocystis (STOKES, 1894) — FOISSNER, Sber. Akad. Wiss. Wien, 196 (year 1987): 207
(neotypification).
Justification of synonymy: KAHL (1931), the first reviser of the group, could not
obtain the papers of FABRE-DOMERGUE (1889, 1891) and thus did not recognize the obvious
identity of Nassula theresae FABRE-DOMERGUE, 1889 and Nassula trichocystis STOKES, 1894.
Both descriptions match perfectly in all main features, such as body size and shape, nucleus,
location of the contractile vacuole, pharyngeal basket, and trichocysts (definitely mentioned
by FABRE-DOMERGUE in the description). Furthermore, the descriptions match the
redescription by FOISSNER (1989), who neotypified the species. Thus, we synonymize
Nassula trichocystis STOKES, 1894 with N. theresae FABRE-DOMERGUE, 1889 and transfer the
species to the genus Furgasonia: Furgasonia theresae (FABRE-DOMERGUE, 1889) nov. comb.
This action is in accordance with article 23.9. of the ICZN (1999).
Urliella FOISSNER, 1989
Improved diagnosis: Furgasoniidae CORLISS, 1979 without nassulid organelles.
Type species (by original designation): Urliella terricola FOISSNER, 1989.
Remarks: This genus is unique among the nassulids because it lacks nassulid organelles.
FOISSNER (1989) also mentions two minor features, viz. the nearly apical location of the oral
apparatus and the position of the paroral membrane right of the oral opening. Both features
are now outdated because other genera show transitions in these characters (FOISSNER 1999b,
present work).
457

Parafurgasonia FOISSNER & ADAM, 1981
Improved diagnosis: Furgasoniidae CORLISS, 1979 with single distinct nassulid
organelle underneath oral opening.
Type species (by original designation): Nassulasorex PENARD, 1922.
Remarks: FOISSNER & ADAM (1981) mention in the diagnosis also "paroral membrane
semicircular along anterior margin of oral opening". However, there are transitions in this
feature, suggesting that it should be removed from the genus diagnosis (FOISSNER 1999b).
A reinvestigation of P. sorex showed that the paroral is composed of dikinetids orientated
perpendicularly to the kinety axis (Fig. 355e-h). As in other furgasoniids, for instance, ->
Wolfkosia loeffleri, the posterior (left) basal body of the dikinetids often impregnates only
faintly, or not at all, probably because it is unciliated. In the preparations by FOISSNER &
ADAM (1981), obviously only the anterior (right) basal bodies impregnated and were thus
misinterpreted as dikinetids orientated parallel to kinety axis.
Wolfkosia nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Furgasoniidae CORLISS, 1979 with somatic kinety 1 bipartited into long, C-
shaped, densely ciliated anterior portion and short, straight, sparsely ciliated posterior
fragment. 1 distinct and 1 or 2 indistinct nassulid organelles along posterior margin of oral
opening. Anterior fragment of kinety 1, paroral membrane, and nassulid organelles form
conspicuous, circular pattern around oral opening. Distal end of pharyngeal basket with teeth-
like projections.
Type species: Wolfkosia loeffleri nov. spec.
Etymology: Wilhelm FOISSNER dedicates this new genus to Dr. Wolfgang KOS
(Salzburg), an excellent surgeon, who made it possible that he could contribute to this work
(see also species dedication).
Classification and comparison with related genera: Wolfkosia belongs to
the Furgasoniidae, according to the features mentioned in the family diagnosis. It differs from
the other genera mainly by somatic kinety 1: bipartited with C-shaped anterior portion vs.
continuous and only slightly curved. Furthermore, a unique, circular oral pattern is created by
the particular location and shape of the anterior fragment of kinety 1, the paroral membrane,
and the nassulid organelles (Fig. 106m; 356q, r, t, u). The pharyngeal basket is also unique,
having a fish-snout like distal end, that is, a pattern which we have never seen in any other
nassulid (Fig. 106a, n; 356b, e, g, h). -> Furgasonia has like Wolfkosia three nassulid
organelles, which are, however, of same size and radially arranged around the lower and left
margin of the oral opening. —» Urliella lacks nassulid organelles entirely. —> Parafurgasonia
has only a single nassulid organelle. However, this difference must not be overinterpreted
because we cannot entirely exclude that the scattered basal bodies underneath the oral
opening of W. loeffleri do not represent nassulid organelles 1 and 2 but belong to nassulid
organelle 3. Thus, the particular pattern of the oral structures, especially the C-shaped anterior
458

fragment of kinety 1, distinguishes Wolfkosia from —» Parafurgasonia. As concerns separa-
tion from —> Apocolpodidium, see "comparison with similar species" below.
Wolfkosia loeffleri has as conspicuous mitochondria like most members of the family
Colpodidiidae. The Furgasoniidae lack such distinct mitochondria, at least the genera -»
Furgasonia and —» Parafurgasonia, which we reinvestigated for this feature. Indeed, the
mitochondria are hardly recognizable, although having a similar size and shape as in W.
loeffleri and —> Colpodidium spp., because they are much less refractive.
Wolfliosia loeffleri nov. spec. (Fig. 106a-o; 356a-z; Table 85)
Diagnosis: Size about 45 x 23 urn in vivo; obovoidal. Contractile vacuole underneath
subapical oral apparatus at end of C-shaped fragment of kinety 1. Extrusomes fusiform. On
average 14 somatic ciliary rows and 13 paroral dikinetids. C-shaped fragment of kinety 1 with
about 9 dikinetids. Pharyngeal basket composed of about 12-15 distinctly twisted rods.
Nassulid organelle 3 composed of approximately 6-9 ciliary rows.
Type location: Rock-pools at bank of Rio Corobici at the hacienda "La Pacifica"
(Centro Ecolögico "La Pacifica") near the town of Canas in Costa Rica, Central America,
10°28'N 85°10'W.
Etymology: Wilhelm FOISSNER dedicates this new species to Dr. Karl LÖFFLER
(Salzburg), who recognized, by simple palpation, the abdominal aneurysm Dr. Wolfgang KOS
later operated (see genus dedication).
Description: This small ciliate has a complex ciliary pattern. See figure 106m for a
semidiagrammatic interpretation and terminology.
Size 35-50 x 20-25 urn in vivo. Lateral view conspicuously obovoidal with minute subapical
process at oral apparatus; ventral and dorsal view ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal because
slightly to distinctly flattened laterally; when squeezed, preoral portion flattens (Fig. 106a, h,
i; 356g-i; Table 85). Macronucleus usually in middle third of cell, globular, with indistinct,
possibly reticular nucleolus. Micronucleus usually attached to macronucleus, globular.
Contractile vacuole in second quarter of cell, surrounded by contributory vesicles during
diastole, with short canal having pore underneath C-shaped portion of somatic kinety 1 (Fig.
106a, d, m; 356w-z). Cytopyge slit in line with excretory pore, extends in posterior half of
cell, becomes a fusiform opening when faecal mass with ellipsoidal crystals leaves cell.
Resting extrusomes attached almost perpendicularly to cortex and usually close to left
posterior margin of somatic kinetids in anterior half of cell and to left anterior margin in
posterior half of cell; fusiform, conspicuous because large compared to size of cell, namely,
4-5 x 0.7 urn, but do not form a distinct fringe because as sparse as cilia (Fig. 106a, f; 356k).
No mucocysts extruded after methyl green-pyronin application. Cortex about 1 urn thick and
bright, with distinct ribs along ciliary rows and ciliary pits (Fig. 106o). Mitochondria
underneath cortex, conspicuous because numerous, up to 8 urn long, and serpentine and
occasionally even branched (Fig. 106j; 356a, d). Cytoplasm colourless, contains colourless
food vacuoles 4-15 urn across and some fat inclusions 1-3 urn across. Movement without
peculiarities, that is, swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.

Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, except for slightly more closely spaced
postoral kineties. Dorsal and lateral ciliary rows bipolar. Preoral suture very short and
inconspicuous because formed by only two to three rows on each side, merges into elliptical,
barren anterior pole area. Kinety 1 (first row right of paroral) bipartited (Fig. 106d, m; 356c,
k, j, q-u, w-z; Table 85): anterior portion long and C-shaped, commences subapically with
some rather closely spaced monokinetids and extends with closely spaced dikinetids14 to
excretory pore along a furrow right of the oral apparatus; posterior portion short (one to four
kinetids) and straight, monokinetidal, commences slightly underneath and right of excretory
pore and abuts obliquely on cytopyge. Usually four monokinetidal postoral kineties: kinety 1
commences underneath left end of paroral membrane; kineties 2 and 3 commence underneath
scattered basal bodies (nassulid organelle 2?) left of nassulid organelle 3; and kinety 4
commences underneath and slightly left of the excretory pore (Fig. 106d, m; 356c, k, q, w).
Somatic cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, single except for 9-10 pairs in C-shaped anterior
portion of somatic kinety 1. Distances between kinetids rather large, except for C-shaped
portion of somatic kinety 1, where they are closely spaced. Silver carbonate preparations
reveal each somatic kinetid to be composed of (i) an rather irregular (possibly due to attached

C-shaped portion of somatic kinety 1 but, as in the -» Colpodidiidae, surround the excretory pore.

parasomal sac and/or alveolocyst and/or extrusome) granule bearing the cilium; (ii) a short
structure (kinetodesmal fibre?) extending obliquely anteriad at right side of basal body,
except for dikinetids in somatic kinety 1; and (iii) a short structure (transverse fibre?)
extending almost perpendicularly to kinety axis at left side of basal body (Fig. 106m; 356k, q,
r, t, u). No elongated caudal cilia.
Oral apparatus with subapical opening in anterior quarter of cell, composed of four distinct
components: pharyngeal basket, nassulid organelles, paroral membrane, and, at right, a
conspicuous, C-shaped kinety. Pharyngeal basket extends straight to dorsal side, where it
curves sharply posteriad, composed of about 12-15 fine, distinctly twisted rods lightly
impregnating with silver carbonate; distal end heavily impregnated with silver nitrate and of
unique structure, that is, with an anterior and posterior tooth-like process providing entrance
with a fish-snout like appearance (Fig. 106a, b, d, m, n; 356b, e, f, g, h, s, w-z). Nassulid
organelles in semicircular furrow along posterior margin of pharyngeal basket, without
distinct fibres; only organelle 3 clearly recognizable, slightly curved, consists of about 6-9
ciliary rows each composed of three basal bodies bearing about 6 urn long, mobile cilia;
organelle 1 likely between left end of paroral membrane and anterior end of first postoral
kinety, consists of two to three basal bodies only; organelle 2 possibly composed of scattered
basal bodies between organelles 1 and 3. Paroral membrane above pharyngeal basket, right
portion extends into furrow left of dikinetidal portion of kinety 1, distinctly curved, composed
of 11-14 dikinetids orientated perpendicularly to kinety axis and bearing about 6 urn long
cilia; left (proximal) basal body of dikinetids very likely barren because often faintly
impregnated, or not at all (Fig. 106a, m; 356c, k, q-z). C-shaped kinety represents anterior
portion of ciliary row 1, consists of some monokinetids anteriorly and closely spaced
dikinetids posteriorly; easily misinterpreted as paroral membrane because curved, long,
conspicuous, and close to the oral apparatus, seemingly forming a semicircle with the paroral
(Fig. 106a, m; 356b, j, k, s, t).
Silverline system as in Furgasonia blochmanni (FOISSNER 1989) and Parafurgasonia sorex
(FOISSNER & ADAM 1981), that is, narrowly meshed in somatic and oral cortex, forms two
similarly sized polygons between each two ciliary rows in anterior half of cell and 3-4
polygons each in posterior half of cell (Fig. 106k; 356m-p, v).
Observations on other populations: The Saudi Arabian specimens match those
from the type location in most features (Table 85). They have, however, a greater size range
(silver nitrate-impregnated specimens: 38-73 x 20-28 urn vs. 33-48 x 19-25 urn), a slightly
stouter shape (length:width ratio: 1.8:1 vs. 2:1; Table 85), and two size types of extrusomes (5
urn and 7 urn). The Namibian population was not studied in detail because of its apparent
similarity with the Costa Rican specimens (Fig. 356f, 1).
Occurrence and ecology: Woljkosia loeffleri was discovered in dry mud from rock-
pools in volcanic bedrock at the bank of Rio Corobici, Costa Rica. A second population was
found in slightly saline and acidic (pH 6.4) soil from a vegetable field near the village of Al-
Jubailah, about 20 km north of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The sample contained mainly weed
litter and the greyish upper (1 cm) soil layer. The ciliate community was highly diverse,
comprising about 80 species. Furthermore, W. loeffleri occurred in a mud sample taken from
rock-pools in the dolomite hills near the Halali Lodge at the south margin of the Etosha Pan,
Namibia (site 66). Based on these records, it is impossible to decide whether W. loeffleri
prefers limnetic or terrestrial habitats, but a world-wide distribution is likely.
462

Comparison with similar species: Wolfkosia loeffleri is easily distinguished from
other ftirgasoniids and the colpodidiids by the "circular" oral structures, the highly character-
istic distal end of the pharyngeal basket, and the obovoidal body shape. These features
distinguish it also from —» Apocolpodidium (Apocolpodidium) etoschense, which is otherwise
very similar. As concerns shape and size, it is also easily confused with Sathrophilus
muscorum, a very common soil and moss ciliate. The pharyngeal basket of Wolflcosia is not
only peculiar because of the fish-snout like distal end, but also because of its orientation, viz.,
it extends straight to dorsal side and then curves sharply posteriad. A similar pattern is shown
only by marine, microthoracid discotrichids (FOISSNER 1997a).

Order Colpodidiida nov. ordo
Diagnosis: Medium-sized (length 50-100 um) Nassulia JANKOWSKI, 1967 with distinct
dikinetidal paroral membrane, 3 nassulid (adoral) organelles within more or less distinct
buccal cavity, and 4 postoral ciliary rows. Oral basket extends anteriorly, where it curves
dorsally and posteriorly; composed of very fine fibres and thus inconspicuous. Nassulid
organelles 1 and 2 minute, that is, composed of only few dikinetids, organelle 3 conspicuous
and composed of several minute kineties each consisting of 3 cilia. Proter's paroral produces,
by transverse and longitudinal splitting, a new proter paroral, the opisthe paroral, proter's
postoral kinety 4, and dikinetidal anlagen for the nassulid organelles. Somatic kinety 1
oralized, that is, produces part of nassulid organelle 3, while the other part is generated by
paroral anlagen. Nasse kinetosomes distinct in dividers.
Type family: Colpodidiidae FOISSNER, 1995.
Classification and comparison with related orders: We discovered several
new colpodidiid nassulids in Namibia and soils globally. All are described here to firmly
establish the new order. Fortunately, we could even study the ontogenesis of the type species,
—> Colpodidium caudatum. This and a few observations on other species [Pedohymena
australiensis FOISSNER, 1995; —> Apocolpodidium (Apocolpodidium) etoschense] showed that
colpodidiids have a unique stomatogenic pattern, although it is mixokinetal as in other
members of the subclass (for review and terminology, see FOISSNER 1996c). Thus, we
separated them at ordinal level. As yet, the order is monotypic. However, the family consists
of three genera and four subgenera, of which —> Apocolpodidium and —> Pedohymena might
compose a second family. Such classification, however, should await more detailed data on
ontogenesis and ultrastructure.
As concerns the overall classification, the Colpodidiida very likely belong to the Nassulia
because their general organization and stomatogenesis are more similar to the Nassulia than
to any other ciliates. Furthermore, the silver preparations provide strong evidence for the
464

presence of alveolocysts, a main apomorphy of the nassulids (EISLER & BARDELE 1983).
The classic nassulid genera, such as —» Nassula, —» Furgasonia, Chilodontopsis, and
Microthorax, have been raised to ordinal rank, based, however, mainly on morphostatic
features (for review, see DEROUX 1994). In contrast, we define the new nassuline order by a
combination of morphostatic and ontogenetic features, emphasizing the latter. —» Colpo-
didium has a mixokinetal stomatogenesis, that is, the opisthe oral structures are produced by
parental oral and somatic ciliature. The mixokinetal mode is typical for nassulids (FoiSSNER
1996c), to which Colpodidium accordingly belongs. Although the ontogenesis of Colpo-
didium shows some similarities with that of Furgasonia (order Parahymenostomatida) and
Pseudomicrothorax/Leptopharynx (order Microthoracida), it is so different that relationships
can hardly be recognised. At best, it can be interpreted as a mixture of parahymenostomatid
and microthoracid features. In both Colpodidium and Furgasonia the paroral plays a leading
role in that it splits transversely and longitudinally (EISLER & BARDELE 1986; Fig. 357m-u).
The posterior fragment generates, as in —» Colpodidium, the opisthe's paroral, while the split
outer part of the paroral becomes a new somatic kinety 1, which is, like the origin of the
nassulid organelles, completely different from Colpodidium. Colpodidium and Pseudomicro-
thorax/Leptopharynx are similar in that somatic kinety 1 contributes to the nassulid organelles
and distinct nasse kinetosomes occur (NJINE 1979a, PECK 1974). The origin and role of the
paroral, in contrast, is totally different.
The leading role of the parental oral structures in the ontogenesis of the Colpodidiidae is
highly reminiscent of hymenostome scuticociliates (for review, see FOISSNER 1996c). This
might indicate a closer relationship between nassulid and oligohymenophorean ciliates than
presently shown by gene sequence data (SCHLEGEL & EiSLER 1996).
Members of the orders Colpodidiida, Nassulida, and Parahymenostomatida may look very
similar at first glance. There is, however, a simple feature distinguishing the Colpodidiida
from the Nassulida and Parahymenostomatida (e.g. -» Wolfkosia, —> Furgasonia), namely the
pharyngeal basket, which is directed anteriorly and inconspicuous in the former and usually
conspicuous in the latter, where it is directed posteriorly and composed of thick, stiff rods.
Thus, this is a main morphological feature of the new order; interestingly, such a basket
pattern is also found in certain species of the order Microthoracida, where it probably evolved
convergently. The inconspicuousness of the colpodidiid pharyngeal basket, even after
protargol impregnation, strongly indicates a special ultrastructure; in some species, e.g., —>
Colpodidium trichocystiferum, —> C. microstoma, —> Apocolpodidium (Apocolpodidium)
etoschense, and —> A. macrostoma, basket structures are not recognizable at all. On the other
hand, the basket may be inconspicuous also in other nassulids, especially in some Para-
hymenostomatida, e.g., Parafurgasonia protectissima and P. terricola, as described by
FoiSSNER (1999b).
A further important feature is the buccal cavity. All other Nassulia, except for most micro-
thoracids, lack a distinct buccal cavity, while that of the Colpodidiida is usually conspicuous
and contains the adoral ciliature, much like the Parahymenostomatida. In the Nassulida, the
adoral ciliature extends left, splitting some or many somatic ciliary rows. Finally, the known
Colpodidiida have only one distinct nassulid organelle because the organelles 1 and 2 are
minute and thus easily overlooked (FoiSSNER 1995, MIRABDULLAYEV 1986, WILBERT 1982).
This is a main difference to the Parahymenostomatida, which either have three conspicuous
nassulid organelles of same size (—> Furgasonia) or only a single nassulid organelle (->
465

Parafurgasonia, and possibly also -» Wolfkosia) or none at all (—» Urlielld). According to its
ontogenesis, the nassulid organelle 3 consists, like the organelles of —> Furgasonia and
Pseudomicrothorax, of more or less numerous ciliary rows with three basal bodies each,.
while the nassulid organelles in the order Nassulida are composed of three ciliary rows with
more or less numerous basal bodies each (EISLER 1986, 1988, 1989). As concerns the paroral
membrane, the dikinetidal organization is usually much more distinct in the Colpodidiidae
than in the Nassulidae.
We also included "four postoral ciliary rows" in the diagnosis because all known species of
the order have this number. In contrast, the Nassulida have many kineties under the oral
opening and nassulid frange, and the Parahymenostomatida have few (e.g. -»• Para-
furgasonia) or many (—> Furgasonia) postoral ciliary rows.
Family Colpodidiidae FOISSNER, 1995
Improved diagnosis: With characteristics of order.
Type genus (original designation): Colpodidium WILBERT, 1982.
Remarks: The family greatly enlarged since 1982, when it consisted of a single genus and
species only. Now nine species distributed over three genera (-> Colpodidium WILBERT,
1982; -»• Pedohymena FOISSNER, 1995; —> Apocolpodidium nov. gen.) and four subgenera (—>
Colpodidium WILBERT, 1982 stat. nov.; —> Pseudocolpodidium nov. subgen.; —» Apocolpo-
didium nov. subgen., —» Phagoon nov. subgen.) are known. All, except for C. viride
(MIRABDULLAYEV, 1986) JANKOWSKI, 1992, occur in terrestrial habitats. -» Pedohymena and
-> Colpodidium need improved diagnoses according to the emended family characterization
provided above.
Pedohymena FOISSNER, 1995 (Fig. 283-285)
Improved diagnosis: Colpodidiidae FOISSNER, 1995 with broadly conical buccal
cavity directed dorsally. Paroral membrane long and loop-shaped. Nassulid organelle 3
orientated obliquely to main body axis. Postoral kineties basically monokinetidal.
Type species (original designation): Pedohymena australiensis FOISSNER, 1995 (nom.
corr. for P. australiense FOISSNER, 1995).
Colpodidium WILBERT, 1982
Improved diagnosis: Colpodidiidae FOISSNER, 1995 with horn-shaped or pocket-
shaped buccal cavity directed anteriorly or to right side. Paroral membrane slightly to
distinctly curved. Nassulid organelle 3 orientated obliquely or perpendicularly to main body
466

axis. At least postoral kinety 2, which commences in buccal cavity, possesses some dikinetids
anteriorly.
Type species (by monotypy): Colpodidium caudatum WILBERT, 1982.
Remarks: In addition to the new genus -» Apocolpodidium, described below, we
discovered four other new Colpodidium species, of which one {Colpodidium bradburyarum)
looks rather different due to the shape and orientation of the buccal cavity. However, the
infraciliature is very similar to that of Colpodidium. Thus, we separate this new species from
Colpodidium not at genus but at subgenus level. Accordingly, Colpodidium is split into two
subgenera: Colpodidium WiLBERT, 1982 stat. nov. and Pseudocolpodidium nov. subgen.
Subgenus Colpodidium WILBERT, 1982 nov. stat.
Diagnosis: Buccal cavity horn-shaped and directed anteriorly. Paroral membrane slightly
curved. Nassulid organelle 3 orientated obliquely to main body axis. Postoral kineties 2 and 3
with several dikinetids anteriorly.
Remarks: This subgenus contains -» Colpodidium (Colpodidium) caudatum WILBERT,
1982; Colpodidium (Colpodidium) viride (MlRABDULLAYEV, 1986) JANKOWSKJ, 1992 [nom.
corr. for Colpodidium viridis (MlRABDULLAEV, 1986) JANKOWSKJ, 1992]; -» Colpodidium
(Colpodidium) horribile nov. spec; -» Colpodidium (Colpodidium) trichocystiferum nov.
spec; and —» Colpodidium (Colpodidium) microstoma nov. spec.
Colpodidium {Colpodidium) caudatum WILBERT, 1982 nov. stat. (Fig. 357h-y,
358a-d; Table 86)
Colpodidium caudatum is rather frequent in Namibian soils. We could study ontogenesis in a
population grown on Eau de Volvic and crushed wheat grains to stimulate growth of the
indigenous bacteria and flagellate protist community, which served as food.
Colpodidium caudatum has been redescribed in great detail by FOISSNER (1995), including
some ontogenetie-stages which showed, for the first time, the three-nassulid organelles; other
details, however, were misinterpreted: somatic kinety 1 in FoiSSNER's micrograph 57 is the
outer, split part of the parental paroral membrane, and the "developing pharyngeal basket" in
figure 56, which was reproduced side-inverted, is the new excretory pore.
As the species is well-known, we shall provide only a brief description of the Namibian
population, emphasizing ontogenetically important structures. Further details are shown in the
figures and table 86; see also description of Chinese population, below. In vivo, the Namibian
Colpodidium caudatum is a 40-55 x 15-25 um-sized, slightly reniform ciliate with a horn-
shaped vestibulum in mid-body. It usually has 21 ciliary rows, which form a distinct preoral
suture. The ciliary rows are monokinetidal, except for a few dikinetids in the postoral portion
of kinety 1, a few dikinetids around the excretory pore, and some dikinetids at the anterior
467

end of postoral kineties 2 and 3 (Fig. 357a-g and FOISSNER 1995). The excretory pore of the
contractile vacuole is slightly underneath the right end of the paroral. The oral apparatus
consists of a slightly curved, dikinetidal paroral membrane (with only one basal body
ciliated!) and three nassulid organelles. Organelle 1 consists of a single dikinetid between left
end of paroral and anterior end of postoral kinety 1. Organelle 2 consists of one or two
dikinetids at anterior end of postoral kinety 2. Organelle 3, which is rather conspicuous and
extends on the dorsal vestibular wall, consists of 13 short ciliary rows each composed of three
cilia.

Ontogenesis (Fig. 357h-y, 358a-d): The ontogenesis of C. caudatum could be followed in
non-permanent silver carbonate preparations15. Accordingly, the process is not documented by
line drawings but by 23 excellent micrographs, which are arranged and described in the figure
explanations in such a way that the successive stages can be easily followed. Thus, the
description concentrates on the key events, that is, how the main structures behave and
originate during ontogenesis.
Nassulid organelles: The opisthe nassulid organelles have an unusual and complex
origin (Fig. 357a-r). Organelle 3, the largest one, is a composite of anlagen formed by
somatic kinety 1 and the two dikinetids above and left of the excretory pore. This is not only
clear from the sequence of events shown in figures 357m-q, but also from the structure of the
completed organelle (Fig. 357q), whose 15-17 ciliary rows are obtained only if the three
anlagen are united. Furthermore, only kinety 1 produces such an anläge, showing that it is not
an ordinary somatic kinety. As the dikinetids around the excretory pore are generated by the
15 All trials to get usable protargol preparations failed. Silver nitrate preparations were easily obtained, but too
crude for following the fine ontogenetic processes. However, slides with many dividers have been deposited.
468

paroral, organelle 3 is a composite of somatic and oral ciliature. The organelles 1 and 2, each
consisting of only few dikinetids, are very likely produced by a split part of the proter paroral.
However, we cannot entirely exclude, due to the close spatial relationships, that they originate
from the dikinetid above the excretory pore. Anyway, in both cases the nassulid organelles 1
and 2 originate from the paroral because the proliferating dikinetids are of paroral origin, that
is, are separated from the new paroral in late dividers (Fig. 357v-y).
Paroral membrane: The prater's paroral has a leading role in stomatogenesis because it
produces, by transverse and longitudinal splitting, a new proter paroral, the opisthe paroral,
the prater's postoral kinety 4, a dikinetidal anläge for nassulid organelle 3 and, possibly, also
for organelles 1 and 2 (see above). The paroral separates its posterior portion very early and
then splits longitudinally (Fig. 357 1-p). The posterior portion migrates rearwards and
produces the opisthe paroral and, very likely, also nassulid organelles 1 and 2 (Fig. 357p-r).
The inner split part of the prater's paroral is reorganized and becomes the prater's new
paroral, which separates two dikinetids at the posterior end; these dikinetids migrate to the
excretory pore (Fig. 357u-y, 358a, b), where they become nassulid anlagen in early dividers
(Fig. 357n-l). The outer split part (marked by PM*) of the prater's paroral elongates and
produces the prater's postoral kinety 4, which is lacking because the opisthe gets the entire
parental postoral 4 (Fig. 357 1-r); later, it is resorbed. Accordingly, there is no shift of kineties
like, for instance, in Nassula and Furgasonia (EiSLER & BARDELE 1986).
Somatic kineties (except kinety 1 and postoral kineties treated below): The somatic
kineties divide as in other ordinary ciliates, that is, new basal bodies for the filial products are
produced intrakinetally, forming typical triplets (Fig. 357r, s, v-y).
Somatic kinety 1: Somatic kinety 1 plays a key role in ontogenesis by producing part
of nassulid organelle 3 (Fig. 357g-q). Accordingly, it is an "oralized somatic kinety" in the
sense of FOISSNER & FOISSNER (1988). The lost basal bodies are replaced by intrakinetal
proliferation, as in ordinary somatic kineties.
Postoral kineties: Postoral kineties 1-3 divide like ordinary somatic kineties. How-
ever, basal body proliferation commences much earlier in kinety 1 than in the other ciliary
rows (Fig. 357i, j), and the anterior, dikinetidal portion of postoral kinety 2 is reorganized,
that is, resorbed and rebuilt (Fig. 357t-v). Prater's postoral kinety 4 is produced by the outer
split part of the paroral (Fig. 357t-x), while the opisthe obtains the parental postoral 4.
Nuclear apparatus: The nuclear apparatus divides as in other ordinary ciliates. It is in
the posterior end of the cell in interphase specimens and migrates to body centre before
division commences (Fig. 357m, p^ r, v-y).
Reorganization: The parental oral structures are partially or fully reorganized, espe-
cially the paroral membrane and the "nasse kinetosomes". The nasse kinetosomes (and/or the
distal end of the oral basket) behave very strangely: first they become very distinct in early
dividers (Fig. 357j, m-o), then they disappear for a short period (Fig. 357r-v) and become
very distinct again in late dividers producing a semicircular array of granules (Fig. 357w-y)
and, finally, they become pygnotic (Fig. 358a-d). Certainly, these processes are very difficult
to analyze because the structures are so small. Thus, misinterpretations are possible. But the
basic observation that Colpodidium possesses nasse kinetosomes is undoubtedly correct (Fig.
357w-y). The nassulid organelles are also partially reorganized, as indicated by the following
observation: in morphostatic specimens, organelle 3 is composed of 12-14 short kineties
469

(Table 86), while both the proter and opisthe organelle 3 consist of 15-17 rows in middle and
late dividers (Fig. 357q, t, v, w, 358a, c, d).
Post-divider changes: Early post-dividers have more distinct "nasse kinetosomes"
(cp. Fig. 358a-d with Fig. 357f) and some kineties of nassulid organelle 3 are resorbed (see
above). Possibly, there are also some changes in the anterior portion of somatic kinety 1
which appears more conspicuous in late dividers and post-dividers than in morphostatic cells
(Fig. 357d, e, g, 358a-d). Cell shaping also occurs mainly in post-dividers because newly
divided cells are ellipsoidal and have a rather flat buccal cavity.
Colpodidium (Colpodidium) caudatum WlLBERT, 1982 - Chinese population
(Fig. 107a-g; 359a-j; Tables 87, 88)
Description: Size 70-90 x 25—40 urn, usually 80 x 30 urn in vivo. Shape fairly constant
and conspicuous because elongate fusiform to fusiform, anterior end considerably and
frequently more tapered than posterior, widest at level of oral apparatus, dorsal side moder-
ately convex, ventral more or less flattened with a triangular, shallow preoral groove; cross
section circular (Fig. 107a, g; 359a-c; Table 87). Macronucleus underneath mid-body,
broadly ellipsoidal to spherical, about 13 urn across in vivo, with reticular nucleolus.
Micronucleus globular, difficult to recognize because usually in shallow indentation of
macronucleus. Contractile vacuole subequatorial underneath buccal cavity, surrounded by
contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pore in line with paroral membrane under-
neath right margin of buccal entrance, distinct even in vivo. Cytopyge slit underneath
excretory pore, extends in posterior body end (Fig. 107d; 359h, i). No extrusomes. Cortex
thinner (only 0.5-0.7 urn) and more flexible than in other populations and congeners,
furrowed by ciliary rows, especially in anterior body half (Fig. 359a, c). Mitochondria
underneath cortex, rod-shaped or reniform, occasionally irregular, numerous and thus
conspicuous although only 1.5-3 urn long (Fig. 107f; 359b, d). Cytoplasm colourless and
bright, contains some fat globules 1-2 urn across. Food vacuoles with remnants of bacilli,
mainly spores, 2>-A urn across during acidic phase, up to 15 urn in the alkaline state, where
the condensed content becomes fluffy. Swims rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Ciliary rows equidistantly arranged, those of left and dorsal side sinistrally twisted, gradually
shortened from anterior body end to oral apparatus, terminate subapically and subterminally,
forming barren pole areas. Kinety spiralling mainly caused by about ten left lateral and dorsal
kineties, which extend at angles of about 45° across preoral ventral surface and abut on about
six ventral and right lateral ciliary rows. Thus, a long, sigmoidal, groove-like depressed
preoral suture is formed with a small, triangular blank area above the paroral membrane (Fig.
107b, c; 359i, j; Table 87). Kinety 1 (first right of paroral) sigmoidally curved, commences
pre-equatorially with closely spaced monokinetids, extends along oral apparatus with closely
spaced dikinetids restricted to the area between paroral and excretory pore, and usually
terminates near posterior quarter of cell with a rather short tail (4-6 kinetids) of ordinarily
spaced monokinetids. Four postoral kineties (Fig. 107b, d, e; 359e, h, i): kinety 1 at
left margin of buccal cavity, slightly curved, usually commences underneath minute
nassulid organelle 1, monokinetidal throughout; kinety 2 performs sharp right bend, causing

Anterior end of paroral on average 40% back from anterior body end, buccal cavity thus in
mid-body. Buccal opening elliptical and about 5 urn long; buccal cavity horn-shaped and
approximately 10 urn deep, contains nassulid organelle 3 and anterior portion of postoral
kinety 2. Nassulid organelles without distinct fibres, details difficult to recognize due to their
small size (Fig. 107b, d, e; 359e, g-i): organelle 1 between left end of paroral and anterior end
of postoral kinety 1, minute because consisting of only two granules, often lighter impreg-
nated than paroral and somatic kinetids; organelle 2 probably at proximal end of postoral
kinety 2, where a slightly separated dikinetid occurs; organelle 3 extends on dorsal wall of
buccal cavity to cytostome, orientated obliquely to main body axis, slightly concave,
composed of about 19-22 ciliary rows with three basal bodies each. Paroral membrane
extends in flat bow along right and upper margin of buccal entrance; conspicuous because
consisting of 14-19 dikinetids orientated perpendicularly to kinety axis, distances between
dikinetids increase slightly from left to right (Fig. 107b, d, e, g; 359a, e-i; Table 87).
Pharyngeal basket recognizable neither in vivo nor silver preparations.
Silverline system as in Kenyan population (FOISSNER 1995), that is, irregularly meshed in
somatic and oral cortex.
Occurrence and ecology: WILBERT (1982) discovered C. caudatum in savannah soil
from Afghanistan. Later, FOISSNER (1995, 1998a) recorded it from soils world-wide. The
Chinese population is from soil (mud) of a river overflow in Beijing. Colpodidium caudatum
is a rare species distinctly more frequent in Gondwanan than Laurasian areas.
Comparison of populations: The Chinese specimens look very different, especially
when compared with the Namibian site (3) population (cp. figures 107a-g and 359a-j with
figures 357a-g), because they are large, conspicuously fusiform, and have strongly spiralling
ciliary rows. However, a separation at subspecies level does not seem justified at the present
state of knowledge because there are transitions in all features (Table 88), that is,
Colpodidium caudatum shows a strong interpopulation and intraspecific variability. On the
other hand, the differences of the Chinese population are considerable, especially in body
shape and size as well as in the strongly spiral kinety course, indicating that C. caudatum
might be a complex of sibling species. The Benin population described by DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1996) differs from the other populations mainly in the longer paroral
membrane and in that kinety 1 commences more anteriorly; thus, it is very similar to -» C.
horribile (see "comparison with related species" by this species).

Colpodidium (Colpodidium) horribile nov. spec. (Fig. 108a-t, 109a-g; 275-
278, 360a-s; Table 89)
Diagnosis: Size about 60 x 30 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. Macronucleus in middle third of
cell. Trichocysts pin-shaped, highly refractive. On average 25 somatic ciliary rows and
paroral dikinetids. Buccal opening rather large and slightly underneath mid-body. Nassulid
organelle 3 composed of about 16 ciliary rows.
Type location: Highly saline soil from littoral of Lake Nakuru, Kenya, East Africa,
00°N 37°E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective horribile (horrible) refers to the highly characteristic
trichocysts.
Description: Size 55-75 x 25-40 urn in vivo. Shape fairly constant, lateral view
ellipsoidal to slightly ovoidal with flat ventral and more or less distinctly vaulted dorsal side;
length:width ratio 1.7-2.1:1, usually 1.9:1 in protargol preparations, cells thus appear rather
broad, especially if compared with most -> C. caudatum populations (2.5:1). Laterally
slightly flattened, ventral and dorsal view elongate ellipsoidal to ovoidal (Fig. 108a, f, m;
360a-d; Table 89). Macronucleus usually in middle third of cell, about 13 ^m across in vivo,
474

with reticular nucleolus. Micronucleus usually attached to macronucleus, globular to
ellipsoidal, difficult to recognize in vivo because very hyaline (blister-like). Contractile
vacuole subequatorial, underneath buccal cavity, with short excretory canal having pore in
line with paroral membrane underneath right margin of buccal entrance. Cytopyge slit close
underneath excretory pore, extends in posterior quarter of cell; faecal mass globular and
mucilaginous, contains some minute refractive granules. Resting trichocysts scattered in
cytoplasm and attached almost perpendicularly to cortex close to left side of ciliary rows,
moderately numerous forming indistinct fringe; conspicuous, although having a size of only 4
x 1 urn, because highly refractive appearing as about 1 um-sized, brilliant granules in surface
view (Fig. 108a, n; 360b, c, f, j). Shape also peculiar and as shown in figures 108r, s, that is,
pin-like with a dome-shaped head and a cuneate, slightly inflated shaft. Exploded trichocysts
in vivo with highly refractive, conical tip and hyaline, 25-30 urn long shaft narrowing
posteriorly (Fig. 108t; 360e, f, h). Trichocysts do not impregnate with protargol, but tip stains,
occasionally, intensely with silver carbonate, producing a peculiar, spotted appearance of
impregnated cells; tips appear hat-like after silver carbonate impregnation and in vivo, if
observed with phase contrast, that is, have a conical centre surrounded by a minute collar
(Fig. 108q; 360i, k, m, n). Under cover glass pressure and possible also other, as yet unspeci-
fied conditions, the trichocysts partially explode internally showing a highly remarkable
behaviour reminiscent of cnidocysts: they quickly and irregularly jump and swirl twice at
irregular intervals, becoming ellipsoidal and appearing partially uncoiled, showing the highly
refractive tip (Fig. 108g-l). Cortex distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows, thinner than in -»
Nassula spp., but slightly notched by the extrusomes; mitochondria underneath cortex,
conspicuous because numerous and 2-3 x 0.5 urn in size, rod-shaped to dumb-bell-shaped
(Fig. 108n-p; 360a, f, g, h). Cytoplasm colourless, contains many bright fat globules about 1
urn across and 4-10 um-sized food vacuoles with bacterial remnants, especially spores.
Movement without peculiarities.
Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, except for more widely spaced postoral
kineties; dorsal kineties bipolar, those on ventral side form comparatively large, triangular,
blank area above oral apparatus and long preoral suture in midline because left side kineties
abut obliquely on right side kineties, which gradually shorten from anterior end of cell to oral
apparatus (Fig. 109a, c, g; 275-278, 360p; Table 89). Kinety 1 (first right of paroral)
commences pre-equatorially with closely spaced monokinetids, extends along oral apparatus
with rather widely spaced dikinetids, and ends terminally or subterminally with a tail of
widely spaced monokinetids. Four postoral kineties (Fig. 109a, b, d, e, g; 275-278, 360m-s):
kinety 1 commences left of minute nassulid organelle 1, monokinetidal throughout; kinety 2
commences in proximal portioa of buccal cavity, dikinetidal in anterior hal£ monokinetidal in
posterior; kinety 3 commences at distal end of nassulid organelle 3, dikinetidal anteriorly,
monokinetidal posteriorly; kinety 4 commences at level of excretory pore of contractile
vacuole, monokinetidal throughout.
Somatic cilia about 10-11 (im long and rather stiff in vivo, single, except for four to ten
dikinetids in kinety 1 at level of oral apparatus, two to three dikinetids around excretory pore,
ten to thirteen dikinetids in anterior portion of postoral kinety 2, and one to three dikinetids at
anterior end of postoral kinety 3. Cilia very closely spaced in anterior region of somatic
kinety 1 and postoral kineties 1-3; distances between cilia increase from anterior to posterior,
ciliature thus loosened in rear pole area. Silver carbonate preparations reveal each somatic
kinetid to be composed of (i) an irregular (possibly due to attached parasomal sac and/or

alveolocyst and/or trichocyst) granule bearing the cilium; (ii) a short structure (kinetodesmal
fibre?) extending obliquely anteriad at right side of basal body, except for anterior basal body
of dikinetids, where it is lacking, and anterior portion of postoral kineties 2 and 3, where it is
very long and extends almost perpendicularly to kinety axis; and (iii) a short structure
(transverse fibre?), slightly elongated in preoral portion of somatic kineties 1-3 and lacking in
the anterior basal body of the postoral dikinetids, extending almost perpendicularly to kinety
axis at left side of basal body (Fig. 109g; 275-278, 360p, s).
Summit of paroral on average 50% back from anterior body end, about 6-8 urn wide buccal
opening thus slightly underneath mid-body. Buccal cavity conspicuous, horn-shaped, contains
nassulid organelles 2 and 3 and anterior portion of postoral kinety 2 (Fig. 108a-e, m; 275-
278, 360a-d; Table 89). Nassulid organelles without distinct fibres, details difficult to
recognize due to their small size (Fig. 108a, b, d, e, g; 275-278, 360o, r, s). Nassulid
organelle 1 between left end of paroral and anterior end of postoral kinety 1, minute because
consisting of only two granules, lighter impregnated than paroral and somatic kinetids.
Nassulid organelle 2 probably at proximal end of postoral kinety 2, where a few faintly
impregnated and thus hardly recognizable basal bodies occur. Nassulid organelle 3 extends on
dorsal wall of buccal cavity to cytostome, orientated obliquely to main cell axis, slightly
concave, composed of 13-19 ciliary rows with three basal bodies each. Paroral membrane
conspicuous, even in vivo, because composed of closely spaced cilia increasing in length
from 3-4 urn at right end to 12 urn at left, extends in flat bow along right and upper margin of
buccal opening; composed of 19-33 dikinetids orientated perpendicularly to kinety axis and
having only one basal body ciliated, distances between dikinetids increase slightly from left to
right (Fig. 109b, e; 275-278, 360n, r). Pharyngeal basket large but hardly recognizable in vivo
and even protargol preparations because composed of about 18 very thin rods; extends as a
wide funnel, which sometimes appears as a bright stripe in live specimens, from proximal
vertex of buccal cavity to near anterior end of cell, where it curves dorsally (Fig. 109a, b).
Silverline system as in -> C. caudatum (FoiSSNER 1995), that is, irregularly meshed in
somatic and oral cortex, producing about four minute polygons between each two ciliary
rows; meshes partially filled with argyrophilic substance in suboptimal preparations (Fig.
109f; 360 1).
The Chinese specimens match those from the type population in all main morphometrics
(Table 89). They show, however, a much greater shape variability (Fig. 108b-e).
Occurrence and ecology: Colpodidium horribile was discovered in a sample
containing grass roots and grey, highly saline mineral soil from the littoral of Lake Nakuru,
one of the famous soda lakes in Kenya, East Africa. A second population was found in a
sample containing litter and loamy, dark-brown soil (pH 6.7) from the bottom of a moist
overflow 1 km from a river in Beijing, China (40°N 117°E). Furthermore, C. horribile
occurred in a sample from the Etosha Pan region (site 54), which contained highly saline soil
(pH 8) mixed with grass roots. Abundant at all sites. Likely, C. horribile is a euryhaline
cosmopolitan.
Comparison with related species: -> Colpodidium caudatum WiLBERT, 1982
lacks trichocysts, which we consider as species character, and has a kinety 1 commencing
more anteriorly (about 20% vs. 40% back from anterior body end) as well as slightly fewer
somatic ciliary rows (16-23 vs. 23-26) and paroral dikinetids (12-19 vs. 19-33). In vivo, C.
horribile and -» C. caudatum can be rather reliably distinguished not only by the trichocysts
478

but also by the lengthrwidth ratio (1.9:1 vs. 2.5:1) and the location of the macronucleus (in
middle vs. posterior third). DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) redescribed -> C.
caudatum from Benin, Africa. However, their specimens differ from those studied by
WILBERT (1982) and FOISSNER (1995), especially in the number of paroral dikinetids (about

25-30 vs. 12-14); thus, DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) supposed that it is a new
species. In fact, the Benin population matches C. horribile in the long paroral membrane but
differs by the lack of trichocysts, a slightly smaller size (silver nitrate-impregnated speci-
mens: 20-58 x 10-20 jxm), and fewer ciliary rows (12-14). While body size and number of
ciliary rows are rather weak features, the lack of trichocysts is much more important.
However, DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) apparently did not study live specimens
and may thus have overlooked extrusomes. Colpodidium viride (MiRABDULLAYEV, 1986)
JANKOWSKI, 1992 has symbiotic green algae, lacks trichocysts, and has a hook-shaped
nassulid organelle.
The pin-shaped extrusomes of C. horribile are highly remarkable because all other nassulids
have fusiform extrusomes or none at all. To the best of our knowledge, only Pseudourostyla
cristata, a hypotrichous ciliate, has similarly-shaped extrusomes (OBERSCHMIDLEITNER &
AESCHT 1996, SUGANUMA 1973).
Colpodidium (Colpodidium) trichocystiferum nov. spec. (Fig. 110a—1; 271—
274, 361a-m; Table 90)
Diagnosis: Size about 50 x 25 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. Macronucleus in middle third of
cell. Trichocysts fusiform. On average 18 somatic ciliary rows and 17 paroral dikinetids.
Buccal opening rather large and in mid-body. Nassulid organelle 3 composed of about 10
ciliary rows.
Type location: Saline inland soil from Zicksee region, Burgenland, Austria, 47°50'N
16°50'E.
Etymology: Composite of trichocyst and ferum (Latin suffix; bearing), referring to the
fusiform extrusomes.
Description: Size 40-60 x 20-30 urn in vivo. Shape rather variable, ellipsoidal to
slightly ovoidal or cylindroidal with flat to slightly concave ventral and usually conspicuously
vaulted dorsal side, laterally rather distinctly flattened (lost in preparations; Table 90);
length:width ratio 1.7-2.2:1, usually 1.9-2:1 in vivo and protargol preparations, cells thus
appear rather broad, especially if compared with most —» C. caudatum populations (2.5:1;
Fig. 110a, k; 361a, b, d). Macronucleus in middle third of cell on average, rarely in anterior or
posterior third, about 10 urn across in vivo and with reticular nucleolus. Micronucleus
globular, difficult to recognize because usually in shallow indentation of macronucleus and
faintly impregnated with protargol. Contractile vacuole subequatorial underneath buccal
cavity; excretory pore in line with paroral membrane underneath right margin of buccal
entrance. Cytopyge slit close underneath excretory pore, extends in posterior third of cell,
becomes a large, fusiform opening during defecation (Fig. 110k). Resting trichocysts
scattered in cytoplasm and attached almost perpendicularly to cortex close to posterior or left
posterior margin of somatic kinetids in anterior half of cell and to left anterior margin of
kinetids in posterior half of cell, form indistinct fringe, fusiform, about 3-4 x 0.4 urn in size
(Fig. 110a, g; 36Id, e, g, i, j). Exploded trichocysts about 6 urn long, composed of a short,
refractive anterior rod attached to a minute globule and a comparatively large, hyaline, obclavate

posterior portion; degenerate to irregular blisters within a few minutes (Fig. 11 Oh, i). Cortex
distinctly punctated by ciliary pits, thinner than in —» Nassula spp.; mitochondria underneath
cortex, conspicuous because numerous and up to 5 x 1 urn in size, rod-shaped or more or less
distinctly curved. Cytoplasm colourless, contains 5-10 um-sized food vacuoles with bacterial
remnants, especially spores (Fig. 361m). Swims rather rapidly.
Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged; dorsal kineties bipolar, those on ventral
side form a preoral suture, which is, however, indistinct and confined to the anterior body
fifth due to the low number of ciliary rows and the comparatively large, triangular, blank
preoral area (Fig. HOe, f; 271-274, 361f, i, k). Kinety 1 (first right of paroral) commences
subapically with rather closely spaced monokinetids, extends along oral apparatus with rather
closely spaced dikinetids, and terminates near posterior body end with a tail of widely spaced
monokinetids. Four postoral kineties: kinety 1 commences underneath nassulid organelle 1,
monokinetidal throughout; kinety 2 commences in proximal portion of buccal cavity,
dikinetidal in anterior half, monokinetidal in posterior; kinety 3 commences at distal end of
nassulid organelle 3, dikinetidal anteriorly, monokinetidal posteriorly; kinety 4 commences at
level of excretory pore of contractile vacuole, monokinetidal throughout (Fig. 110b-f; 271—
274, 361c, f, i; Table 90).
Somatic cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, single except for four to six dikinetids in kinety 1 at
level of oral apparatus, usually two dikinetids around excretory pore, six to seven dikinetids
in anterior portion of postoral kinety 2, and two to four dikinetids at anterior end of postoral
kinety 3. Cilia closely spaced in anterior region of somatic kinety 1 and postoral kineties 1-3;
distances between cilia increase from anterior to posterior, ciliature thus loosened in rear pole
area. Fibrillar (?) associates of somatic kinetids as described in —» C. horribile and shown in
figure 11 Of. Special features are: (i) kinetodesmal fibres not elongated in anterior portion of
postoral kinety 3, and slightly elongated only in anterior portion of postoral kinety 2; (ii)
transverse fibres not elongated in preoral portion of kineties 1-3; (iii) transverse fibre
probably lacking in anterior, possibly unciliated basal body of dikinetids, at least in kinety 1.
Summit of paroral on average 40% back from anterior body end, about 6-8 urn wide buccal
entrance thus near mid-body. Buccal cavity conspicuous, horn-shaped, contains nassulid
organelle 3 and anterior portion of postoral kinety 2 (Fig. 110a, c, k; 271-274, 361a-d, k, 1;
Table 90). Nassulid organelles without distinct fibres, details difficult to recognize due to
their small size (Fig. 110c, e, f; 361i). Nassulid organelle 1 between left end of paroral and
anterior end of postoral kinety 1, minute because consisting of only two granules lighter
impregnated than paroral and somatic kinetids. Nassulid organelle 2 probably left of proximal
end of postoral kinety 2, where a few faintly impregnated and thus hardly recognizable basal
bodies occur. Nassulid organelle 3 extends on dorsal wall of buccal cavity to cytostome,
orientated obliquely to main cell axis, slightly concave, composed of 9-11 ciliary rows with
three basal bodies each. Paroral membrane conspicuous, even in vivo, because composed of
closely spaced, about 10 urn long cilia, extends in flat bow along right and upper margin of
buccal entrance; composed of 15-19 dikinetids orientated perpendicularly to kinety axis,
distances between dikinetids increase slightly from left to right (Fig. 110a, c, e, f; 271-274,
361c, d, i). Pharyngeal basket recognizable neither in vivo nor in silver preparations.
Silverline system as in C. caudatum (FoiSSNER 1995), that is, irregularly meshed in somatic
and oral cortex, producing 3—4 minute polygons between each two ciliary rows (Fig. HOj;
361f,h).

Occurrence and ecology: Colpodidium trichocystiferum was discovered in saline
soil (pH 8.1) from the Zicksee region in Austria, that is, between the Neusiedlersee and the
Hungarian borderline. Later, we found it at Namibian site (49), that is, in mud and soil from
track puddles. According to these records, C. trichocystiferum is a euryhaline cosmopolitan
preferring ephemeral habitats.
Comparison with related species: Within the genus Colpodidium, only —> C.
horribile has extrusomes, which, however, differ distinctly from those of C. trichocystiferum
in shape (pin-like vs. fusiform) and structure (trichocyst-like vs. toxicyst-like). Furthermore,
C. trichocystiferum is considerably smaller than C. horribile (protargol-impregnated
specimens: 35-50 x 18-26 um vs. 50-63 x 24-34 urn) and has fewer ciliary rows (17-18 vs.
23-26), kinetids in a dorsal ciliary row (12-14 vs. 19-28), paroral dikinetids (15-19 vs. 19-
33), dikinetids in the second postoral (6-7 vs. 10-13), and ciliary rows in the large nassulid
organelle (9-11 vs. 13-19). -» Colpodidium caudatum differs from C. trichocystiferum not
only by the lack of extrusomes (FOISSNER 1995, WILBERT 1982), but also in size (protargol-
483

impregnated specimens: 49-64 x 16-26 jim vs. 35-50 x 18-26 urn), number of basal bodies
in a dorsal ciliary row (23-32 vs. 12-14), number of paroral dikinetids (12-14 vs. 15-19), and
number of ciliary rows in the large nassulid organelle (about 15, as estimated from figure 63
in FOISSNER 1995 vs. 9-11). In vivo, C. trichocystiferum and -» C. caudatum can be rather
reliably distinguished not only by the lack of trichocysts but also by the body's lengthrwidth
ratio (1.9:1 vs. 2.5:1) and the location of the macronucleus (in middle vs. posterior third of
cell). Furthermore, the location of the buccal entrance is rather different (Fig. 111a—d): in
mid-body in C. trichocystiferum, slightly underneath mid-body in C. horribile, slightly above
or in mid-body in -> C. caudatum (FOISSNER 1995, WlLBERT 1986), and between first and
second third of cell in -» C. microstoma. Colpodidium viride (MIRABDULLAYEV, 1986)
JANKOWSKI, 1992 has symbiotic green algae, lacks trichocysts, and has a large, hook-shaped
nassulid organelle 3 (MIRABDULLAYEV 1986).
Colpodidium trichocystiferum is not to be confused with —» Apocolpodidium (Apocolpo-
didium) etoschense and Pedohymena australiensis, whose resting extrusomes have a very
similar size and shape. Interestingly, the exploded extrusomes of C. trichocystiferum look
very similar to haptorid toxicysts, while those of -» C. horribile, P. australiensis, —» A.
etoschense, —» A. macrostoma, and many other nassulids look similar to hymenostome
spindle trichocysts.
Generally, most colpodidids look rather similar at first glance, but on detailed observation
they can be distinguished even in vivo by the presence/absence of trichocysts, the location
and gross structure of the oral apparatus, and the location of the macronucleus.

Colpodidium {Colpodidium) microstoma nov. spec. (Fig. 112a—i; 362a-k,
363i-r; Table 91)
Diagnosis: Size about 65 x 27 urn in vivo; reniform. Macronucleus in posterior third of
cell. Cortical granules, possibly mucocysts, about 1 urn across. On average 24 somatic ciliary
rows and 9 paroral dikinetids. Buccal opening uniquely small and pre-equatorial. Nassulid
organelle 3 composed of about 11 ciliary rows.
Type location: Mud from granitic rock-pools on the Kruger Tablets in the Kruger
National Park, Republic of South Africa, 23°S 31°E.
Etymology: Greek substantive in apposition, referring to the uniquely small buccal
entrance.
Description: Size 55-80 x 23-35 urn in vivo. Shape fairly constant, lateral view slightly
reniform due to more or less distinct indentation at oral apparatus, dorsal side convex; ventral
and dorsal view elongate ellipsoidal because laterally slightly flattened (Fig. 112a, d; Table
91). Macronucleus invariably in posterior third of cell, globular, with reticular nucleolus.
Micronucleus globular, difficult to recognize because usually in shallow indentation of
macronucleus and faintly impregnated with protargol. Contractile vacuole near mid-body
underneath buccal cavity, surrounded by contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pore
in line with paroral membrane underneath right margin of buccal entrance, distinct even in
vivo. Cytopyge slit underneath excretory pore, about 21 urn long, extends in posterior body
half. Cortex 1.0-1.2 urn thick and bright, furrowed by ciliary rows, especially in anterior
body half, contains many minute, polygonal alveoli and curious granules, possibly some sort
of extrusomes, which make surface rough; granules rather conspicuous because 0.8-1 urn
across and bright, scattered, pale pink in bright field at certain light intensity and/or focal
plane, stain red, but are not extruded, after methyl green-pyronin application (Fig. 112i; 362b,
d, e). Subcortical mitochondria rather inconspicuous, although numerous, serpentine, and up
to 5 urn long, because only slightly refractive (Fig. 362a). Cells dark at low magnification due
to innumerable lipid droplets 1-3 urn across. Food vacuoles about 16 um across, probably
contain remnants of flagellates. Movement without peculiarities.
Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged; dorsal kineties bipolar, those on ventral
side form long, straight preoral suture because left side kineties abut obliquely on right side
kineties, which gradually shorten from anterior end of cell to oral apparatus (Fig. 112b, f;
362g-i; Table 91). Kinety 1 (first right of paroral) commences slightly above anterior quarter
of cell with monokinetids becoming more closely spaced from anterior to posterior, extends
along oral apparatus with closely spaced dikinetids, and usually terminates near mid-body
with a short tail of 1-4 ordinarily spaced monokinetids. Four postoral kineties: kinety 1
commences underneath, rarely left of minute nassulid organelle 1, monokinetidal throughout;
kinety 2 commences in buccal cavity, dikinetidal in anterior half, monokinetidal in posterior;
kinety 3 commences underneath nassulid organelle 3, dikinetidal anteriorly, monokinetidal
posteriorly; kinety 4 commences left of and slightly below level of excretory pore, mono-
kinetidal throughout (Fig. 112c, h; 362h).
Somatic cilia about 10 um long in vivo, single except for four to five dikinetids in kinety 1 at
level of buccal entrance, one to two dikinetids above excretory pore, probably three dikinetids

in anterior portion of postoral kinety 2, and probably one dikinetid at anterior end of postoral
kinety 3. Cilia closely spaced in anterior region of somatic kinety 1 and postoral kineties 2
and 3; distances between cilia increase from anterior to posterior, ciliature thus loosened in
rear pole area. Fibrillar (?) associates of somatic kinetids as described in —> C. horribile and
shown in figures 112h and 362h. Special features are: (i) kinetodesmal fibres not elongated in
postoral kineties; (ii) transverse fibres not elongated in preoral portion of kineties 1-3; (iii)
transverse fibre lacking in anterior, possibly unciliated basal body of dikinetids, at least in
kinety 1.
Upper end of paroral on average 29% back from anterior body end, buccal cavity thus
between first and second third of body. Buccal opening elliptical and very small, that is, only
about 3 urn wide; buccal cavity horn-shaped and rather inconspicuous because only up to 3
um wide and 6 urn long, contains nassulid organelle 3 and anterior portion of postoral kinety
2 (Fig. 112a, c, d, g; 362a, h, j, k; Table 91). Nassulid organelles without distinct fibres,
details difficult to recognize due to their small size. Nassulid organelle 1 usually between left
end of paroral and anterior end of postoral kinety 1, minute because consisting of only two

basal bodies. Nassulid organelle 2 probably at proximal end of postoral kinety 2, where a
slightly separated dikinetid occurs. Nassulid organelle 3 extends on dorsal wall of buccal
cavity to cytostome, orientated obliquely to main cell axis, slightly concave, composed of 10-
12 ciliary rows with three basal bodies each. Paroral membrane extends in flat bow along
right and upper margin of buccal entrance, fairly inconspicuous because composed of only 8-
10 rather widely spaced dikinetids orientated perpendicularly to kinety axis (Fig. 112c, g, h;
362g-k). Pharyngeal basket recognizable neither in vivo nor silver preparations.
Methyl green-pyronin produces a pattern which is highly similar to the silverline system of,
for instance, -» C. caudatum (FoiSSNER 1995) and —> Wolfkosia loeffleri: the alveolar content
stains red, while the alveolar walls remain unstained, showing the silverline pattern by
negative contrast (Fig. 112e; 362f).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found in the circumneutral (pH 6.5) mud from
type location and mud of an ephemeral puddle at the entrance to the Sydney Harbour National
Park, Australia.
Comparison with similar species: Colpodidium microstoma has a uniquely small
(< 3 jim), pre-equatorial buccal entrance. In the other members of the subgenus, the buccal
opening is larger and usually slightly underneath mid-body. The differences to —> C.
caudatum, possibly the nearest relative, become obvious on comparison of micrographs and
morphometrics: location of oral apparatus (29% vs. 33% of body length; Fig. 311), depth of
buccal cavity (arithmetic mean: 5.5 urn vs. 6.5 urn), number of paroral dikinetids (8-10 vs.
10-13), and number of ciliary rows in nassulid organelle 3 (10—12 vs. 12-14). Certainly,
these differences are not very conspicuous, especially considering the high variability of —> C.
caudatum. Thus, we emphasize as main species feature the minute oral entrance and the
cortical granules, both documented by micrographs (Fig. 362a-c, 363a-r). The lack of
trichocysts and symbiotic green algae distinguishes C. microstoma from —»• C. horribile, —• C.
trichocystiferum, and C. viride (MIRABDULLAYEV, 1986) JANKOWSKI, 1992.
Fortunately, we got useable SEM micrographs from the Australian population. They show
convincingly the minuteness of the oral entrance (Fig. 363i-r) when compared with that of—»
C. caudatum (Fig. 357b, c, 363a-h). Further, the micrographs show the buccal entrance
distinctly above mid-body (Fig. 363j, 1, m), and the pellicle covered with a slimy layer from
extruded mucocysts (Fig. 363p-r). Thus, Colpodidium (Colpodidium) microstoma is a distinct
species easy to recognize both in vivo and preparations.
Pseudocolpodidium nov. subgen.
Diagnosis: Buccal cavity pocket-shaped and directed rightwards. Paroral membrane
distinctly curved. Nassulid organelle 3 orientated perpendicularly to main body axis. Anterior,
dikinetidal portion of postoral kinety 2 sharply curved rightwards and thus appearing as an
additional nassulid organelle.
Type species: Colpodidium {Pseudocolpodidium) bradburyarum nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of pseudo (Greek; resembling) and Colpodidium.
488

Comparison with related genera: Pseudocolpodidium is distinguished from the
subgenus —>• Colpodidium mainly by the.shape (pocket-like vs. horn-like) and orientation
(rightwards vs. obliquely anteriad) of the buccal cavity. Correlated with these features are the
orientation of the (large) nassulid organelle 3 (perpendicularly vs. obliquely to main body
axis) and the sharp bend postoral kinety 2 performs anteriorly (Fig. 113d; 364f). Furthermore,
Pseudocolpodidium has only one dikinetidal postoral kinety and a more distinctly curved
paroral. However, these features must not be over-interpreted, not only because they are
sometimes difficult to recognize but also because, e.g., —> Colpodidium horribile has only one
to three dikinetids in postoral kinety 3.
—> Apocolpodidium lacks dikinetidal postoral kineties, while —> Pedohymena FOISSNER, 1995,
which probably lacks postoral dikinetids too, has a loop-shaped paroral membrane.
Colpodidium (Pseudocolpodidium) bradburyarum nov. spec. (Fig. 113a-k;
364a-j; Table 92)
Diagnosis: Size about 55 x 30 in vivo; conspicuously obovoidal. Usually 2 macronuclear
nodules. On average 23 somatic ciliary rows and 16 paroral dikinetids. Buccal cavity in
second quarter of cell. Nassulid organelle 3 composed of about 17 ciliary rows.
Type location: Soil from bottom of river overflow in Beijing, China, 40°N 117°E.
Etymology: We dedicate this new species to Prof. Dr. Phyllis BRADBURY as a small piece
of appreciation for her friendship over the years and her significant contributions to the
morphology and biology of the apostome ciliates.
Description: Size 40-70 x 25-40 urn in vivo. Shape fairly constant and conspicuous
because distinctly obovoidal making cells looking like swimming eggs; ventral view
obovoidal, lateral view ellipsoidal to obovoidal with ventral side usually flattened and dorsal
distinctly vaulted (Fig. 113a, i; Table 92); shape often poorly preserved in silver preparations.
Nuclear apparatus usually in posterior half of cell. Macronuclear nodules globular and often
abutting, with large globular nucleoli; of 29 specimens analyzed, 26 have two macronuclear
nodules, one has three, and two have only one nodule (Table 92). Micronuclei recognizable
neither in vivo nor in protargol and silver carbonate preparations. Contractile vacuole in mid-
body underneath buccal cavity; excretory pore in line with paroral membrane close to right
margin of buccal entrance. Cytopyge slit underneath excretory pore, extends in posterior half
of cell. Cortex thick and bright, punctated by ciliary pits, rather inflexible, usually strongly
wrinkled in protargol preparations. No trichocysts, but about 2 um-sized blisters (special kind
of mucocysts ?) are released on slight cover glass pressure providing cells with peculiar,
pustulated appearance; blisters do not stain with methyl green-pyronin or protargol, but
occasionally impregnate faintly with silver nitrate (Fig. 113j, k; 364a-c). Cells dark at low
magnification, especially in posterior half, due to countless, 1-2 um-sized, angular fat
inclusions. Food vacuoles 7—10 urn across, contain bacteria. Swims rather rapidly.
Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, except for slightly more closely spaced
postoral kineties, of which the anterior, dikinetidal portion of kinety 2 is sharply (-90°) bent
rightwards extending close above and along nassulid organelle 3. Dorsal and lateral ciliary

rows bipolar. Preoral suture short because formed by only three to four shortened ciliary rows
left of midline and one shortened row at right; nonetheless, rather conspicuous because fairly
wide and merging into comparatively large, ovate, unciliated anterior pole area. Kinety 1
(first right of paroral) commences subapically with ordinarily spaced monokinetids, extends
along oral apparatus with closely spaced, ciliated dikinetids, and abuts on cytopyge with short
(~3 kinetids), monokinetidal tail (Fig. 113e, g; 364d-j; Table 92). Four postoral kineties:
kinety 1 commences left of left end of paroral membrane, monokinetidal throughout; kinety 2
commences in proximal portion of buccal cavity, dikinetidal and orientated perpendicularly to
main body axis in anterior half, monokinetidal and orientated parallel to main body axis in
posterior half; kineties 3 and 4 commence at level of excretory pore of contractile vacuole
leaving blank a square area underneath oral apparatus, monokinetidal throughout (Fig. 113e,
g;364d, f, i,j).
Somatic cilia 8-10 urn long in vivo, single except for eight to thirteen dikinetids in kinety 1 at
level of oral apparatus, about two dikinetids around excretory pore, and six to eight dikinetids
in anterior portion of postoral kinety 2. Ciliature loosened in posterior pole area because
distances between cilia increase slightly from anterior to posterior. Fibrillar (?) associates of
somatic kinetids as described in —> C. horribile and shown in figures 113e and figures 364d-

f, i. Special features are: (i) kinetodesmal fibres not elongated in anterior portion of postoral
kineties; (ii) transverse fibres not elongated in preoral portion of kineties 1-3.
Buccal cavity in second quarter of cell, pocket-shaped, that is, extends dorsally and right-
wards almost parallel to cell surface, contains (large) nassulid organelle 3 and anterior,
dikinetidal portion of postoral kinety 2. Buccal entrance an obclavate slit, ventral buccal wall
with sharp, L-shaped margin, dorsal gradually deepening from left to right (Fig. 113a, b, d, e,
g-i; 364a-c; Table 92). Nassulid organelles without distinct fibres, details difficult to
recognize due to their small size (Fig. 113e, h; 364f). Nassulid organelle 1 between left end of
paroral and anterior end of postoral kinety 1, minute because consisting of only two basal
bodies. Nassulid organelle 2 probably near proximal end of postoral kinety 2, where a few
faintly impregnated and thus hardly recognizable basal bodies occur. Nassulid organelle 3
extends on dorsal wall of buccal cavity to cytostome, orientated perpendicularly to main body
axis, slightly concave, composed of 15-18 ciliary rows with three basal bodies each, except
for leftmost row comprising only two basal bodies. Paroral membrane conspicuous, even in
vivo, because composed of closely spaced cilia, extends along right and upper margin of
buccal entrance, distinctly curved, composed of 14-19 dikinetids orientated perpendicularly
to kinety axis. Pharyngeal basket commences at upper right vertex of buccal cavity and
extends anteriad, very delicate, only the distal portion could be recognized in vivo and silver
carbonate preparations (Fig. 364b, c, f).
Silverline system as in C. caudatum (FOISSNER 1995), that is, irregularly meshed producing
3-4 minute polygons between each two ciliary rows (Fig. 113f).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location. The sample was a
mixture of litter and moist, loamy, dark-brown soil (pH 6.7) inhabited by a highly diverse
ciliate community comprising 62 species.
Comparison with related species: Colpodidium (Pseudocolpodidium)
bradburyarum is easily distinguished from most (all?) nassulids by the two macronuclear
nodules and by the obovoidal body shape from all described Colpodidiidae, except for —»
Apocolpodidium (Phagoon) macrostoma, which, however, has a large oral apparatus with a
long, C-shaped paroral membrane. Furthermore, it differs from the other Colpodidiidae by the
main subgeneric features, viz., the pocket-shaped buccal cavity and horizontal orientation of
nassulid organelle 3.
Apocolpodidium nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Colpodidiidae FOISSNER, 1995 with keyhole-shaped, small and slightly
concave or large and rather deep buccal cavity. Paroral membrane short and slightly curved or
long and C-shaped. Nassulid organelle 3 orientated obliquely to main body axis. Postoral
kineties basically monokinetidal. Trichocysts simply fusiform or composed of fusiform shaft
and quadripartited head structure.
Type species: Apocolpodidium {Apocolpodidium) etoschense nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of apo (Greek prefix; derived from) and Colpodidium. Neuter
gender.
492

Classification and comparison with related genera: Apocolpodidium
belongs to the Colpodidiidae, according to the features discussed in the family classification.
It differs from —> Colpodidium WILBERT, 1982 in the shape of the buccal cavity (keyhole-
shaped vs. horn- or pocket-shaped) and the lack of dikinetidal postoral kineties. In the latter
feature, Apocolpodidium is similar to —> Pedohymena FOISSNER, 1995, which, however, has a
unique, loop-shaped paroral membrane and a broadly conical buccal cavity. As concerns
separation from Parafurgasonia spp., see "comparison with similar species" below.
Remarks: We discovered two colpodidiids, which look rather different at first glance due
to the distinctly different size of the oral apparatus. Furthermore, they have different
extrusomes. However, their infraciliature is very similar. Thus, we separate these new species
not at genus but subgenus level.
Apocolpodidium nov. subgen.
Diagnosis: Oral apparatus comparatively inconspicuous, that is, with small, flat buccal
cavity and short, slightly curved paroral membrane. Trichocysts fusiform.
Apocolpodidium {Apocolpodidium) etoschense nov. spec. (Fig. 114a-o; 279-
282, 365a-y; Table 93)
Diagnosis: Size about 65 x 30 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. Trichocysts about 7 urn long. On
average 19 somatic ciliary rows and 17 paroral dikinetids. Buccal cavity in second quarter of
cell. Nassulid organelle 3 composed of about 4 ciliary rows.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of EtoshaPan, Namibia, 18°45'S 16°45'E
(site 70 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the site discovered.
Description: Size 55-75 x 25-35 urn in vivo. Lateral view ellipsoidal with ventral
margin flattened and dorsal distinctly vaulted, anteriorly occasionally slightly broader
rounded than posteriorly; flattened-up to 2:1, ventral and dorsal view thus elongate ellipsoidal
with slightly projecting preoral suture forming some sort of frontal plate (Fig. 114a, 1, m;
365a, b, e, f; Table 93). Macronucleus usually in posterior half of cell, globular, with
comparatively large, irregularly shaped nucleoli. Micronucleus usually attached to macro-
nucleus, globular. Contractile vacuole in second quarter of cell, surrounded by contributory
vesicles during diastole; excretory pore underneath paroral membrane, about 1.5 urn in
diameter, distinct even in vivo. Cytopyge slit in line with excretory pore, extends in posterior
body third. Resting trichocysts attached almost perpendicularly to cortex close to left
posterior side of kinetids in anterior half of cell and to left anterior side in posterior half of
cell, rarely between kineties; protrude slightly from body proper in Austrian and distinctly so
in Namibian specimens making the latter somewhat spiny at middle and high magnification;
form distinct fringe, fusiform, in vivo about 7 x 0.8 urn in Namibian and 8-10 x 1 urn in
493

494

Austrian specimens; fusiform and up to 60 x 1.3 urn when exploded (Fig. 114a, k, n, o; 279-
282, 365a-d, g-j). Cortex up to 1 urn thick and bright, distinctly punctated by trichocysts and
large ciliary pits; mitochondria close underneath cortex, conspicuous because serpentine and
about 5 urn long (Fig. 114c; 365a-c). Cytoplasm colourless and very hyaline, contains 1-5
um-sized, bright, angular inclusions (possibly compacted spirilli) and, in Austrian specimens,
6-9 um-sized vacuoles with fine content, possibly remnants of flagellates. Glides moderately
rapidly on microscope slide, jerky when trichocysts are extruded.
Somatic cilia only about 5 urn long in vivo, loosened in posterior pole area and underneath
paroral membrane; distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior,
especially in ciliary rows right of oral opening. Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly
arranged, abut on frontal plate forming distinct preoral suture. Four basically monokinetidal
postoral kineties (Fig. 114d, e, i; 279-282, 365k, 1): kinety 1 commences at level and left of
oral opening; kinety 2 commences, possibly with two dikinetids, at left side of nassulid
organelle 3; kinety 3 commences at distal end of nassulid organelle 3; kinety 4 commences at
level of excretory pore of contractile vacuole. Somatic infraciliature composed of
monokinetids, except for some dikinetids usually found around the excretory pore of the
contractile vacuole. Silver carbonate preparations reveal kinetids to be composed of (i) an
irregular (possibly due to attached parasomal sac and/or alveolocyst and/or trichocyst)
granule bearing the cilium; (ii) a short structure (kinetodesmal fibre?) extending obliquely
anteriad at right side; and (iii) a short structure (transverse fibre?) extending almost
perpendicularly to the kinety axis at left side of basal body (Fig. 114e; 365k, 1).
Oral apparatus in second quarter of cell. Oral opening marked by heavily argyrophilic ring in
silver carbonate preparations, pharyngeal basket, however, recognizable neither in vivo nor in
silver preparations. Buccal cavity flatter than in —> Colpodidium and —» Pedohymena,
conspicuously keyhole-shaped not only due to the sculpturing of the oral cortex but also due
to the roughly E-shaped, hyaline lip at right merging into oral cortex anteriorly and into
somatic cortex posteriorly (Fig. 114a, b; 279-282, 365a, p; Table 93). Nassulid organelles
without distinct fibres, details difficult to recognize, even in excellent preparations (Fig.
114d-i; 279-282, 365i, k, 1), due to their small size. Organelle 1 left of buccal entrance, very
likely composed of a single basal body. Organelle 2 in buccal cavity, probably comprising
two basal bodies. Organelle 3 underneath oral opening in rather deep indentation, orientated
obliquely to main body axis, composed of about four ciliary rows, anteriormost row with five
basal bodies16, other rows with three basal bodies each; some variations occur (Fig. 114f—h).
Paroral membrane conspicuous even in vivo because of the closely spaced, 5 urn long cilia
originating from the right basal body of the dikinetids, extends in flat bow along buccal cavity
at base of buccal lip, distinctly set off from somatic ciliary rows, composed of 13-17
dikinetids arranged perpendicularly to kinety axis; left (unciliated) basal body of dikinetids
associated with short argyrophilic structure (postciliary microtubule ribbon?) extending
parallel to kinety axis posteriad (Fig. 114a, b, d, e, i; 279-282, 365a, b, k-u).
Silverline system as in Colpodidium caudatum (FOISSNER 1995), that is, irregularly meshed in
somatic and oral cortex producing 2-3 minute polygons between each two ciliary rows;
meshes often filled with argyrophilic substance in suboptimal preparations (Fig. 114j).
Ontogenesis: A middle divider was found in the preparations of the Austrian population
16 The two leftmost basal bodies rather distinctly set off and thus possibly belonging to postoral kinety 2.
495

(Fig. 365y). It highly resembles middle dividers of -> Colpodidium and -» Pedohymena
(FOISSNER 1995). A reorganization of the proter's oral apparatus is indicated by the absence of
the heavily impregnated ring marking the oral opening and the zigzagging basal bodies in the
slightly straightened and shortened paroral membrane. The opisthe's oral apparatus looks very
similar to that of the proter, and in both are the three nassulid organelles now clearly
recognizable.
Occurrence and ecology: Apocolpodidium (Apocolpodidium) etoschense was
discovered in highly saline soil from Namibian site (70) and later found in a moderately
saline grassland soil (pH 7.9) from the littoral of the Neusiedlersee, a soda lake in the "hell"
region near Illmitz, Burgenland, Austria (47°45"N 16°48'E). It was rather abundant at both
sites. In spite of the great spatial distance, the Austrian and Namibian specimens match so
well that not a single different feature could be found (Fig. 365q, s-y). There are some
morphometrical differences which, however, are minute and fall into the range usually
encountered in different populations (Table 93). Obviously, A. etoschense is a euryhaline
cosmopolitan with great morphological stability.

Comparison with similar species: Easily confused, especially in vivo, with other
small nassulids because the familial and generic features are difficult to recognize. In silver
carbonate preparations most features are recognizable making identification rather easy,
except for some small Parafurgasonia species, especially P. protectissima, as redescribed by
FOISSNER (1999b). Indeed, Parafurgasonia protectissima and A. etoschense are so similar in
most respects that it is only the pharyngeal basket (a conspicuous funnel extending posteriorly
vs. invisible likely extending anteriorly) which separates them unequivocally in vivo and
protargol slides. In vivo, A. etoschense differs from P. protectissima also by the deeper and
more richly structured buccal cavity, especially by the pit containing nassulid organelle 3.
Parafurgasonia terricola FOISSNER, 1999b lacks trichocysts.
Phagoon nov. subgen.
Diagnosis: Oral apparatus conspicuous, that is, with large, rather deep buccal cavity and
long, C-shaped paroral membrane. Trichocysts composed of fusiform shaft and quadripartited
head structure.
Type species: Apocolpodidium {Phagoon) macrostoma nov. spec.
Etymology: Phagoon is a composite of the Greek substantives phagon (feed) and oon
497

(egg), referring to the large mouth and obovoidal body shape of the organism. Actually, the
name means a "feeding egg" in analogy of, for instance, a phagocyte. Neuter gender.
Comparison with related genera: Phagoon is easily distinguished, even in vivo,
from -» Apocolpodidium, -» Pedohymena, and —>• Colpodidium by the main subgeneric
feature, namely, the very large buccal cavity bordered at right and upper margin by a long, C-
shaped paroral membrane.
The compound resting trichocysts of Apocolpodidium {Phagoon) macrostoma are highly
remarkable and regarded as a subgeneric feature (Fig. 115k-m; 366a, b, g, i, j). As yet,
compound trichocysts were mainly reported from the nassuline order Microthoracida
(HAUSMANN 1978). In the exploded state, however, the trichocysts of Apocolpodidium
{Phagoon) macrostoma are likely simple spindle trichocysts (Fig. 115n), and thus differ from
those of the microthoracids by the lack of the four highly characteristic, spread head
structures. However, we cannot exclude to have overlooked small appendages.
Apocolpodidium {Phagoon) macrostoma nov. spec. (Fig. 115a-o; 286, 366a-
m; Table 94)
Diagnosis: Size about 45 x 25 urn in vivo; conspicuously obovoidal. Trichocysts
approximately 7 urn long. About 15-17 somatic ciliary rows and 33 paroral dikinetids.
Buccal cavity in anterior half of cell. Nassulid organelle 3 composed of about four ciliary
rows.
Type location: Soil from the Everglades in Florida, USA, 26°N 81 °W.
Etymology: Greek substantive in apposition, referring to the large oral apparatus
occupying one third of body length and half of body width.
Description: Size 40-60 x 20-30 urn in vivo. Shape fairly constant and conspicuous,
namely, ventral and dorsal view obovoidal with slightly pointed anterior and distinctly
tapered posterior end; lateral view ellipsoidal to obovoidal with ventral side usually flattened
and dorsal distinctly vaulted (Fig. 115a—d, h; 366a, b; Table 94). Macronucleus uniquely in
anterior third of cell, about 13 urn across in vivo and with lobate nucleoli. Micronucleus
usually adjacent to macronucleus, globular (Fig. 115a; 366c, d, m). Contractile vacuole
underneath mid-body in midline of cell, surrounded by contributory vesicles during diastole;
excretory pore in line but distinctly apart from paroral membrane, recognizable also in vivo
(Fig. 115a, b; 366a, b). Cytopyge slit underneath excretory pore, extends in posterior body
third. Resting trichocysts attached almost perpendicularly to cortex close to left posterior
margin of some somatic kinetids in anterior half of cell and to left anterior margin of some
kinetids in posterior half of cell; although sparse conspicuous because 7 x 1.0-1.3 urn and
thus large compared to size of cell (Fig. 115a; 366a, b, g); shape highly remarkable, that is,
composed of fusiform shaft plugging in quadripartited head structure; very slenderly
fusiform, 50-70 urn long, and likely lacking appendages (see genus comparison) when
exploded (Fig. 115k-n; 366a, b, i, j). Trichocysts do not impregnate with protargol, but their
quadripartited head stains, occasionally, intensely with silver carbonate or silver nitrate, produ-
cing a peculiar, spotted appearance of impregnated specimens (Fig. 286, 366d, k). Cortex up

to 1 um thick and bright; mitochondria underneath cortex conspicuous because numerous,
serpentine, and up to 10 urn long (Fig. 115o; 366a, g, h). Cells rather dark at low magnifica-
tion due to countless, 2-3 ^m-sized, angular fat inclusions. Food vacuoles 6-10 urn across,
appear usually almost empty. Movement without peculiarities.
Somatic cilia about 9 urn long in vivo, not elongated but loosened in posterior pole area
because distances between individual cilia increase from anterior to posterior, especially in
somatic kinety 1. Ciliary rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, almost of same
length, preoral suture thus indistinct. Four monokinetidal postoral kineties (Fig. 115b, f; 286,
366d, k, 1; Table 94): kinety 1 commences underneath left end of paroral membrane; kinety 2
commences, possibly with two dikinetids, at left side of nassulid organelle 3; kinety 3
commences at distal end of nassulid organelle 3; and kinety 4 commences usually underneath
dikinetids below right end of paroral membrane. Somatic ciliature composed of mono-
kinetids, except for some dikinetids underneath right end of paroral membrane. Silver
carbonate preparations reveal each somatic kinetid to be composed of (i) an irregular
(possibly due to attached parasomal sac and/or alveolocyst and/or trichocyst) granule bearing
the cilium; (ii) a short structure (kinetodesmal fibre?) extending obliquely anteriad at right
side of basal body; and (iii) a short structure (transverse fibre?) extending obliquely anteriad
at left side of basal body (Fig. 115f; 286, 366f, 1, m).
Oral apparatus in anterior half of cell, conspicuously large, that is, occupies about one third of
body length and half of body width. Oral opening near right posterior end of paroral, that is,
in right comer of buccal cavity, marked by heavily argyrophilic ring in silver carbonate
preparations; pharyngeal basket, however, recognizable neither in vivo nor in silver prepara-
tions. Buccal cavity conspicuous because large compared to size of cell and key-hole shaped,
that is, broadened anteriorly and narrowed posteriorly; consists of a flat portion extending
wedge-like from right to left end of paroral and a smaller, ellipsoidal, rather abruptly
deepened part containing nassulid organelle 3 and oral opening in right corner (Fig. 115a, e;
286, 366a, b, d, g; Table 94). Nassulid organelles without distinct fibres, details difficult to
recognize due to their small size (Fig. 115b, f, i, j; 286, 366d-f, k, 1). Nassulid organelle 1 at
left slope of buccal entrance underneath left end of paroral membrane, minute because
consisting of only two granules lighter impregnated than paroral and somatic kinetids.
Nassulid organelle 2 at posterior slope of buccal cavity, close to organelle 3, appears as
heavily impregnated, obliquely orientated, rectangular structure in silver carbonate
preparations, probably composed of about five basal bodies. Nassulid organelle 3 underneath
oral opening in rather deep and narrow indentation, orientated obliquely to main body axis,
composed of four ciliary rows, anteriormost row with five basal bodies", other rows with
three basal bodies each; occasionally, the three rightmost basal bodies of the anteriormost row
apparently lacking (Fig. 115i, j). Paroral membrane very conspicuous because long and C-
shaped, extends along upper and right slope of buccal entrance, composed of about 31-35
dikinetids orientated perpendicularly to kinety axis and having only one basal body ciliated;
left (unciliated) basal body of dikinetids associated with short argyrophilic structure
(postciliary microtubule ribbon?) extending parallel to kinety axis posteriad; distances
between dikinetids increase slightly from right to left (Fig. 115a, f; 286, 366d-g).
Silverline system as in Colpodidium caudatum (FoiSSNER 1995), that is, irregularly meshed in
The two leftmost basal bodies are rather distinctly set off and thus possibly belong to postoral kinety 2.

somatic and oral cortex, producing about four polygons between each two ciliary rows (Fig.
115g;366k,m).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in a sample collected by Miss Gerlinde
FISCHER near the "Pine Trail" in the Everglades of Florida (USA) in 1990. The sample, in
which the species was rather rare, was a mixture of conifer needles, mosses, lichens, and soil
particles. As this is a conspicuous species, it is unlikely that we overlooked it in any of the
1000 other soil samples studied, suggesting that it is either extremely rare and/or has a
restricted geographic distribution.
Comparison with related species: Apocolpodidium (Phagoon) macrostoma is
easily distinguished from all other colpodidiids and furgasoniids by the large oral apparatus
and the location of the nuclear apparatus in the anterior third of the cell. Its obovoidal body
shape is similar to that of —» Colpodidium (Pseudocolpodidium) bradburyarum and ->
Woljkosia loeffleri: the former lacks trichocysts and has a distinctly smaller oral apparatus
with a pocket-shaped buccal cavity; the latter has a comparatively inconspicuous oral
apparatus with a rather distinct pharyngeal basket.

HYMENOSTOMATA
Frontonia EHRENBERG, 1838
Four Frontonia species or subspecies occur in the Etosha Pan region. At first glance, three of
them look rather similar, especially because they have several excretory pores. However,
more detailed investigations provide sufficient features for a reliable separation (Table 95).
Frontonia depressa, which is very common in many soils world-wide, occurs in Namibia
only at site 66 (Table 4). Frontonia depressa and its junior synonym, F. parvula, are easily
distinguished from the other species by the single excretory pore (Fig. 116a, b; FOISSNER
1987b, GIL & PEREZ-SILVA 1964b, KAHL 1931, ROQUE 1961a). We introduce the shape of the
postoral suture in alpha-taxonomy of Frontonia. With this simple and easy-to-use feature, —>
F. terricola can be clearly distinguished from the other species mentioned in table 95 (Fig.
116b, d, 117i, 118o; 367a-l). The shape of the preoral suture, in contrast, varies only slightly
and its orientation is influenced by the angle the cell is viewed. Furthermore, details of the
oral structures, which are increasingly used in species definitions of Frontonia, are doubtful
in our experience because highly dependent on the methods used and at the limits of
microscope resolution (Fig. 368h).

Improved diagnosis: Size about 80-150 x 35-110 urn in vivo. Shape obovoidal with
rounded or truncate anterior end, or elongate obovoidal with rounded anterior end; unflat-
tened with buccal cavity in midline, or more or less distinctly (up to 4:1) flattened with buccal
cavity near body margin in gliding specimens. Single contractile vacuole with 2-6 excretory
pores. 56-105 ciliary rows including 2-5 postoral kineties. Dorsal portion of postoral suture a
distinct, oblique stripe. Usually 4 vestibular kineties. Peniculus 3 slightly curved.
Remarks: We split F. angusta into three subspecies with similar main features (several
excretory pores, same pattern of postoral suture, similar size of body and oral apparatus), but
503

distinctly different details (Fig. 367d—1; Table 96). The most important of these is body shape,
which is so different that the subspecies are rather easily distinguished. We are aware that this
is a problematic feature, often highly dependent on nutrition. However, the general appear-
ance of, for instance, —» F. angusta solea and —> F. angusta obovata is so different in vivo
that they look like different species, although it is mainly body flattening which produces this
appearance. Certainly, there are also quite a lot of morphometric differences, some of which
do not even overlap, between these subspecies (Table 96). However, they must be handled
with care because Frontonia species, for instance, F. leucas, are highly variable (FOISSNER et
al. 1994).
Frontonia acuminata differs from its former variety angusta by the pigment patch in the
anterior dorsal side and the cap-shaped transverse body outline (FOISSNER et al. 1994, KAHL
1931b). The pigment patch, an accumulation of highly refractive granules, and the acuminate
posterior body end are highly characteristic features found in all "typical" F. acuminata
populations. Thus, F. acuminata and F. acuminata angusta, which lacks these characteristics,
should be separated at species level.
FOISSNER et al. (1994) suppose Frontonia bullingtoni DRAGESCO, 1960 and F. roqueae
DRAGESCO, 1970 (nom. corr. for F. roquei DRAGESCO, 1970) to be synonyms of F. angusta.
Synonymy, however, need to be substantiated by more detailed investigations.

Locus classicus: Außenalster, Hamburg (Germany), where KAHL (1931b) discovered
F. angusta angusta in mud.
Remarks: Redescribed by FOISSNER et al. (1994). Here, we provide the complete
morphometry and some additional observations of a cultivated population from a meadow
puddle in the surroundings of Salzburg, Austria. These specimens are in fact rather similar to
—» Frontonia angusta obovata. However, the body is usually less obovate and wide, and the
anterior region is never as truncate as in —> F. angusta obovata. Furthermore, the cells are
slightly to strongly flattened, shifting the oral apparatus to the body margin in gliding
specimens (Fig. 118p, q; 367J-1).

vivo obovoidal with narrowly rounded posterior and broadly rounded, never truncate anterior
end; distinctly (up to 4:1) flattened laterally, flattening, as is usual, rarely preserved in silver
preparations, where shape is rather variable: obovoidal to elongate obovoidal or ellipsoidal to
elongate ellipsoidal; length:width ratio 1.6-2.5:1, usually 2.1:1 in lateral view (Fig. 117a-c,
g-i, m, n; 367g-i, 368a, b, e-g; Table 98). Nuclear apparatus usually in anterior body half.

or lateral indentation of macronucleus, about 7 urn across in live cells from Austria, while
only 3 x2 urn in silver nitrate-impregnated specimens from Namibia. Contractile vacuole
with 2—4 excretory pores slightly underneath mid-body in Austrian and slightly above mid-
body in Namibian specimens; surrounded by contributory vesicles during diastole, but
without collecting canals. Cytopyge extends in ventral portion of postoral suture. Resting

somes filiform, about 50 urn long, with small, conical tip; occasionally bent hook-like in
anterior portion (Fig. 117d, e). Cortex bright and rigid, except for postoral region, where cells
easily rupture under cover glass pressure. Cytoplasm without special inclusions, contains
yellow-green granules mainly in posterior portion and some large fat globules. Feeds on
filamentous cyanobacteria, in Namibia also on pennate diatoms up to 31 jim long and testate
amoebae. Movement without peculiarities.
Somatic cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, except for slightly elongated caudal cilia. 50-66
meridional, equidistant ciliary rows form a suture in ventral midline of cell (Fig. 117g-j, m-p;
Table 98). Preoral suture commences at vertex of buccal cavity and extends straight ahead
across anterior pole terminating subapically on dorsal side, about 2-2.5 urn wide. Postoral
suture extends as a line from right posterior corner of buccal cavity to rear end, where it
widens to 2-2.5 urn, passes the pole, and ends subterminally as counter-clockwise inclined
stripe. Ventral kineties shorten gradually from both cell ends to oral apparatus, abut obliquely
on both sutures, except for three or four postoral kineties commencing underneath buccal
cavity. Dorsal ciliary rows almost bipolar, except for those extending between sutures. Cilia
paired in oral body portion, some pairs also postorally, as revealed by protargol impregnation
and scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 117h, i; 368a, b). Silver carbonate impregnations
show (Fig. 368c): (i) a curious impregnation attribute of the dikinetids, viz., only the basal
body with the kinetodesmal fibre impregnates, although both are ciliferous; (ii) distinct
kinetodesmal fibres decreasing in length from anterior to posterior; (iii) vestibular and
postoral kinetids more heavily impregnated than ordinary kinetids, possibly because
associated with unstained nematodesmata; and (iv) fine fibres originating from the peniculi.
Oral apparatus about 17% back from anterior body end and near body margin in gliding
specimens due to distinct body flattening, about 25 urn long in live specimens from Austria,
about 20 urn long in Namibian population. Buccal cavity pointed arch-shaped, symmetrical,
with three almost parallel, slightly curved peniculi (adoral membranelles, ophryokineties) on
left wall and paroral and vestibular kineties on right. Peniculus 1 about 18 urn long, anteriorly
curved hook-like to right side of cavity, composed of four or five rows of basal bodies
posteriorly gradually shortened from right to left. Peniculus 2 about 15 urn long, composed of
five kineties in Austrian and three or four in Namibian specimens, posteriorly gradually
shortened from right to left; slightly separated anterior portion recognizable only in two out of
eight Namibian specimens. Peniculus 3 about 13 urn long, composed of three or four kineties
gradually shortened from right to left. Paroral membrane commences ahead of peniculus 3
and extends along right margin of buccal cavity, composed of two rows of very closely
spaced basal bodies (Fig. 117g, h, k; 368a-d; Table 98).
Vestibular kineties posteriorly gradually shortened from right to left and thus obliquely
abutting on postoral suture, composed of rather closely spaced dikinetids, except for distal
portion of kineties 3 and 4, where dikinetids are usually very densely, respectively, normally
(as in somatic kineties) spaced (Fig. 117g, h, j, k; 368c). Orientation of dikinetids (oblique or
parallel to kinety axis) was studied very carefully and proved to be highly variable for
unknown reasons (Fig. 117h, k). Parasomal sacs recognizable only in kinety 4 and proximal
portion of other vestibular kineties. First kinety easily overlooked because, as in many
congeners (BERAN 1990, GIL & PEREZ-SILVA 1964a, b, ROQUE 1961a, b, c, ROQUE &
PUYTORAC 1972), very close to paroral membrane, longer than paroral by 2-5 kinetids and
thus terminating about 38% back from anterior body end. Second kinety commences in five
of nine Namibian specimens near distal end of peniculus 1 and terminates about 44% back

from anterior body end; in other specimens probably anteriorly shortened commencing near
level of mid-buccal cavity (Fig. 117h, k). Third kinety commences above buccal vertex and
terminates at about mid-body. Fourth kinety commences above buccal vertex and usually
terminates 54% back from anterior body end (Table 98).
Fibrillar apparatus associated with oral and postoral ciliature after protargol impregnation
similar as described by DIDIER (1970), that is, consists of (i) very thick nematodesmata
separated from proximal end of basal bodies of vestibular kinety 4 by a minute unstained gap;
(ii) thick nematodesmata separated from proximal end of basal bodies of peniculus 3 by a
minute unstained gap; and (iii) rather fine fibre bundles associated with kinetids of at least
anterior portion of postoral kineties and posterior portion of vestibular kineties (Fig. 117k, 1).
Kinetids of postoral and vestibular kineties contribute to oral basket, and are thus oralized
somatic kinetids in the sense of FOISSNER & FOISSNER (1988).
Silverline system only recognizable in dry silver nitrate impregnations of Austrian population,
composed of (i) silverlines in cortical ridges forming longitudinal rows of tetra- to polygonal
meshes and (ii) longitudinal silverlines connecting the regularly alternating kinetids and
extrusome attachment sites, dividing each mesh into a small right and a broad left portion
(Fig. 117f)-
Occurrence and ecology: Frontonia angusta solea was discovered in wet mosses
from Austria. In Namibia, it occurred at sites (65) and (70), that is, in highly saline, alkaline,
occasionally flooded soils. The species is obviously rare but euryhaline and cosmopolitan.
Comparison with related species: The original description of Frontonia solea
bases mainly on live observations of an Austrian population and does not provide detailed
morphometrics (FOISSNER 1987b). When this species was established, FOISSNER (1987b)
definitely stated the similarity to F. angusta KAHL, 1931b, which, however, was still poorly
known at that time. With the new data available (Table 98 and FOISSNER et al. 1994), it turns
out that F. solea is best considered as a subspecies of —> F. angusta. In vivo, F. angusta solea
is rather easily distinguished from -> F. angusta angusta and —» F. angusta obovata by the
elongate, distinctly flattened body, a feature unfortunately often lost in preparations.
Furthermore, solea is the smallest of the three subspecies and thus has distinctly fewer ciliary
rows (< 70 vs. > 90; Table 96).
Frontonia angusta obovata nov. sspec. (Fig. 118a-k, m-o; 367d-f, 369a-i;
Tables 96, 99)
Diagnosis: Size about 125 x 70 urn in vivo. Obovoidal with truncate anterior region. On
average 5 excretory pores and 92 ciliary rows. Buccal cavity in body midline in gliding
specimens, in vivo approximately 30 urn long occupying about one fourth of body length.
Type location: Slightly saline soil from Etosha National Park, Namibia, 19°S 15°40'E
(site 56 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective obovatus refers to the inverted egg-shaped outline.
511

Description: Shape and size were studied in specimens from raw (non-flooded Petri dish)
and pure cultures. The other morphometrical data base on cells from a pure culture.
Size 99-146 x 46-104 urn in silver nitrate-impregnated specimens from raw culture, while
slightly smaller and less variable (85-140 x 44-78 urn) in specimens from pure culture
(Table 99). Shape obovoidal with truncate anterior body region, providing cells with a
conspicuous, obovoidal outline; in detail, however, highly variable, especially in the non-
flooded Petri dish culture, that is, in 70% of 20 silver nitrate-impregnated specimens
obovoidal, in 10% elongate obovoidal, in 15% broadly ellipsoidal, and in 5% elongate
ellipsoidal (Fig. 118a, g-k, m; 367d-f). Truncate anterior region very conspicuous in vivo,
less so in silver preparations although at least recognizable in about 75% of specimens. Cells
slightly flattened laterally in raw culture; length:width ratio thus about 1.7:1 in ventral and
1.6:1 in lateral view, where shape is broadly obovoidal, broadly ellipsoidal or ellipsoidal with
indistinctly flattened ventral and convex dorsal side. Specimens from pure cultures slightly
dorsoventrally flattened and thus more slender than those from raw culture in lateral view
(length:width ratio 1.9:1 vs. 1.6:1). Location of nuclear apparatus rather variable, that is, in
anterior or middle third of cell, on average slightly above mid-body. Macronucleus usually
broadly ellipsoidal, in three out of 15 specimens investigated elongate ellipsoidal, in three
specimens globular (possibly because seen from short axis); nucleoli numerous and 1-2 urn
across. Probably only one micronucleus attached to macronucleus, in vivo about 3 urn across
and surrounded by a distinct membrane. Contractile vacuole dorsolateral, with 3-6, usually 5
excretory pores slightly above mid-body (Table 99); no collecting canals. Cytopyge extends
in ventral portion of postoral suture. Resting extrusomes form conspicuous fringe because
attached almost perpendicularly to cortex between each two kinetids of a ciliary row (see also
below). Shape peculiar, that is, composed of an about 4.5 urn long and 0.8 urn wide, cuneate,
slightly inflated shaft and an about 1.5 urn long, conical tip; exploded organelles elongate
fusiform, about 50 um long and with refractive tip, anterior portion occasionally curved as in
congeners (Fig. 118b, c; FoiSSNER 1987b). Cortex weak in postoral region, where cells
rupture easily under cover glass pressure. Cytoplasm colourless, that is, without any granule
patch, contains numerous crystals 2—4 urn in size (Fig. 118e). Food vacuoles contain green
algae from various taxa, one specimen had a diatom almost as long as its body ingested.
Movement without peculiarities. Resting cysts observed but not studied in detail.
Somatic cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, rather stiff and closely spaced; no caudal cilia. 83-
101 meridional, equidistant ciliary rows form a suture in ventral midline of cell (Fig. 118m,
o). Preoral suture commences at vertex of buccal cavity and extends straight ahead across
anterior pole to first eighth of dorsal side, 2-2.5 um wide. Postoral suture extends as a line
from right posterior comer of buccal cavity to rear end, where it widens to 2-2.5 jam, passes
the pole, and ends subterminally as counter-clockwise inclined stripe. Ventral kineties shorten
gradually from both cell ends to oral apparatus, abut obliquely on postoral suture and almost
perpendicularly on preoral suture, except for 2—4 postoral kineties commencing underneath
buccal cavity. Dorsal ciliary rows almost bipolar, except those extending between sutures.
Silver carbonate and silver nitrate preparations reveal kineties to be composed of irregularly
alternating pairs and triplets of granules, very likely monokinetids and dikinetids with a
parasomal sac (ALLEN 1971; Fig. 118m, o; 369a). A kinetodesmal fibre extends obliquely
anteriad on right side of kinetids.
Oral apparatus about 20% back from anterior end, of ordinary size, that is, occupies about 1/4
of body length and 1/7 of body width (Table 99; FoiSSNER et al. 1994). Buccal cavity pointed

arch-shaped, symmetrical, with three almost parallel, slightly curved peniculi (adoral
membranelles, ophryokineties) on left wall and paroral and vestibular kineties on right (Fig.
118f, m; 369a-i). Peniculus 1 about 26 urn long, anteriorly curved hook-like to right wall of
cavity, composed of four or five kineties; marginal kineties irregular, that is, shortened
anteriorly or posteriorly or comprising only a few scattered basal bodies. Peniculus 2 about 24
urn long, composed of four kineties posteriorly gradually shortened from right to left;
occasionally, a fifth kinety occurs on left, but is inconspicuous because comprising only a
few, usually scattered basal bodies. Peniculus 3 about 19 urn long, composed of three kineties
posteriorly gradually shortened from right to left; a fourth kinety usually occurs on left, but is
inconspicuous because comprising only a few scattered basal bodies (Table 99). Paroral
membrane commences anteriorly of peniculus 3 and extends along right margin of buccal
cavity, composed of two rows of very closely spaced basal bodies.
Vestibular kineties posteriorly gradually shortened from right to left and thus obliquely
abutting on postoral suture, composed of very closely spaced granules; fine structure highly
depending on impregnation conditions (Fig. 118f; 369a—i). Very likely, they basically consist
of dikinetids (BERAN 1990) each with a parasomal sac, which impregnates more lightly or not
at all. Of 31 specimens analyzed in silver nitrate preparations or photographed after silver
carbonate impregnation, 29 had four vestibular kineties and 2 had three (Fig. 369f). First
kinety easily overlooked because, as in most congeners (BERAN 1990, GIL & PEREZ-SILVA
1964a, b, ROQUE 1961a, b, c, ROQUE & PUYTORAC 1972), very close to paroral membrane;
longer than paroral by 4-14 kinetids and thus terminating about 52% back from anterior body
end. Second kinety commences, like paroral membrane, near distal end of peniculus 1 and
usually terminates 57% back from anterior body end. Third and fourth kinety commence
above buccal vertex, that is, roof over all peniculi and usually terminate 62%, respectively,
66% back from anterior body end (Table 99).
Silverline system recognizable only in heavily impregnated specimens, composed of
rectangular, longitudinally orientated meshes (about 2 x 2.5 urn) and thus similar to that of
most congeners (FOISSNER 1987b, KLEIN 1930, ROQUE 1961a, b, c); forms herring-bone
pattern in preoral suture and rectangular, obliquely or perpendicularly orientated meshes in
dorsal portion of postoral suture. Kinetids connected by longitudinal silverlines and not
within meshes; extrusome attachment sites marked by a granule at vertices of longitudinal
and horizontal silverlines, that is, between each two kinetids (Fig. 118d). Silver carbonate
occasionally impregnates the infraciliary lattice (Fig. 369a).
Occurrence and ecology: Frontonia angusta obovata was discovered in a Moringa
forest soil of the Etosha National Park (site 56). The sample was a mixture of slightly saline,
circumneutral (pH 7.8), powder-like soil and grass roots. However, we found the species also
in a highly alkaline (pH 9.7) and saline soil of this area (site 67). Furthermore, F. angusta
obovata occurred in a circumneutral (pH 6.5) soil sample from the dry bed of the Mlambane
River in the Kruger National Park (24°S 32°E), Republic of South Africa (collected in 1992
by Mag. Eric STROBL, Salzburg). Obviously, F. angusta obovata is euryhaline and widespread
in subtropical Africa.
Comparison with related species: Frontonia angusta obovata is a really conspi-
cuous ciliate because it is so voluminous, has the oral apparatus in body midline, and often has a
broadly truncate anterior body end (Fig. 118a, m, o). This and the basically identical oral struc-
tures make F. angusta obovata highly similar to Disematostoma buetschlii, which, however,
516

has an elongate reniform macronucleus and a very long postoral suture ending at the
excretory pore of the contractile vacuole, that is, near mid-body of dorsal side (for a brief
review, see FOISSNER et al. 1994). Accordingly, Disematostoma might be considered as a
junior synonym of Frontonia. It is beyond the present monograph to discuss this problem in
more detail. Frontonia angusta obovata also shows some similarities with —» Frontonia
terricola, especially in having an obovoidal body shape and several excretory pores (Table
95). However, —» F. terricola has a much larger oral apparatus and the postoral suture hardly
extends onto the dorsal side (Fig. 116c, d; 367b; Table 95). Furthermore, —> F. terricola is
usually smaller (< 90 urn vs. > 90 urn) than F. angusta obovata and thus has fewer ciliary
rows (60-78 vs. 83-101). Accordingly, both are distinct taxa rather easily distinguished.
Another species, which shows similarities to F. angusta obovata is F. minuta DRAGESCO,
1970. This species has symbiotic green algae and a conspicuously crescentic peniculus 3;
furthermore, it is considerably smaller (70 urn vs. 125 urn) and thus has fewer ciliary rows
(50-56 vs. 83-101; DRAGESCO 1970, DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1986).
The arrow-like resting extrusomes of F. angusta obovata are unique because those of the
congeners are simply fusiform (FOISSNER 1987b, FOISSNER et al. 1994, KRÜGER 1936).
However, this difference must not be over-interpreted because such details frequently have
not been studied thoroughly. Similarly, the silverline pattern is highly dependent on the
method used and the quality of the preparation. The pattern of F. angusta obovata is similar
to that of -> F. angusta solea as described by FOISSNER (1987b; Fig. 117f). Other authors
obviously could not impregnate the longitudinal silverline connecting the kinetids but only
the silverlines in the cortical ridges (e.g. ROQUE 1961a, DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS
1986); thus, the kinetids are in the centre of the meshes.
Frontonia terricola FOISSNER, 1987b (Fig. 116c, d; 367a-c, 370a-d; Tables 95,
100)
The Namibian specimens of Frontonia terricola match the Austrian populations in most
respects, especially the disproportionally large oral apparatus (Fig. 370a, c). But the number
of vestibular kineties is different: three in the Austrian populations, four in the Namibian
specimens. However, this difference must not be over-interpreted because the vestibular
kineties of F. terricola are comparatively inconspicuous and very close together. Thus, their
number is difficult to ascertain and subject to various interpretations. The point is that, in F.
terricola, vestibular kineties 2-4 are gradually shortened anteriorly - an unusual pattern
found in both the Austrian type specimens and the Namibian population, where it is also
clearly recognizable in SEM micrographs (Fig. 116c; 370a-d). Furthermore, the Namibian
population differs from the Austrian type population in the number of distinct kineties
composing peniculus 3 (invariably 2 vs. 3); however, there are one or two very short rows left
of the distinct ones in the Namibian specimens. The SEM investigation of a few well-
preserved and/or deciliated specimens showed and/or confirmed some further details: (i) the
cilia of the vestibular kineties are distinctly shorter than those of the peniculi and the ordinary
somatic kinetids; (ii) the paroral dikinetids and the first vestibular kinety form three distinct
rows of basal bodies at the right oral margin, where the oral ribs produce a ladder-like
structure; (iii) minute tubercles (basal bodies?) are right of the peniculi, whose basal bodies
517

are highly ordered; (iv) peniculi 1 and 2 extend side by side close together and are widely
separate from the ends of the distinctly curved peniculus 3; (v) peniculus 3 consists of a right
row of long cilia and a left row of short cilia (Fig. 370b, c). Likewise, the other peniculi
obviously do not have all rows ciliated, at least not with long cilia.

Apocyclidium nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Cyclidiidae, as defined by PUYTORAC (1994), with a secondary silverline
meridian between each two continuous ciliary rows (primary meridians).
Type species: Cyclidium obliquum KAHL, 1926.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the generic name
Cyclidium.
518

Comparison with related genera: In vivo, Apocyclidium obliquum is distin-
guished from Cyclidium only by the twisted ciliary rows; a feature too weak for establishing a
distinct genus (KAHL 1926, 1931b). However, KLEIN-FOISSNER silver nitrate impregnation
reveals a further conspicuous difference, viz., the silverline pattern. Cyclidium species,
including the type C. glaucoma, have only primary silverline meridians connecting the
kinetids of each kinety (CZAPIK 1963, FOISSNER et al. 1994, KLEIN 1926, POMP & WILBERT
1988, WILBERT 1986), while Apocyclidium additionally has a secondary meridian between
each two primary meridians (Fig. 119j, k; 371d-f, i-n). In this respect, A. obliquum differs
also from most (all?) other pleuronematid and philasterid genera (Fig. 37 lg, h; CZAPIK &
WILBERT 1986, FOISSNER & WILBERT 1981, FOISSNER et al. 1982, 1994, PEREZ-UZ & SONG
1995, PUYTORAC et al. 1974, SONG 1991, SONG & WILBERT 2000, THOMPSON & EVANS 1968,
WILBERT 1986, WILBERT & FOISSNER 1980). However, a similar pattern is found in many
tetrahymenid ciliates, for instance, Dexiostoma campylum, Glaucoma scintillans, Colpidium
kleini, and some populations of Tetrahymena pyriformis (FOISSNER et al. 1994, GELEI &
HORVÄTH 1931). The indirect-connecting silverline system of A. obliquum forms a mesh
around each kinetid, as in many other scuticociliates (FOISSNER et al. 1994, WILBERT &
BUITKAMP 1973, WILBERT & FOISSNER 1980).
In Apocyclidium obliquum, extrusomes occur not only within the ciliary rows, as in Cyclidium
glaucoma (BARDELE 1983), but also in a row each between the kineties. Apparently, the
occurrence of extrusomes between the kineties is combined with the occurrence of secondary
silverline meridians or branches of primary meridians, as in Dexiostoma campylum,
Colpidium colpoda, and Colpidium kleini and several other tetrahymenids, such as Glaucoma
and Tetrahymena (FOISSNER et al. 1994).
The silverline pattern is not known for most of the following genera and thus cannot be
compared with that of Apocyclidium. Fortunately, these genera differ from Apocyclidium by
other features (PUYTORAC 1994). Paracyclidium GROLIERE et al., 1980, Isocyclidium
ESTEBAN et al., 1993, and Paurotricha DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KJERNEIS, 1991 are distin-
guished from Apocyclidium mainly by the discontinuous ciliary rows leaving blank mid-body,
where a short, curved kinety extends horizontally in Paurotricha19. Pseudocyclidium SMALL
& LYNN, 1985 differs from Apocyclidium in the shape and arrangement of the adoral
membranelles: membranelies 1 and 2 each composed of two long ciliary rows extending
parallel to the paroral vs. Cyclidium pattern. Cristigera ROUX, 1899, as characterized by
FOISSNER et al. (1982), is distinguished from Apocyclidium not only by a different silverline
pattern (see above), but also by a conspicuous ventral furrow. Echinocyclidium JANKOWSKI in
SMALL & LYNN, 1985, as characterized by PUYTORAC (1994), differs from Apocyclidium
mainly by membraneile 1 comprising two short, posteriorly diverging ciliary rows and the
habitat, namely, the digestive tract of sea urchins. In —> Protocyclidium ALEKPEROV, 1993,
the adoral ciliature is not differentiated into distinct membranelles.
19 ESTEBAN & OLMO (1997) synonymize Paurotricha cyclidiformis with Cristigera pleuronemoides, although
the latter lacks the short, transverse kinety on the right side of cell, emphasized by DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-
KERNEIS (1991) in the diagnosis of Paurotricha.

Neotype material: Neotypified from Namibian site (37) population, according to
reasons 1, 3, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 30-35 x 15-20 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. Usually 2
macronuclear nodules. Contractile vacuole terminal, excretory pore underneath kineties 1 and
2. Extrusomes about 2.5 urn long, curved rods. 8 sinistrally twisted ciliary rows composed of
monokinetids and 1-3 dikinetids anteriorly. Oral apparatus occupies anterior ventral body
half. Adoral membranelles at right connected by a row of basal bodies, membranelle 1
rhomboid, membranelles 2 and 3 rectangular.
Redescription: Several populations of this species have been investigated (see "occur-
rence and ecology"). They match the original description in most features, especially the
twisted ciliary rows. The improved diagnosis and the redescription are based on the original
description and the Namibian site (37) population.
Size in vivo 35 urn in German type (KAHL 1926) and 20-30 x 8-15 um in Namibian neotype
population, 35—45 urn according to first redescription (KAHL 1931b). Shape ellipsoidal to
slightly ovoidal in lateral view, ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal in ventral and dorsal view
because slightly (Italian specimens) to up to 2:1 (Namibian and Saudi Arabian specimens)
laterally flattened. Anterior end with inconspicuous frontal plate, posterior broadly to
narrowly rounded, never indented at caudal cilium (Fig. 119a, b, d-g; 372a, c, g-i; Table
101). Nuclear apparatus in anterior two thirds of cell. Usually, two abutting macronuclear
nodules each about 2.5 urn across (93% of specimens, n = 200); in 6% of specimens one
macronuclear nodule about 4 urn across; and in 1% three abutting nodules each about 2 urn
across. Nucleoli apparently only in periphery of nodules and lobate. Micronuclei in indenta-
tions of macronuclear nodules, about 1 urn across and only occasionally impregnated; thus,
their number (up to 3?) is difficult to ascertain. Contractile vacuole subterminal in German,
invariably terminal and slightly shifted to ventral side in Namibian, Italian, and Saudi Arabian
specimens, surrounded by contributory vesicles during diastole. Excretory pore underneath
and between kineties 1 and 2 right of oral apparatus; distinct only in some properly orientated
silver carbonate and KLEIN-FOISSNER silver nitrate-impregnated cells (Fig. 119a, b, j; 371i, p,
r, 372a, e, g). Cytopyge slit extends between scutica and posterior fifth of cell. Cortex
distinctly ribbed right of ciliary rows. Extrusomes (mucocysts?) about 2.5 urn long and
slightly curved in vivo, appear as bright dots in surface view, form conspicuous fringe,
usually obliquely attached to cortex between each two kinetids of a kinety and in a longitudi-
nal, anteriorly slightly shortened row between kineties; not protruding from body proper in
European populations, but slightly so in Namibian and distinctly so in Saudi Arabian
specimens, where they form bundles and give cells a spiny appearance (Fig. 119a, b; 372b, e,
f, i). Attachment sites well-impregnated in CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate preparations,
producing a distinct pattern totally different from that of related genera, especially Cyclidium,

where they occur exclusively within the ciliary rows (Fig. 119i; BARDELE 1983, DlDlER &
WILBERT 1981, FOISSNER et al. 1994, POMP & WILBERT 1988, WILBERT 1986). Cytoplasm
colourless, contains some food vacuoles 2-3 urn across with remnants of bacteria. Moves like
Cyclidium glaucoma (TAMAR 1979), that is, jumps hastily to and fro interrupted by short
rests; when resting and feeding, somatic cilia somewhat disorderly spread and paroral spread
to a conspicuous velum.
Somatic cilia in vivo about 10 urn long in German and 8 urn in Namibian population, rather
stiff, single, except for (i) three pairs at anterior end of ciliary row left of oral opening; (ii)
one pair at anterior end of ciliary row right of oral opening; and (iii) two pairs each at anterior
end of other ciliary rows. Kinetids equidistantly arranged, that is, not locally condensed as in
some other species (FOISSNER 1995, 1996a). All ciliary rows of almost body length leaving
blank frontal plate and posterior pole area, equidistant and uniquely sinistrally twisted.
Spiralling very conspicuous in vivo, less so in silver preparations (Fig. 119b, d-g, i-m; 371b,
j-1, q, 372a, f-h; Table 101). Caudal cilium conspicuous because about 15 urn long in vivo,
slightly inclined to dorsal side; proximal portion of ordinary thickness, distal very fine and
straight. Scutica underneath oral apparatus, arranged in two short, converging rows on both
sides of cytopyge; right row usually composed of two kinetids, left of three. Silver carbonate
preparations reveal each kinetid to be composed of an irregular granule (mono- or dikinetid
plus parasomal sac) and a short structure (kinetodesmal fibre?) extending almost parallel to
kinety axis anteriad at right side of kinetid; scutica apparently without parasomal sac and
fibrillar (?) associates, lighter impregnated than ordinary kinetids, probably because uncili-
ated as is usual (Fig. 371a-c, p-r).
Oral apparatus extends from frontal plate to mid-body (Table 101), mid-portion covered by a
very hyaline cortical process (seen only in Saudi Arabian specimens but likely present also in
the other populations). Adoral membranelles (oral polykinetids) distinct in vivo, details
difficult to recognize due to their small size, at right connected by a row of (ciliated?) basal
bodies (Fig. 119h, 1; 371c, p). Membranelle 1 left of anterior end of paroral, rhomboid.
Membranelles 2 and 3 roughly rectangular and more or less horizontally orientated; both
apparently composed of about five aligned basal bodies in CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate
preparations, while apparently composed of more than one ciliary row in protargol, silver
carbonate, and KLEIN-FOISSNER silver nitrate preparations. Paroral membrane L-shaped,
entirely composed of zigzagging basal bodies as recognizable in properly orientated and
impregnated cells, that is, not single-rowed in anterior portion, as in Cyclidium glaucoma and
probably C. plouneouri (Fig. 119 1; 371c; FOISSNER 1996a, WILBERT 1986).
Silverline system best revealed by KLEIN-FOISSNER silver nitrate impregnation, basically as in
Cyclidium glaucoma (FOISSNER 1996a), that is, composed of primary meridians connecting
the kinetids and some transverse commissures anteriorly and posteriorly; furthermore, an
indirect-connecting system, which rarely impregnates, forms a mesh around each kinetid.
Apocyclidium obliquum is unique in having a secondary silverline meridian between each two
primary meridians (ciliary rows). Secondary meridians curve right to meet primary meridians
between second and third or third and fourth kinetid anteriorly and underneath last kinetid
posteriorly; usually contain some granules, very likely attachment sites of extrusomes (Fig.
A few divisional stages were found in the preparations; they resemble those of Cyclidium
bonneti (Fig. 37 lo; GROLIERE 1980).

Occurrence and ecology: KAHL (1926, 1931b) discovered A obliquum in freshwater
mud, probably in the surroundings of Hamburg, Germany. We found it at several sites in
Namibia (8, 16, 28, 37, 48), Saudi Arabia, and Italy. The Namibian samples were slightly to
highly saline soil and bark from a succulent Vitaceae. The sample from the Al-Hassa Oasis in
Saudi Arabia (25°30'N 49°40'E) was a mixture of litter (mainly from legumes planted for
desalinization) and highly saline (8%o), slightly acidic (pH 6.0), yellowish sand with many
roots and patches of iron concretions. The second Saudi Arabian sample was collected in an
irrigated grove of date-palms near the centre of the ancient town of Riyadh (24°N 46°E). It
consisted of litter and yellow-brown, slightly acidic (pH 6.2), saline sand with some grass
roots. The sample taken from the littoral of a lagoon near Venice, Italy (45°N 12°E) was a
mixture of slightly saline and alkaline-(pH 8.0) soil and roots from halophytes. Obviously, A.
obliquum is a cosmopolitan preferring saline habitats.
Comparison with original description and similar species: KAHL
(1926) described two Cyclidium species with twisted ciliary rows, namely, C. obliquum and
C. spirale (Fig. 119d, e). The descriptions were based on live observations. Later, KAHL
(1931b) synonymized C. spirale with C. obliquum assuming that the former was only a
modification with more distinctly twisted kineties (Fig. 119f, g). Our populations match C.
obliquum in this unique feature; thus, the few minor differences, such as body size (35-45 urn
vs. 20-30 urn) and location of the contractile vacuole (slightly subterminal vs. terminal) are
insufficient for separating the populations. The number of macronuclear nodules is difficult to
ascertain, especially in vivo, because they usually abut. Furthermore, this feature seems to be
highly variable in scuticociliates (Table 101).
According to FOISSNER (1998a), two Cyclidium and one —> Protocyclidium species have been
reported from soil and moss, namely, Cyclidium glaucoma, C. muscicola, and —>• Proto-
cyclidium terricola. In vivo, they can be easily distinguished from A. obliquum by the straight
523

course of the ciliary rows. Furthermore, C. glaucoma and A. obliquum have the contractile
vacuole in the posterior end (Fig. 119a, j; 371 i, p, r, 372a, e, g; FOISSNER 1996a), while it is
distinctly subterminal near the peristomial vertex in C. muscicola (FOISSNER 1995) and -> P.
terricola.
Protocyclidium ALEKPEROV, 1993
Improved diagnosis: Cyclidiidae, as defined by PUYTORAC (1994), with continuous
ciliary rows. Adoral membranelle 1 a patch of cilia, membranelles 2 and 3 hardly separated
from each other, forming a cuneate ciliary field composed of almost equidistant, horizontally
orientated rectangles (kineties) increasing in width from anterior to posterior.
Remarks: An improved diagnosis of Protocyclidium is necessary because ALEKPEROV
(1993) included several species-specific features, such as the number of ciliary rows and the
location of the macronucleus. The poorly described type species, P. terrenum, is very likely a
junior synonym of C. muscicola KAHL, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1995), because all main
features match. A literature search showed that at least four Cyclidium species should be
transferred to Protocyclidium because they have the same oral pattern: P. sphagnetorum
(SRÄMEK-HUSEK, 1949) nov. comb., as redescribed by GROLIERE (1973); P. citrullus (COHN,
1866) nov. comb., as redescribed by CZAPIK (1963), WILBERT (1995), and ESTEBAN et al.
(2000)20; —>• P. terricola (KAHL, 1931b) nov. comb., as redescribed below; and P. muscicola
(KAHL, 1931b) nov. comb., as redescribed by FOISSNER (1995). As concerns the last
mentioned species, we reinvestigated the type material and found scattered basal bodies
between membranelles 2 and 3, which are thus not as distinctly separate as illustrated by
FOISSNER (1995). This was confirmed by a study on another Austrian population (Fig. 373t,
u).
Comparison with related genera: In vivo, Protocyclidium is hardly distinguish-
able from other Cyclidiidae with continuous ciliary rows, while silver impregnation shows a
different oral pattern as diagnosed by ALEKPEROV (1993) and above (Fig. 120h, i, 1; 373g-j,
o, p, r). GROLIERE (1973), who investigated several such species, suggests that the posterior-
most rectangle of the cuneate field corresponds to adoral membranelle 3, while the other
rectangles between membranelles 1 and 3 correspond to membranelle 2. In the absence of
detailed ontogenetic data, we accept this interpretation. Protocyclidium has a Cyclidium-like
silverline pattern and thus lacks the secondary meridians characterizing -» Apocyclidium (Fig.
120h; 373m-q). Cristigera Roux, 1899, as characterized by FOISSNER et al. (1982), is
distinguished from Protocyclidium by the bipolar ventral furrow. Echinocyclidium
JANKOWSKI in SMALL & LYNN, 1985, as characterized by PUYTORAC (1994), differs from
Protocyclidium by the structure of adoral membranelles 1 and 2 and the habitat (digestive
tract of sea urchins vs. soil and soil mosses).
20 The recent redescription of C. citrullus by BUITKAMP (2000) from a freshwater habitat in Germany does not
match the redescriptions by CZAPIK (1963) and WILBERT (1995); likely, it is another species.

Protocyclidium terricola (KAHL, 1931) nov. comb. (Fig. 120a-p; 373a-s; Table
102)
Neotype material: Neotypified from a meadow soil population of Salzburg, Austria
(48°N 13°E), according to reasons 1, 2, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 35 x 18 urn in vivo; broadly ellipsoidal to slightly
ovoidal. Contractile vacuole distinctly subterminal, excretory pore usually near posterior
quarter of cell left of kinety 2. Extrusomes about 4 urn long and cuneate. Usually 12-14
ciliary rows composed of dikinetids in anterior body half and monokinetids in posterior. Oral
apparatus occupies about 50% of body length. Adoral membranelle 1 rhomboid, cuneate
membranellar field composed of 8 rectangles.
Description of Austrian neotype population: Size in vivo 30-40 urn in
German type and 28-35 x 15-20 urn in Austrian neotype population. In lateral view broadly
ellipsoidal to slightly ovoidal, dorsal side convex, ventral slightly flattened and without
longitudinal groove; elongate ellipsoidal in ventral and dorsal view because laterally flattened
up to 2:1 in vivo, less so in CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate preparations (Table 102). Anterior
end with rather distinct, circular to elliptical frontal plate, posterior widely rounded or slightly
truncate, never indented at caudal cilium (Fig. 120a, h-j, k, m-p; 373a-d). Macronucleus in
anterior half of cell, about 7 urn across in vivo; nucleoli very small and globular. Micro-
nucleus usually adjacent to anterior end of macronucleus, globular. Contractile vacuole
distinctly subterminal underneath and right of peristomial vertex, small, surrounded by
contributory vesicles during diastole; excretory pore slightly underneath posterior quarter of
cell at left end of posteriorly shortened kinety 2. Cytopyge slit extends between scutica and
posterior fifth of cell. Extrusomes (mucocysts?) of Austrian specimens hardly recognizable in
vivo because of similar light refraction as cytoplasm, while conspicuous in German,
Namibian, and Costa Rican specimens, where they appear as bright dots in surface view and
form a distinct fringe; 4-5 x 0.4-0.5 urn and cuneate with thicker end attached to cortex
between each two kinetids slightly left of ciliary rows, rarely between kineties and in
peristomial area; attachment sites usually impregnate in CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate
preparations, while organelles only rarely do so (Fig. 120d-f, h, i; 373e-j, s). Cytoplasm
colourless, packed with 1 urn-sized granules and some food vacuoles 5-7 urn across partially
containing a compact mass, likely bacterial remnants; Namibian site (66) specimens ingest
also small green algae. Jumps inconspicuously, compared to Cyclidium glaucoma, but swims
rapidly in Austrian population, and crawls jerkily in German; cilia and paroral membrane
spread when resting and feeding.
Somatic cilia long compared to size of cell, namely, about 13 urn in vivo, stiff, paired in
anterior body half, single in posterior; proximal portion of ordinary thickness, distal thin.
Distances between individual kinetids increases slightly from anterior to posterior, no local
cilia condensations as in some other species and Costa Rican specimens (see below). Ciliary
rows meridionally and equidistantly arranged, of almost body length, leave frontal plate and
posterior pole area blank; second kinety usually shortened by two to three kinetids and thus
terminating near posterior quarter of cell at excretory pore, last kinety shortened by one
kinetid each anteriorly and posteriorly. Caudal cilium inconspicuous because only about 20 urn

long in vivo, extends parallel to main body axis, proximal portion of ordinary thickness, distal
very fine; easily shed. Scutica underneath oral apparatus on both sides of cytopyge, usually
lighter impregnated than ordinary somatic and oral kinetids, probably because unciliated as is
usual; left portion probably composed of three or four basal bodies forming an oblique row,
right likely comprises one to three basal bodies (Fig. 120h-j, m-p; 373a, g, h, k-o, s).
Oral apparatus extends to second fifth of cell in German type and to third fifth in Austrian
neotype population (Table 102). Adoral ciliature rather conspicuous because composed of a
series of nine groups of strongly impregnated basal bodies forming a peculiar pattern, viz., an
upside down exclamation mark; details of individual groups difficult to recognize due to their
small size (Fig. 120h, i, 1; 373g-j, o, p, r). Membranelle 1 left and slightly underneath distal

in width from anterior to posterior. Rectangles apparently composed of one row of basal
bodies each, except for the two posteriormost, each likely consisting of two rows.
Membranelle 2 comprises seven rectangles, of which the anteriormost is adjacent to right side
of membraneile 1. Membranelle 3 comprises one rectangle connected at right with membra-
nelle 2 by two (?) more or less obliquely arranged basal bodies. Paroral membrane L-shaped,
entirely composed of zigzagging basal bodies, as recognizable in properly orientated and
impregnated cells, that is, not single-rowed in anterior portion, as in C. glaucoma and
probably C. plouneouri (FOISSNER 1996a, WlLBERT 1986); proximal portion associated with
distinct oral ribs extending radially to the cytostome.
Silverline system best revealed by KLEIN-FOISSNER silver nitrate impregnation, as in
Cyclidium glaucoma, that is, composed of primary meridians connecting the kinetids of a
ciliary row and some transverse commissures connecting kineties; furthermore, an indirect-
connecting system, which rarely impregnates, forms a mesh around each kinetid (Fig. 120b, c,
h; 373 1-q).
Other populations: The Namibian population matches the type and neotype population
in most morphometrics (Table 102). It differs, however, in body shape because it is postorally
slightly narrowed making cells obovoidal (Fig. 120k, m; 373a-d). Furthermore, the Namibian
specimens are more slender (length:width ratio 2.5:1 vs. 2:1 in ventral and 1.9:1 vs. 1.7:1 in
lateral view) and usually slightly longer (33 urn vs. 29 urn long on average; Table 102) than
the Austrian ones. The extrusomes are often clustered and form a distinct fringe and rather
conspicuous tubercles recognizable even at low (xl50) magnification on the cell surface (Fig.
120d-f, k; 373e, f). The last somatic ciliary row is not only shortened by one kinetid
posteriorly, as in the Austrian population, but terminates at the level of the peristomial vertex.
Additionally, the oral apparatus is larger than in the Austrian specimens (usually terminating
58% vs. 66% back from anterior body end), the adoral membranelles are more posteriorly
located (distance to anterior body end 6.7 urn vs. 3.5 urn), the paroral membrane often forms
a small hook distally, and jumping is more pronounced.
The Costa Rican specimens have a similar body shape to the Namibian ones. The excretory
pore is even more subterminal (70% back from anterior body end) than in the Austrian (77%)
and Namibian (73%) cells and not at end of kinety 2, which is usually shortened by only one
kinetid, but between its ultimate and penultimate kinetid (Fig. 373g-l, s). Furthermore, kinety
1 often has about five slightly condensed kinetids anteriorly. The last of the 12-16 (x = 14, n
= 6) ciliary rows usually commences not near the distal end of the paroral but at level of
adoral membranelle 1 and is shortened by one kinetid posteriorly, as in the Austrian speci-
mens.
Occurrence and ecology: KAHL (1931 b) discovered P. terricola in soil mosses from
the surroundings of Hamburg in northern Germany, as well as in alpine mosses from southern
Germany. FOISSNER (1998a) recorded it from the Holarctic, Palaeotropical, and Australian
regions. The Austrian neotype population is from a meadow in the town of Salzburg. The
Namibian population was found at site (66), namely, in mud taken from rock-pools in the
dolomite hills at the south margin of the Etosha Pan. In Costa Rica, P. terricola occurred in
mud from rock-pools at the bank of the Rio Corobici, Central America (10°28'N 85°10'W). A
further population was found in red soil from Alice Springs, Australia (24°S 133°E). In
Namibia and Costa Rica, P. terricola was associated with -» Wolfkosia loeffleri. Generally,
P. terricola is a common species in a wide variety of terrestrial habitats, possibly preferring
nutrient-rich soils.
529

Comparison with original description and related species: The original
description of C. terricola is rather incomplete and confusing because KAHL (1931b)
mentions features in the key that are not shown in the illustration, especially the caudal
cilium, which is, indeed, not very pronounced in this species (Fig. 120a, g). Another
difference, namely, the size of the oral apparatus (40% vs. 60% of body length), could
indicate that we are dealing with different species. However, in over 1000 moss and soil
samples we found only four Cyclidium s.l. species, viz., Protocyclidium muscicola (most
common), Cyclidium glaucoma (very infrequent), —» Apocyclidium obliquum (mainly in
saline soils), and populations like those described here. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that
our populations are conspecific with the forgotten C. terricola KAHL, 1931b. Generally, this
species shows a rather high interpopulation variability (see above), especially in the
distinctness and arrangement of the extrusomes, the body shape, the length of the second and
last ciliary row, and the occurrence of condensed cilia in the anterior portion of kinety 1. This
might indicate that it is a sibling species complex (see also next paragraph).
Protocyclidium terricola highly resembles P. muscicola, as redescribed by FOISSNER (1995),
especially in the subterminal location of the contractile vacuole. When the following data are
taken into account, even main morphometrics overlap slightly. The P. muscicola specimens
from Namibian site (66) are larger than those from Austria (CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate
preparation: 18-25 urn vs. 13-17 urn) and are thus rather difficult to separate from small
individuals of P. terricola (CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate preparation: 26—31 urn in Austrian
and 29-39 urn in Namibian population). However, they are usually distinguishable by body
size (CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate preparation: 15 urn in Austrian and 22 urn in Namibian
specimens vs. 28 urn in Austrian and 33 urn in Namibian specimens) and number of ciliary
rows (9-10 vs. 12-16).
Protocyclidium sphagnetorum (SRAMEK-HUSEK, 1949) is distinguished from P. terricola
mainly by the zoochlorellae (present vs. absent). The location of the excretory pore is similar
in both species, namely underneath the level of the peristomial vertex near the end of the
posteriorly shortened kinety 2 (STRÜDER 1991, WILBERT 1986). Thus, GROLIERE (1973)
obviously misinterpreted an extrusome attachment site within the peristomial area as
excretory pore. Protocyclidium citrullus (COHN, 1866) has the same adoral pattern as P.
terricola because CZAPIK (1963) obviously misinterpreted the left margin of the cytostome as
membranelle 3. This is substantiated by the observations of WILBERT (1995) and ESTEBAN et
al. (2000). According to these redescriptions and KAHL (1931b), P. citrullus and P. terricola
differ in the number of ciliary rows (14—16 vs. 10-15), the location of the contractile vacuole
(terminal vs. distinctly subterminal), and the indentation containing the caudal cilium
complex (present vs. lacking).
Pseudocohnilembus binucleatus nov. spec. (Fig. 121a-h; Table 103)
Diagnosis: Size about 30 x 15 urn in vivo; lanceolate. 2 macronuclear nodules and 7
somatic kineties. Excretory pore of contractile vacuole at end of kinety 3.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E
(site 59 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).

531

Etymology: The Latin binucleatus (two nuclei) refers to the main feature of the species,
that is, the two macronuclear nodules.
Description: Size 20-40 x 10-20 urn in vivo. Shape lanceolate to ovate, length:width
ratio 1.7-2.6:1, on average 2:1; unflattened. Macronuclear nodules in middle third of cell,
slightly ellipsoidal, nuclear membrane more or less distinctly separate from chromatin in
prepared specimens (Fig. 121e, f). Of 122 specimens investigated, 2 have one macronucleus,
118 have two nuclei, 1 has three nuclei, and 1 even has four. Very likely amicronucleate
because micronuclei recognizable neither in morphostatic nor dividing specimens (Fig. 121 f—
h). Contractile vacuole in rear end, excretory pore at end of kinety 3 (Fig. 121a, b). Cortex
bright, flexible. No extrusomes recognizable. Feeds on bacteria. Swims rather rapidly by
rotation about main body axis.
Somatic cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, invariably arranged in 7 slightly spiralling rows,
distances between kinetids increase slightly from anterior to posterior. All kineties composed
of dikinetids, except near posterior end, where some monokinetids occur; furthermore, some
posterior dikinetids have only the posterior basal body ciliated. Caudal cilium in centre of
posterior pole, about as long as cell (Fig. 121a-c).
Oral apparatus as in other members of genus (FOISSNER et al. 1994, POMP & WILBERT 1988),
extends to mid-body. Buccal field triangular and very flat. Cilia of adoral membranelles and
paroral membrane about 8 urn long, decrease in length proximally, form conspicuous velum
in vivo. Adoral membraneile 2 slightly thickened anteriorly, membraneile 3 at proximal end
of membraneile 2, rectangular, minute. Scutica at buccal vertex, usually recognizable only in
early dividers (Fig. 121a, b, d).

532

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at margin of Etosha Pan (site 59).
Obviously euryhaline, as are all other species of the genus.
Comparison with related species: All congeners have a single macronucleus (for
reviews, see FERNANDEZ-LEBORANS & NOVILLO 1994, FOISSNER & WILBERT 1981, FOISSNER
et al. 1994), distinctly setting off the binucleate Namibian population; very rarely specimens
occur with 1, 3 or 4 nuclei (Table 103). Both nuclei divide and are thus not a certain stage of
the life cycle (Fig. 121f-h). Two macronuclear nodules are unusual for this kind of scutico-
ciliates. However, SONG (1993) described a similar exception in the genus Homalogastra.
A second feature separating P. binucleatus from all described species (but see —» P.
persalinus hexakineta, described below) is the possession of only 7 ciliary rows, while the
other species have 8-14. However, the number of ciliary rows is not entirely constant in
different populations of the same species and must thus be used cautiously (FOISSNER et al.
1994, THOMPSON 1965).
Recently, we studied a Pseudocohnilembus from a saline soil in the USA. It has 6-8 (x = 7)
ciliary rows and one (57%) or two (43%) macronuclei, casting doubts on the species status of
the Namibian population.
Pseudocohnilembus persalinus hexakineta nov. sspec. (Fig. 122a—i; Table 104)
Diagnosis: Pseudocohnilembus persalinus with 6 or 7 ciliary rows, depending on
population.
Type location: Sedge girdle at margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E (site 61
in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Greek apposition composed of hexa (six) and kinetes (~ ciliary row),
referring to the main feature of the subspecies, viz., six ciliary rows.
Description and comparison with literature data and related
species (for literature, see FERNANDEZ-LEBORANS & NOVILLO 1994, FOISSNER & WILBERT
1981, and SONG 2000): SONG (2000) considerably amended and excellently reviewed the data
available on various P. persalinus populations and concluded: "(i) the structure of the buccal
apparatus of all Pseudocohnilembus species is extremely similar; (ii) many diagnostic
characters (e.g. body-size, number and position of contractile vacuole pores) appear to be
population-dependent and overlap among species; and (iii) most species have been described
from silver-impregnated specimens with little information about the living morphology". We
fully agree with SONG'S conclusions and would like to supplement them with a fourth one,
viz., that the fine details of the oral structures and silverline pattern are highly dependent on
the quality of the preparations and the methods used.
SONG (2000) suggests P. marinus and P. longisetus as junior synonyms of P. persalinus,
while FOISSNER & WILBERT (1981) synonymize P. persalinus and P. longisetus with P.
pusillus. Although we still hold this view, we follow SONG (2000) at the present state of
knowledge.

Most Namibian Pseudocohnilembus populations are unique in having only six or seven ciliary
rows, even the new species -» P. binucleatus; typical P. persalinus populations with eight or
nine kineties occur only at sites (31, 32). We separate the six and seven-rowed Namibian
populations at subspecies level because all described Pseudocohnilembus species (about 10)
and populations (about 20) have eight or more ciliary rows. All other features are highly
similar to P. persalinus, as described by EVANS & THOMPSON (1964) and redescribed by
534

SONG (2000). The populations from sites (39) and (61) are ovoidal and thus look like a
Cyclidium (Fig. 122a, c-g), while the large cells from site (14) are lanceolate and thus look
like a typical Pseudocohnilembus (Fig. 122b, h, i), but have distinctly spiralled kineties.
However, the site (14) population also contains small individuals very similar to those from
sites (39) and (61), that is, with straight or only slightly spiralled ciliary rows; possibly, the
large cells are some sort of giants, although the oral apparatus is not enlarged (Table 104).
Occurrence and ecology: This species was found at thirteen sites (Table 4). All are
saline, most highly saline, showing that Pseudocohnilembus persalinus hexakineta is a
eurytopic and euryhaline species. It also confirms FOISSNER (1987d) that Pseudocohnilembus
spp. indicate soil salinity.

PROSTOMATIDA
Holophrya salinarum nov. spec. (Fig. 123a-f; Table 105)
Diagnosis: Size about 220 x 130 um in vivo; broadly ellipsoidal. On average 17 globular
macronuclear nodules forming a transverse ring in mid-body. Oral extrusomes rod-shaped
and approximately 35 x 0.5 urn in size, body extrusomes slightly fusiform and approximately
4 um long. About 250 somatic ciliary rows, 3 anteriorly differentiated to dorsal brush.
Type location: Highly saline pan soil from the Etosha National Park, Namibia, 18°55'S
16°25'E (site 65 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin plural noun salinarum (saline environments) refers to the saline
habitat the species was discovered.
Description: This conspicuous ciliate was very rare and thus the data are incomplete.
However, the main features were observed both in vivo and silver nitrate preparations and are
so distinct that it appears justified to describe the organism as a new species.
Size 160-270 x 100-150 urn in vivo, usually near 220 x 130 urn; length:width ratio on
average 1.6:1 both in vivo and silver nitrate preparations (Table 105). Shape broadly
ellipsoidal to ellipsoidal, slightly narrower anteriorly than posteriorly, that is, indistinctly
ovate; unflattened and acontractile (Fig. 123a). Cells brownish under low magnification (<
xlOO) and bright field illumination due to the large size and cytoplasmic inclusions, both
making specimens rather refractive and opaque. Macronucleus extraordinary, that is,
composed of an average of 17 globular nodules forming a transverse ring in or near mid-body
(Fig. 123a, c, f). Micronuclei not seen. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, about 15-30
excretory pores in posterior pole area. Two types of extrusomes (Fig. 123b-e): oral extru-
somes found only in pharyngeal basket, rod-shaped and slightly curved, about 35 x 0.5 urn in
size; body extrusomes indistinctly fusiform, approximately 4 urn long, scattered within and
among ciliary rows, as indicated by the silverline circles surrounding docked organelles.
Cortex thick and moderately flexible, indistinctly furrowed by ciliary rows, has attached
extrusomes as described above. Cytoplasm conspicuously vacuolated providing cells with a
foamy appearance, contains many concentrically laminated starch grains up to 35 urn across,
possibly from small seeds. Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia about 15 urn long in vivo, arranged in about 250 bipolar, very closely spaced (1.5-2
jim) and densely ciliated rows, anterior third of three rows differentiated to dorsal brush,
whose details are not recognizable in the silver preparations (Fig. 123f)-
Oral basket large, that is, occupies about one third of body diameter, projects distinctly from
body proper, composed of many fine rods forming rather distinct bundles; basket anteriorly
filled with extrusomes, as described above, and refractive granules producing a dark ribbon
under bright field illumination, similar to Homalozoon (Fig. 123a, f). Circumoral ciliature not
clearly recognizable in the silver nitrate preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at the highly saline type location, where
537

it was very rare. Holophrya species are rare in soil, likely due to their clumsy, rather
inflexible body (FoiSSNER 1998a). Actually, it is possible that H. salinarum is not a soil
inhabitant but a limnetic species optimally reproducing when the pan is flooded.
Classification and comparison with related species: Previously, species
like Holophrya salinarum were classified in Prorodon because most authors were unaware of
the type species fixed by FROMENTEL (1875). See FOISSNER et al. (1994) for a detailed
discussion. The Namibian population is classified in Holophrya because its general organiza-
tion matches typical members ofthat genus, such as H. ovum and H. teres (see FOISSNER et al.
1994 for a brief review on these species). Holophrya salinarum has two unique features, viz.,
the ring-like arranged macronuclear nodules and the long oral extrusomes, distinguishing it
from all congeners. Likewise, the high number of ciliary rows (about 250) is found only in
one other species, that is, H spirogyrophaga (LEIPE 1989) nov. comb, (basionym: Prorodon
spirogyrophagus LEIPE 1989), which has about 230 rows, scattered contractile vacuoles, and a
globular macronucleus. Thus, H. salinarum is a very distinct species easily to identify both in
vivo and in silver preparations.

Family Plagiocampidae KAHL, 1926
FOISSNER (1997b) and FOISSNER & PFISTER (1997) included Urotricha in the Plagiocampidae,
while SMALL & LYNN (1985) established a new family for Urotricha and some related genera
with features hardly justifying such a separation (paroral dikinetids as circle vs. semicircle).
However, our data from —> Plagiocampa pentadactyla now support a separation of Urotricha
and Plagiocampa at familial level because the cortical pattern is distinctly different from that
of Urotricha and highly reminiscent ofthat found in Holophrya (Fig. 124k). Thus, Plagio-
campa possibly belongs to the holophryids, although its general organisation is very much
like that of Urotricha.
Plagiocampa pentadactyla nov. spec. (Fig. 124a-l; 374a-e; Table 106)
Diagnosis: Size about 30 x 20 um in vivo; angular-ellipsoidal due to slight subapical
shoulder. Body extrusomes rod-shaped, about 2 urn long. 2 caudal cilia. On average 16
somatic kineties and 4-5 paroral dikinetids (oral flaps).
Type location: Field soil in the surroundings of the town of Cotonou, Benin, Africa,
06°N 02°30'E.
Etymology: The Greek pentadactyla (five-fingered) refers to the five, finger-like oral
flaps.
539

Description: We studied five populations of this species (see "occurrence and ecology").
They are very similar, in spite of the large geographical distances. Thus, the diagnosis and
description comprise all populations. Morphometric data, however, are kept separate (Table
106).
Size in vivo 25-40 x 15-25 urn (African populations) or 20-35 x 12-25 urn (Chinese and
Tenerife populations). Body shape highly characteristic, viz., slightly hexagonal due to a
more or less distinct subapical shoulder, usually slightly broadening posteriorly (type and
Chinese population, Fig. 124a, f) or anteriorly (South African specimens, Fig. 124g),
inconspicuously asymmetrical because laterally up to 1.5:1 flattened and dorsal side usually
more distinctly convex than ventral (Fig. 124a; Table 106). Macronucleus in or near body
centre, globular, contains small, pale nucleoli. Micronucleus not seen, not impregnated by
protargol. Contractile vacuole in posterior end, slightly eccentric, with single excretory pore
very near to caudal cilia (Fig. 124a, 1). Cortex about 0.8 urn thick, flexible, distinctly
furrowed by ciliary rows in anterior third, contains complicated alveolar pattern occasionally
recognizable in vivo and in protargol-impregnated specimens (Fig. 124k; 374c); has attached
minute (2-2.5 urn long), rod-shaped (Chinese population) to slightly cuneate (African
population) extrusomes mainly in anterior two thirds of cell (Fig. 124a, h; 374e); right side of
most populations densely covered with about 3 urn long, rod-shaped epipellicular bacteria,
many of which contain a bright spore (Fig. 124e; 374a, d, e). Usually rather dark at low (<
xlOO) magnification in posterior half due to many colourless, bright (refractive) lipid droplets
1-3 urn across. Food vacuoles mainly in anterior body half, 5-10 urn across, contain compact
material, likely remnants from protozoan prey. Most specimens from type and South African
population packed with, very likely parasitic, about 4 urn long bacteria having slightly
narrowed ends and bright, ellipsoidal spores (Fig. 124a, d; 374a). Swims rather rapidly by
rotation about main body axis jerkily changing direction, but does not jump.
Ordinary somatic cilia 6-7 urn (11 urn in South African specimens) long, arise from deep
cortical pits, slightly more closely spaced anteriorly than posteriorly. Caudal cilia about as
long as body, for instance, 35 urn in a Venezuelan specimen, and thus conspicuous, distal
third thread-like narrowed; very fragile and frequently shed when cells are immobilised by
cover glass pressure. Ciliary rows extend meridionally and equidistantly, commence at oral
opening with a pair of basal bodies, slightly shortened posteriorly leaving blank small pole
area, the centre of which invariably bears the two caudal cilia described above (Fig. 124a, f,
g,i,j,l;374b,d,e).
Oral opening in centre of anterior pole, rather conspicuous, although being only 2-3 urn
across, due to protruding oral flaps; dorsal half surrounded by five dikinetids (undulating
membrane) associated with about 3 urn long, paired flaps occasionally moving up and down
(Fig. 124a-c, f, g). Invariably three adoral organelles (brosse) side by side in minute grooves
at ventral half of oral opening; individual organelles minute, each consisting likely of three
dikinetids having 1-2 urn long cilia. Pharynx minute (about 2 x2 urn), pit-like, dorsally
longer than ventrally (Fig. 124a, b, i, j).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location (red, slightly saline soil with
much litter from fields in the surroundings of Cotonou; sample kindly provided by Prof. Dr.
Jean DRAGESCO, France, in June 1993), in the Republic of South Africa (Cape Peninsula,
Sirkelsvlei; soil sandy and with many grass roots, flooded during high water of small lake
nearby, pH 5.4; collected on 18.02.1995), in China (soil and mud from a by-pass stream near
540

the Wei Ming hotel in a suburb of Beijing; soil loamy, darkbrown, pH 6.7; collected on
24.06.1995), at Tenerife (south-east coast of Candelaria Island; lightgrey, non-saline soil with
some litter, pH 8.2; collected by Dr. Brigitte KRASSNIGG in 1988), in Saudi Arabia, in
Venezuela, and at four sites of Namibia (Table 4). These data indicate that P. pentadactyla is
cosmopolitan having a wide ecological range occurring in both true terrestrial and semi-
terrestrial habitats.

Comparison with related species: There are three other terrestrial Plagiocampa
species with two caudal cilia, namely, P. atra GRANDORI & GRANDORI, 1934, P. bitricha
FOISSNER, 1999b, and —> P. namibiensis. Plagiocampa atra is considerably larger than P.
pentadactyla (51 jam vs. 25-40 urn), much more slender (3.1:1 vs. 0.7:1), and has bright,
pearl-like mucocysts. —> Plagiocampa bitricha has a large oral opening surrounded by 14 oral
flaps (paroral dikinetids), which are 8 urn long and thus very conspicuous. —> Plagiocampa
namibiensis has three ciliary circlets and a large, unciliated posterior pole area. Further, the
somewhat hexagonal body outline and the epipellicular bacteria are highly characteristic for
P. pentadactyla because both were present in over 20 populations studied so far.

urn long. On average 13-14 somatic kineties with cilia arranged in three distinct circlets. 2
caudal cilia and 4 paroral dikinetids (oral flaps).

Description: We studied two populations of this species (see "occurrence and ecology").
They are very similar, as evident from the morphometric data (Table 107). Thus, the
diagnosis and description comprise both populations.
Size 17-27 x 12-18 urn in vivo, that is, very small and thus the two long caudal cilia become
especially prominent. Shape ovate to broadly fusiform, slightly asymmetrical because dorsal
side more distinctly convex than ventral; posterior end broadly rounded, anterior plug-like
narrowed due to projecting oral flaps (Fig. 125a, b). Macronucleus usually in posterior body
half, about 5 urn across in vivo, in protargol preparations frequently wrinkled, that is, poorly
preserved (Fig. 374i, j). Micronucleus attached or close to macronucleus, about 1 urn across.
Contractile vacuole subterminal with single, ventrolateral excretory pore mid-way posterior
cilia circlet and caudal cilia (Fig. 125h; 374 1). Somatic extrusomes attached to thin and
inconspicuous cortex, rod-shaped and minute, that is, only about 1 urn long and thus difficult
to recognize. Cytoplasm colourless, usually contains many lipid droplets 1-3 urn across,
mainly in mid-body. Food vacuoles with compact or loose content, possibly from protozoan
prey. Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis changing direction frequently by
small jumps.
Ordinary somatic cilia about 7 urn long; caudal cilia in centre of posterior pole and distinctly
apart from each other and ciliary rows, 20-25 urn long, that is, at least as long as body and
thus very prominent, distal third thread-like narrowed (Fig. 125a, b; 374f, g, h, j, 1). Ciliary
rows extend meridionally and equidistantly, commence at oral opening with a pair of basal
bodies each (anterior basal body unciliated and thus often faintly impregnated), posteriorly
shortened by about 35% (Table 107), leaving blank large pole area. Five to seven, usually six
cilia per row, form three distinct circlets: upper circlet composed of the three to five rather
closely spaced anterior cilia of each row, middle and posterior circlet formed by penultimate
and last cilium of each row (Fig. 125a, f, g; 374f-h, k, 1). Basal bodies with single parasomal
sac at right, connected by meridionally extending, slightly wrinkled silverlines forming wide-
meshed lattice in posterior pole area and connecting ciliary rows with caudal cilia and
excretory pore of contractile vacuole (Fig. 125h, i; 374 1).
Oral opening in centre of anterior pole, rather conspicuous, although being only 2-3 urn
across, due to the protruding oral flaps; dorsal half surrounded by four dikinetids (undulating
membrane; at right end frequently a single granule, likely an incomplete dikinetid) associated
with about 2 urn long, paired flaps occasionally moving up and down (Fig. 125a, c, e; 374g,
i). Invariably three adoral organelles (brosse) side by side at ventral half of oral opening;
individual organelles minute, each consisting of three (di?) kinetids having 1-2 urn long cilia;
proximal kinetid of organelles 1 and 2 very likely bare because frequently smaller and more
faintly impregnated than distal kinetids (Fig. 125e; 374i). Pharynx inconspicuous, obconical,
extends obliquely to dorsal side of cell, dorsal wall supported by nematodesmata originating
from paroral dikinetids and uniting subapically to extend as a single bundle into posterior half
of cell (Fig. 125a, g).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location (site 30) and in Benin (red,
slightly saline field soil with much litter from the surroundings of Cotonou; sample kindly
provided by Prof. Dr. Jean DRAGESCO, France, in June 1993), where it occurred together with
-> Plagiocampa pentadactyla. The occurrence in both undisturbed, humous soil from the
flooded margin of a pond and in red, slightly saline field soil indicates that P. namibiensis has
a wide ecological range.

Comparison with related species: Plagiocampa namibiensis is well-defined by
the minute size, the two conspicuous caudal cilia, and the three ciliary circlets. The large,
unciliated posterior pole area is highly reminiscent of the genus Urotricha.

Plagiocampa ovata GELEI, 1954 (Fig. 126a-c; Table 108)
This species was thoroughly redescribed and neotypified by FOISSNER (2000a), who also
discussed in detail the taxonomic problems. Thus, we provide only a brief account, empha-
sizing deviating features. Generally, the Namibian specimens are slightly larger than those
from Madeira and thus fit better to the Hungarian specimens of GELEI (1954). However,
basically the Namibian specimens match very well the Madeiran neotype population (Table
108), except in having not two but only one dikinetid at the anterior end of the ciliary rows.
This is a rather prominent difference which, however, must not be over-interpreted because
the second dikinetid is more variable than the first, that is, may have both basal bodies ciliated
545

or only the posterior one (FOISSNER 2000a, Fig. 53, 71). The lack of the second dikinetid
makes the Namibian specimens rather similar to P. bitricha FOISSNER, 1999b, except for the
number of caudal cilia: one in P. ovata, two in P. bitricha (Table 108).

Plagiocampides nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Plagiocampidae (?) with minute, polygonal cortical alveoli and wide-meshed
silverline pattern. Brosse (adoral organelles) minute, interrupts circumoral kinety (paroral
membrane) composed of dikinetids and oral flaps each containing an extrusome.
Type species: Plagiocampideshalophilus nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the generic name Plagiocampa and the Greek suffix ides
(similar), meaning a ciliate genus similar to Plagiocampa. Masculine gender.
Classification and comparison with related genera: This species is
difficult to classify. Originally, we identified it as Chilophrya utahensis (PACK, 1919) KAHL,
1930a because it matches that species in body size and shape, somatic ciliature, location of
the contractile vacuole, the extremely saline habitat, and feeding behaviour. However, the oral
structures do not match PACK'S description: "The cilia are distributed between ridges that run
parallel to the long axis of the body. These ridges project slightly beyond the opening of the
mouth (anterior end) and form finger-like projections. One of which is long and well
developed, being used to crowd food into the mouth. The oesophagus is short and fitted with
short rods that may be extended in the shape of a star" (Fig. 127a, b). If the "finger-like
projections" are interpreted as oral flaps and the "extending rods" as exploding extrusomes in
the flaps, the oral morphology would be similar to that of —» Plagiocampa. On the other hand,
547

VUXANOVICI (1961a) confirmed an important feature of PACK'S description, viz., the single
specialized oral process. Our populations definitely lack such a finger-like oral process and all
oral flaps are inconspicuous and thus identified as such only after thorough investigation of
live and silver-impregnated specimens; accordingly, a relationship to -> Plagiocampa is not
obvious. The inconspicuousness of the flaps is at least partially caused by the lack of the
beating movements so typical for the flaps of —> Plagiocampa and Chilophrya terricola
(FOISSNER 1984, FOISSNER et al. 1994, KAHL 1930a); furthermore, the flaps do not insert at
the outer margin of the oral opening but at the entrance to the oral funnel and disappear in
strongly squeezed specimens (Fig. 127 1).
The second feature which distinguishes our specimens from C. utahensis is the lack of
symbiotic algae. However, the evidences provided by PACK (1919) for symbiotic algae in C.
utahensis are not convincing.
Unfortunately, details of the somatic and oral ciliary pattern of Chilophrya are unknown,
although FOISSNER (1984) studied carefully a C. terricola. However, the generic classification
of this species is doubtful because it lacks, like Plagiocampides halophilus, the main generic
feature, viz., a lip-like cortical structure covering one side of the oral opening (KAHL 1930a).
Plagiocampides halophilus is undoubtedly someway related to the -» Plagiocampidae
because (i) the oral ciliature consists of paroral dikinetids forming a ring interrupted by the
adoral organelles; (ii) the ciliary rows leave blank only a small posterior pole area; and (iii)
the cirrus-like oral projections each contain an extrusome (Fig. 127m; 375d; FOISSNER et al.
1994, 1999). However, the cortex and silverline pattern are different from those of Plagio-
campa (—> P. pentadactyla) and Urotricha (FOISSNER et al. 1999), but resemble Holophrya
ovum, which, however, has a different oral ciliature (for a brief review, see FOISSNER et al.
1994). Accordingly, Plagiocampides might even be the representative of a new family.
Plagiocampides halophilus nov. spec. (Fig. 127a-q; 375a-n; Table 109)
Diagnosis: Size about 40 x 17 urn in vivo; ovoidal. Macro- and micronucleus globular.
On average 13 slightly dextrally twisted ciliary rows, 10 paroral dikinetids, and 3 quadrangu-
lar adoral organelles.
Type location: Cyanobacterial crusts from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°10'S
15°55'E (site 58 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words halo (salt) and philus (loving), meaning a salt-
loving Plagiocampides.
Description: Size 35-45 x 15-20 urn, usually about 40 x 17 urn in vivo. Length:width
ratio 2-3:1 in vivo and 1.7-2.6:1 in protargol preparations, while 1.5-1.9:1 in CHATTON-
LWOFF silver nitrate slides, where cells are distinctly broader (Table 109). Shape rather
constant in vivo, that is, ovoidal to elongate ovoidal and slightly asymmetrical because dorsal
side more distinctly convex than ventral; anterior end narrowly, posterior broadly rounded;
usually ellipsoidal and with depressed pole area in CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate and
protargol preparations (Fig. 127a, h, i, m; 375a, b). Macronucleus usually in middle third of
cell, broadly ellipsoidal, surrounded by distinct membrane, contains some lobate nucleoli; in

two out of 75 specimens investigated two globular macronuclear nodules, in one cell four,
and in one even sixteen beads. Micronucleus adjacent to macronucleus, globular, often not
recognizable due to similarly sized cytoplasmic inclusions. Contractile vacuole terminal, two
to four, usually three excretory pores in pole centre. Cytopyge extends longitudinally in
posterior quarter of right side, faintly impregnated. Cortex about 0.7 urn thick, distinctly
notched likely by ciliary pits, lacks extrusomes; forms distinct rib right of ciliary rows and
contains narrow, irregular meshes recognizable both in vivo and after silver carbonate and
protargol impregnation, where they are occasionally negatively stained (Fig. 127f; 375j-n).
Silverline pattern widely and rather regularly meshed in CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate
preparations (Fig. 127e). No extrusomes recognizable in vivo, but minute black rods became
evident after silver impregnation in the cytoplasm and distal half of the oral flaps (Fig. 127 1,
375d), just as in —> Plagiocampa and Balanion, in which the rods were proved to be toxicysts
550

(BARDELE 1999, FAURE-FREMIET & ANDRE 1965, FOISSNER 1984). Cytoplasm colourless,
contains many fat globules 2—4 urn across and some optically almost empty food vacuoles
about 5 urn across. Feeds mainly on ciliates, even cannibalistic, rarely on filamentous
cyanobacteria; when engulfing the prey, the oral opening widens up to body diameter (Fig.
127n). Swims moderately rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Ordinary somatic cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, originate from distinct pits; distances
between individual cilia increase slightly from anterior to posterior; no caudal cilia. On
average 13 equidistant ciliary rows, which commence directly underneath paroral dikinetids
and adoral organelles and extend slightly dextrally twisted to near body end, where they leave
blank a small pole area containing the excretory pores of the contractile vacuole; mono-
kinetidal, except for one (perioral) dikinetid with two about 3 urn long cilia at anterior end of
kineties. Kinetids usually composed of a small, ciliated granule having attached a large, bare
granule (probably a parasomal sac) at right anterior margin in CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate
preparations; occasionally another large, bare granule occurs at left posterior margin of basal
body; in silver carbonate preparations, kinetids are associated with a short (kinetodesmal?)
fibre extending almost parallel to kinety axis anteriad at right side of basal body (Fig. 127h-k,
o, p; 375c; Table 109).
Oral opening occupies central anterior pole area, almost entirely surrounded by 9-11 paroral
dikinetids each associated with a 6 um long, cirrus-like projection (oral flap) containing an
extrusome, as described above; flaps almost immobile and thus dissimilar to those of the
Plagiocampidae, disappear in strongly squeezed specimens. Paroral dikinetids (paroral
membrane) orientated perpendicularly to main kinety axis, lighter impregnated than ordinary
and adoral kinetids, difficult to recognize because at entrance of oral funnel (Fig. 127a, j, 1, m,
q; 375a, b, d-i). Invariably three slightly staggering adoral organelles (brosse) in shallow
groove at top of three ventral ciliary rows, orientated parallel or slightly obliquely to main
body axis, interrupt paroral membrane; individual organelles minute, that is, likely composed
of two short kineties each with up to four basal bodies bearing 1 (am long cilia. Pharyngeal
basket composed of fine fibres originating from paroral dikinetids and hardly recognizable in
vivo, but distinct in protargol preparations; basket short and slightly oblique-conical because
ventrally almost closed and slightly longer than dorsally, appears empty in vivo.
Occurrence and ecology: Plagiocampides halophilus likely is an extreme halophile
because it occurred in the highly (15%o) to extremely (40%o) saline and alkaline (pH 8.7-9.7)
samples from Namibian sites (57), (58), (61) and (69) as well as in an extremely saline (>
40%o) soil sample from a dry salt lagoon in the Santa Rosa National Park, Pacific west coast
of Costa Rica.
Comparison with related species: Plagiocampides halophilus is small and lacks
conspicuous features. Thus, it is difficult to distinguish from other small, inconspicuous
ciliates. Specifically, it is easily confused with small Enchelys species (oral apparatus less
conspicuous due to lack of flaps; with longitudinal dorsal brush), Chilophrya spp. (single, lip-
like oral process) and, especially, Plagiocampa spp. Fortunately, most Plagiocampa species
have one or more caudal cilia and/or are distinctly larger (60-100 urn). Further, the contrac-
tile vacuole is located slightly subterminally and ventrally, while that of P. halophilus is in
the posterior pole centre (Fig. 127a, k). Thus, it is unlikely that our organism is identical with
one of the Plagiocampa species described and reviewed by KAHL (1930a).

PERITRICHIA
Echinovorticella nov. subgen.
Diagnosis: Stalked Vorticellidae EHRENBERG, 1838 with scattered cortical spines.
Silverline system transversely striated.
Type species: Vorticella echini KING, 1931.
Etymology: Composite of echinos (Greek, hedgehog, referring to the spines) and the
generic name Vorticella (Latin; small vortex). Feminine gender.
Discussion: Our subgeneric separation might be questioned because the spines are a
highly variable, phenotypic feature. However, they are maintained in the resting cysts,
indicating a rather strong genetic fixation. Exactly the same situation exists in Hastatella and
Astylozoon, two planktonic vorticellids. Hastatella may reduce the conspicuous spines almost
completely and then looks like an Astylozoon (DINGFELDER 1962, FOISSNER et al. 1999).
Thus, if V. echini and related species are not recognized as representatives of a distinct taxon,
Hastatella and Astylozoon could be also questioned. Hastatella even lacks spines in the cystic
stage (FOISSNER et al. 1999). On the other hand, Hastatella and Astylozoon are stalkless
which justifies generic separation from Vorticella. Vorticella echini and V. voeltzkowi have a
stalk plus spines, suggesting subgeneric level.
JANKOWSKI (1976) transferred, without any new evidence, V. voeltzkowi, a proposed senior
synonym of V. echini (WARREN 1986), to Pseudovorticella. Our investigations show that this
is very likely wrong because the silverline pattern is of the vorticellid type.
Vorticella (Echinovorticella) echini KING, 1931 nov. stat. (Fig. 128a-g, i-p, s;
376a-z, 377a, c-o; Table 110)
Description of Namibian population: All observations are from cultivated
material as described below. Size 35-45 x 20-30 urn, usually 40 x 25 urn in vivo (Table
110); in American specimens 25-50 x 20-35 urn (KING 1931). Shape highly variable, that is,
elongate ellipsoidal or roughly fusiform, very broadly ellipsoidal (ratio < 1.6:1), slightly
urnulate and, in one out of 100 specimens photographed, even almost globular; peristomial
area, however, invariably narrower than broadest body region in or slightly underneath mid-
body; length:width ratio 1.4-1.9:1, on average 1.6:1, that is, broadly ellipsoidal (Table 110).
Contracted cells globular with portion between aboral ciliary wreath and scopula distinctly
invaginated (Fig. 128b, c, g, j; 376j, m-p). Body processes (spines) confined to transverse
cortical ridges in area between peristomial disk and anläge of aboral ciliary wreath, up to 4
urn long and slightly to distinctly flattened, rarely truly conical (Fig. 376g-o; Table 110).
Spines obviously part of the cell proper because containing mitochondria (Fig. 128e; 376f),
covered by the ordinary cortex, including the crest containing the silverline. Number and size
553

of spines highly variable between and within individuals. "Spiny" specimens possess about 68
large and many small spines, both irregularly alternating on the same cortical ridges (Fig.
376k-n). Rarely specimens have no spines (Fig. 376o), few large and many small spines (Fig.
376g-k, 1-n), or numerous minute, almost globular processes (Fig. 376p, q). Actually, all
transitions between "very spiny" and "smooth" cells can be observed in a single culture and at
any time. However, some of this variability might be caused by precystic specimens, which
very likely resorb the spines (see below).
Macronucleus transverse or oblique to main body axis in or above mid-body, horseshoe-
shaped to circular with ends sometimes slightly overlapping, 4-6 urn wide in vivo; nucleoli
moderately numerous and up to 1 urn across (Fig. 128a, g; 376f)- Micronucleus recognizable
neither in vivo nor in protargol preparations probably because attached to macronucleus as
recognizable in FEULGEN-prepared cysts (Fig. 128o). Contractile vacuole at mid-ventral wall
of vestibulum, that is, distinctly underneath peristomial collar. Cytopyge between contractile
vacuole and cytostome. Food vacuoles 4-7 urn across, contain bacterial remnants and spores.
Stalk without peculiarities and distinct granules, unbranched and helically contracting, 75-
140 x 3 urn in Namibian (Table 109) and 70-100 um long in American specimens (KING
1931), anterior end with cuff-like, longitudinally striated bulge (scopula ?; Fig. 128a; 376k,
n). Scopula composed of a ring of ellipsoidal granules and some globular granules within ring
(Fig. 128d). Cells attached to a wide variety of substrates, such as bacterial flocks, bark
particles, and resting cysts of Colpoda cavicola amicronucleata. Often several specimens
attach very close together, forming colony-like aggregates, especially in flourishing cultures
(Fig. 376a, c, d).
Cortex of concave type, that is, with distinct, occasionally anastomosing transverse ridges
extending across spines (Fig. 128e; 376i, m, r, s). Silverline pattern as in Vorticella (FOISSNER
1979a), widely striated (ratio body length to number of silverlines 1.15) according to the
classification by FOISSNER & SCHIFFMANN (1974); individual silverlines extend across
spines21, almost equidistant, except for three more widely spaced apical lines and the rather
closely spaced lines below the aboral ciliary wreath. Pellicular pores rather numerous, that is,
49-71, on average 57 per 100 urn2, invariably anterior to silverlines between oral opening and
aboral ciliary wreath, while posterior between aboral ciliary wreath and scopula (Fig. 128c;
377a, c-f). Anlage of aboral ciliary wreath composed of closely spaced, clockwise inclined
dikinetids in protargol preparations, while of two closely spaced, possibly poreless silverlines
framed by slightly narrowed somatic ones in KLEIN-FOISSNER silver nitrate preparations (Fig.
128c; 377c, e; Table 110).
Myoneme system very similar to that of other small vorticellids, for instance, V. infusionum
and V. aquadulcis (FOISSNER et al. 1992, 1999). Briefly, it consists of a compact ring in the
peristomial collar and about ten rather thick, more or less distinctly anastomosing, longitudi-
nal strands originating from the stalk myoneme; anteriorly, the strands attach to the adoral
ciliary spiral and dispatch fine branches into the peristomial disc (Fig. 128b; 376z).
Oral apparatus of usual structure, peristomial collar 2-3 urn thick and never projecting above
widest body region. Peristomial disk flat and obliquely raised in feeding specimens, not
21 In most specimens, some of the spines are seemingly without a silverline (Fig. 128e; 377a, c-f). We suppose,
however, a preparation artifact, that is, during dehydration of the unfixed cells some spines are deformed in such
a way that the silverlines cannot impregnate because they become located between body and spine surface.
554

umbilicate. Vestibulum (ciliated part of mouth funnel) and pharynx (where the food vacuoles
are formed) rather conspicuous because extending to dorsal side and mid-body. Oral ciliature
quite similar to that of small congeners because the proximal portion of the peniculi is
gradually shortened" (Fig. 128a, f, j, s; 376t-y). Cilia about 10 urn long; haplokinety
(undulating membrane) and polykinety (adoral ciliary spiral) describe about 1 lA turns (about
450°) on peristomial disc before plunging into the vestibulum, accomplishing a further XA
turn. Haplokinety commences, like in V. astyliformis and V. convallaria, a few basal bodies
behind polykinety, composed of dikinetids orientated obliquely to kinety axis. Polykinety
composed of many oblique rows of three basal bodies each, proximal portion forms peniculus
1. Peniculi 1 and 2 close together, long compared to peniculus 3, each composed of three
rows of basal bodies; peniculus 3 short, attached to proximal half of peniculi 1 and 2 and
likely composed of two rows only. Two epistomial membranes difficult to recognize because
each comprising only a few basal bodies (Fig. 128j, s; 376v, w): first membrane near distal
end of polykinety, second at vestibular opening, that is, about 90° distant from distal end of
polykinety.
Swarmers about 50 x 20 urn in vivo, opaque due to many granules and some food vacuoles;
cylindroidal to inconspicuous obconical with slightly narrowed mid,, bluntly pointed
posteriorly, transversely truncate anteriorly; highly contractile becoming spheroidal (Fig.
128p; 377g-j). Spines as conspicuous as in stalked specimens, directed orally, that is,
opposite to swimming direction. Cilia of aboral wreath about 13 urn long and very closely
spaced; thus, swarmers can swim very rapidly, changing direction abruptly. Epistomial
membrane composed of about four 10 urn long cilia; we did not look for the second epi-
stomial membrane.
Resting cyst as spiny as trophont^ develops on stalk whose myoneme disorganizes; two weeks
old cysts spherical, 22-28 urn (x = 24.3 urn; Table 110) across in Namibian and 10-20 urn
in American specimens (KING 1931); colourless and opaque containing many minute (~ 0.5
urn) granules (Fig. 128k-o; 377k-o). Wall 1.5-2.5 um thick and with yellowish shimmer,
slightly wrinkled in vivo, while distinctly so in preparations where spines are on conspicuous,
reticular crests; spines scattered and truly conical, that is, not flattened as in trophonts.
Macronucleus almost circular with single micronucleus attached, reorganizes by splitting into
several globules of different size (Fig. 128m, n); micronuclear divisions were not observed.
We recognized too late that encystment is possibly much more complicated than described
above, that is, have evidence that the spines are resorbed and rebuilt during the process: (i) the
seven cysts studied in the scanning electron microscope all have spines of very similar length
(1.4-2.1 urn), that is, the high variability of the spine length recognizable in the trophic cells
(<, 0.5—3.3 urn in the SEM) disappears; (ii) some light micrographs ofyoung cysts, still being
attached to the stalk, strongly suggest that the spines are partially or fully resorbed and rebuilt
(Fig. 377 1, k) while the organism is still attached to the stalk; (iii) the spine pattern changes,
that is, the transverse arrangement becomes scattered (Fig. 377n, o). Furthermore, a change in
spine length becomes obvious when the proportions of the largest spines (3.3 urn and 2.1 urn)
are calculated (all from SEM micrographs): mean trophic cell width (without
spines)/maximum trophic spine length 5.2:1; mean cyst diameter (without spines)/maximum
cyst spine length 9.4:1. Thus, spines are disproportionally shorter in cysts than in trophonts.
22 In the campanulate species, peniculus 2 is distinctly shorter than peniculi 1 and 3. This produces an arrow-
like pattern in the proximal part of the ciliary spiral (FOISSNER et al. 1992).

and another at vestibular opening in V. echini (s); two epistomial membranes, namely, one at distal quarter of adoral spiral
and another at vestibular opening in V. infusionum (t; from FOISSNER et al. 1992). AW - aboral ciliary wreath, ES -

Whether the cyst spines are a product of the cell or the ectocyst needs transmission electron
microscope investigations. If the spines are a product of the ectocyst, the species should be
separated at genus level because all other peritrich cysts, including those of V. voeltzkowi,
lack any spines, and this feature is as distinct as any other used in peritrich genus taxonomy.
In principle, it is not impossible that the spines belong entirely to the cyst wall because, for
instance, many hypotrich resting cysts have conspicuous spines although trophonts have none
(BERGER 1999).

Occurrence and ecology: KING (1931) discovered V. echini in a culture of green-
house soil and pond water from Iowa, USA. The Namibian population was found in a
558

moderately saline sample containing thin, paper-like bark from live and dead Moringa trees.
It grew well in cultures set up in Eau de Volvic containing some crashed wheat grains and
part of the indigenous bacterial flora and protist community.
Comparison with related species: WARREN (1986) suggested synonymy of V.
voeltzkowi and V. echini. We disagree, mainly because V. voeltzkowi SONDHEIM, 1929 has
smooth resting cysts (like Hastatellal) distinctly different from the spiniferous cysts of V.
echini (Fig. 128m) and the Namibian specimens (Fig. 128k, 1, n, o; 377k-o). Further
differences occur, namely, in body shape and number of spine rows. SONDHEIM (1929)
definitely states (translated from German): "Size 30-40 urn in diameter" and, later, "the body
is usually entirely globular" (Fig. 128h). SONDHEIM illustrates 14 transverse spine rows (Fig.
128h), while the spines of V. echini and our population are much more scattered, showing
only about five spines along body margin in optical section (Fig. 128a, i). The Namibian
specimens agree well with those observed by KING (1931), with a significant difference,
however: the spines of KING'S cells are 10 urn long, while those of the Namibian specimens
measure only up to 4 urn both in raw (non-flooded Petri dish) and pure cultures. This
produces a rather different appearance (Fig. 128a, i). Further, the resting cysts of the
American population are distinctly smaller (10-20 urn) than those of the Namibian specimens
(22-28 urn; Table 109). Thus, our identification may be questioned, and the material cannot
serve as neotype. On the other hand, our observations show that the length of the spines is
highly variable. Possibly, optimal conditions were lacking in our cultures.
In vivo, the conspicuous spines are a unique feature of the V. echini zooids, swarmers, and
cysts. The length of the spines, however, varies like in Hastatella radians ERLANGER, 1890,
whose spines become fewer and distinctly smaller when reproducing for some weeks in patch
culture (FOISSNER 1977, FoiSSNER et al. 1999). Zooids of V. echini detached from the stalk
may be confused with such poorly developed specimens of Hastatella radians; if in doubt,
check arrangement of spines (scattered on body vs. arranged in an anterior and equatorial
girdle; FOISSNER 1977, FOISSNER et al. 1999). Only spineless individuals of V. echini can be
confused with other small congeners, namely, V. astyliformis [49-71 vs. 70-120 pellicular
pores per 100 urn2, pores invariably attached anteriorly vs. usually posteriorly to silverlines
above ciliary wreath, 29-32 (x - 30) vs. 17-30 (x = 21, 25 in two populations) silverlines
above aboral ciliary wreath; Fig. 378a-g; FOISSNER 1981a]; V. infusionum (common body
size 40 x 25 urn vs. 45-60 x 30—40 urn, 3-5 vs. 6-13 silverlines below aboral ciliary wreath,
pellicular pores invariably attached anteriorly vs. occasionally posteriorly to silverlines above
aboral ciliary wreath, epistomial membrane 1 at vs. about 90° distant from distal end of adoral
ciliary spiral; Fig. 128t; 377b; FOISSNER et al. 1992); and V. octava (body shape never vs.
slightly campanulate, 3-5 vs. 9-16 silverlines below aboral ciliary wreath; FOISSNER et al.
1992). Both, V. infusionum and V. octava, occur very rarely in terrestrial biotopes.
Of high interest is the occurrence of two epistomial membranes in V. echini, a feature as yet
documented only in V. infusionum (FOISSNER et al. 1992). Unfortunately, the second
epistomial membrane is difficult to recognize and thus could have been overlooked in other
species. On the other hand, there can hardly be any doubt that peritrichs, such as V.
convallaria and Opisthonecta spp., possess only a single epistomial membrane. Certainly, the
single or double epistomial membrane is a strong feature that can be used for a meaningful
further split (first split: Pseudovorticella FOISSNER & SCHIFFMANN 1974) of the large genus
Vorticella (Fig. 128q-t). However, more data are required, as explained above.

1977 Epistylis alpestris (FOISSNER, 1977) — FOISSNER, Protistologica, 13: 372 (protargol impregnation of
oral structures and myoneme system).
1978 Epistylis alpestris FOISSNER, Annin naturh. Mus. Wien, 81: 558 (original description).
Epistylis alpestris was discovered in astatic pools of the Austrian Central Alps. Since then, we
have found it in similar habitats all over the world. In Namibia, E. alpestris occurred at sites
(49, 70, 73), viz., in a small, astatic saline pan and in mud of rock pools of a stream, showing
that it is euryhaline.
The various populations are highly similar in size, shape of body and macronucleus, number
of cortical striae (silverlines), and the facetted resting cysts. For details, see figure explana-
tions.

HYPOTRICHIA
About one third of 128 new species discovered in the 73 soil samples are hypotrichs. This
matches the high dominance of soil hypotrichs in general (FOISSNER 1998a) and might be
associated with the flexible, elongated body pre-adapting hypotrichs for life in microporous
(soil) environments. Both saline and desert habitats are rich in new species, showing the
evolutionary pressure of extreme habitats.
Many of the new species look inconspicuous, that is, are small and of ordinary shape.
However, more detailed investigations show that they are not only undescribed, but also
representatives of new genera. Indeed, some of the new "ontogenetic" genera established in
this book are so surprising and unexplainable that hypotrich classification appears hopelessly
complicated. Thus, we renounced to classify them in new families. And there is no indication
that further new taxa to be discovered will clear the matter!
We still have about 200 undescribed soil hypotrichs in our notebooks, showing that the
present study just touched the peak of an iceberg. It is even possible that there are more
terrestrial than (described) limnetic hypotrichs. This bewildering diversity shows that there
must be thousands of hypotrich species, most still undescribed.
Bakuellagranulifera nov. spec. (Fig. 129a-k; 380a-c, f-h; Table 111)
Diagnosis: Size about 320 x 100 urn in vivo; oblong. About 350 macronuclear nodules.
Cortical granules citrine, in series between cirral and bristle rows. On average 54 adoral
membranelies, 8 buccal cirri, 4 frontoterminal cirri, 18 pairs of midventral cirri, 4 short and
long midventral rows, and 12 transverse cirri.
Type location: Sieved litter from the bank of the Bukaos River, about 80 km north of
the town of Keetmanshoop, Namibia, 25°40'S 18°10'E (site 4 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin granulifera (bearing granules) refers to the conspicuous cortical
granules.
Description: Size 270-400 x 70-120 urn in vivo, usually about 320 x 100 urn,
length:width ratio 3.0-4.1:1, on average 3.2:1 in vivo and protargol preparations; only 200-
300 x 70-120 urn in Namibian site (60) specimens. Outline elongate elliptical, anterior
portion curved leftwards during foraging, providing cells with a reniform appearance; body
flattened about 2:1 dorsoventrally, very flexible and contractile by about 10% under mild
cover glass pressure (Fig. 129a-e; Table 111). Macronuclear nodules scattered throughout
cell, small but numerous and thus difficult to count; type specimen with about 356 nodules,
indicating that the range is somewhere between 250 and 400; individual nodules about 7-10 x
3-4 urn in vivo, usually ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal, but also globular, reniform, or
dumb-bell-shaped, each with some small nucleoli (Fig. 129j, k). Micronuclei difficult to
recognize in vivo and protargol preparations, likely several scattered throughout cell, 3-4 urn
across after protargol impregnation. Contractile vacuole with two conspicuous collecting
561

canals at left body margin distinctly above mid-body at level of buccal vertex. Cells yellow at
low (xlOO) magnification due to conspicuous cortical granules in short series mainly between
cirral and bristle rows; individual granules 1.3-1.5 x 0.8-1.0 urn in size, that is, ellipsoidal
and brilliant citrine, do not impregnate with the protargol method used (Fig. 129f, g; 380a-f).
Cytoplasm colourless, contains fat globules 1-3 urn across, 10-20 nm-sized food vacuoles
with compact content, and irregular egestion vacuoles up to 50 um across. Voracious
predator, ingesting fungal spores, diatoms, testate amoebae {Euglypha sp., Trinema lineare),
ciliates (Colpoda sp., Uroleptus notabilis, Urosoma karinae), and even rotifers up to 80 urn
long. Moves quickly on microscope slide and soil particles showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 129a, h; 380g, h; Table 111).
Marginal, frontoterminal, and midventral cirri 15-17 urn long in vivo. Right marginal row
extends onto dorsolateral surface anteriorly, ends more subterminally than left, which is J-
shaped, curving along rear body margin. Frontal cirri conspicuously enlarged and about 22
urn long in vivo, right one, as is usual, at distal end of adoral zone of membranelles;
frequently two cirri behind right frontal cirrus. Buccal cirral row right of anterior half of
paroral, cirri become slightly smaller from anterior to posterior. Frontoterminal cirral row
short, right of anteriormost pair of midventral cirri. Midventral row composed of an anterior
portion of about 18 cirral pairs terminating near mid-body, and a posterior portion of slightly
oblique, short and long rows (terminology according to EIGNER 1994); rightmost long
midventral row terminates at right transverse cirrus, as in some congeners. Transverse cirri
about 18 urn long in vivo, small and closely spaced in oblique row, do not, or only slightly,
project beyond body end.
Dorsal bristles about 4 urn long in vivo, arranged in, likely invariably, three bipolar rows
leaving blank broad, fusiform stripe in midline; rows 1 and 2 extend near left body margin,
row 3 runs near right (Fig. 129i). Caudal cirri lacking.
Adoral zone conspicuous because occupying 30—42%, on average 35% of body length, of
usual shape and structure; composed of an average of 54 membranelles, bases of largest
membranelles about 20 urn wide in vivo (Fig. 129a, h; 38Og, h; Table 111). Buccal cavity
deep and large, at right partially covered by slightly curved, hyaline lip bearing paroral
membrane in inconspicuous furrow and covering proximal end of adoral zone of membra-
nelles. Paroral membrane distinctly curved anteriorly, likely composed of zigzagging basal
bodies having about 15 jam long cilia, optically intersects with bow-shaped endoral
membrane ahead or near mid of buccal cavity; cilia of endoral anteriorly about 20 \xm,
posteriorly about 40 urn (!) long, extending deeply into the pharynx. Pharyngeal fibres
conspicuous in vivo and protargol preparations, of ordinary length and structure, extend
almost longitudinally to posterior half of cell.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, where it was moderately
abundant, and at Namibian site (60), a saline soil from the Sporobolus zone around the Etosha
Pan. Thus, it is euryhaline.
Comparison with related species: Bakuella granulifera is very likely closely
related to B. edaphoni SONG, WILBERT & BERGER, 1992, which is also very large (190-300 x
50-85 urn in vivo) and has an almost identical cirral pattern. The main difference is the
conspicuous cortical granules (Fig. 380a-f), which are lacking in B. edaphoni (pers. comm. of
W. SONG, who investigated B. edaphoni, to H. BERGER). However, Bakuella granulifera and
B. edaphoni also differ significantly in several morphometrics, namely, size (319 x 101 urn

adoral membranelles (31), buccal cirri (5), cirral pairs in the midventral row (9), transverse
cirri (4), and macronuclear nodules (about 100), and a slightly higher number of fronto-
terminal cirri (6 vs. 3-4 in B. granulifera). There is no basic morphological difference
565

between these two species, and thus subspecies rank would probably be more appropriate. On
the other hand, the quantitative differences are conspicuous and not caused by a simple size
increase of the cell (which may depend on culture conditions; —> Hemiurosoma goertzi), but
concern the entire organism, as evident from, e.g., the doubled number of adoral membra-
nelles, midventral cirral pairs, and macronuclear nodules.
In vivo, Bakuella granulifera is easily confused with Holosticha muscorum KAHL, 1932,
which has a similar size (220-330 x 70-90 um in vivo), cortical granulation, and cirral
pattern (for detailed redescription, see FoiSSNER 1982). However, Holosticha species lack the
short and long cirral rows at the posterior end of the midventral row.
Uroleptusparanotabilis nov. spec. (Fig. 130a-i; 38le, h, i; Table 112)
Diagnosis: Size about 130 x 20 urn in vivo; very slenderly lanceolate. Usually 16
macronuclear nodules forming ± distinct strand left of midline. Cortical granules yellowish to
citrine, < 0.5 urn across, scattered throughout cortex and in clusters around cirri and dorsal
bristles. Midventral row terminates above mid-body, composed of about 14 cirri. On average
22-24 adoral membranelies, about 30 cirri each in right and left marginal row, 1 buccal
cirrus, 1 cirrus behind right frontal cirrus, 2 frontoterminal cirri, 2 transverse cirri very near to
posterior body end, 4 dorsal kineties, and 3 caudal cirri.
Type location: Dung balls formed by a large Scarabaeus at the Bambatsi Guest Farm in
Namibia, 20°10'S 15°25'E (site 52 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Greek word para (beside) and the Latin adverb notabilis
(curious), meaning a ciliate similar to Uroleptus notabilis.
Description: Two Namibian populations were studied, namely from site (52; type
population) and site (4). They agree so well in all features that conspecificity is beyond
reasonable doubt. In spite of this, morphometric data are kept separate, but the diagnosis
contains both, while the Antarctic population is excluded because it might be a distinct
subspecies.
Size 110-170 x 15-30 urn in vivo, length:width ratio 5-8:1 in vivo, 4.7-9.1:1, on average
6.6:1 in protargol preparations; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1. Outline slenderly lanceo-
late and often slightly sigmoidal with posterior portion narrowed and curved rightwards;
anterior region usually with distinct furrow along dorsal kinety 4 (Fig. 130a-c; Table 112);
body very flexible but acontractile, frequently slightly to distinctly twisted about main axis.
Macronuclear nodules mainly left of midline in a ventral and dorsal strand one upon the other
in about 50% of specimens, while slightly scattered in 15% and distinctly so in 35% of cells;
anteriormost nodules usually dislocated rightwards; individual nodules ellipsoidal to elongate
ellipsoidal, rarely globular or reniform, contain small to medium-sized nucleoli and some-
times a cubic protein crystal (Fig. 130a, i, h; 38 li). On average two to three micronuclei
within macronuclear strand; individual micronuclei globular to ellipsoidal, up to 5 x 2.5 urn
in vivo. Contractile vacuole with inconspicuous collecting canals slightly above mid-body at
left cell margin. Cortical granules clustered around cirri and dorsal bristles and scattered
throughout cortex, although only < 0.5 urn in size well recognizable because brilliant citrine
566

in type population and yellowish in Namibian site (4) specimens (Fig. 130d); impregnate
slightly to heavily with the protargol method used. Cytoplasm colourless, contains some fat
globules 1-5 um across and many, almost empty food vacuoles 4—6 urn in diameter.
Movement without peculiarities, that is, swims and glides rather rapidly on microscope slide
and debris showing great flexibility.

Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability, except for the rather strongly varying
number of midventral cirri (Fig. 130a, f; Table 112). Most cirri 8-10 urn long in vivo and of
similar size. Marginal rows end subterminally, right row commences near level of buccal
cirrus. Frontal cirri slightly enlarged, form oblique row with right cirrus, as is usual, behind
distal adoral membranelle; invariably one cirrus behind right frontal cirrus. Buccal cirrus
slightly behind anterior end of paroral membrane and near level of anterior end of endoral.
Two frontoterminal cirri slightly ahead anterior end of right marginal row. Frontoventral cirri
only indistinctly zigzagging, midventral pattern thus difficult to recognize in live and
prepared specimens; midventral row terminates between 26% and 46%, on average at 33% of
body length. Transverse cirri terminal and thus distinctly projecting, although only incon-
spicuously longer than marginal cirri.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in four rows usually easily recognizable
both in vivo and protargol preparations due to the cortical granules clustered around the
bristles (Fig. 130d, g). Row 1 composed of only few (about 5-7), widely spaced bristles and
likely without caudal cirrus, indicating that it is a vestige from the previous generation. Rows
2 to 4 almost bipolar and associated with one caudal cirrus each. Caudal cirri not longer than
marginal and transverse cirri.
Adoral zone occupies 17-26%, on average 21% of body length, of usual shape and structure;
composed of an average of 23 membranelies, bases of largest membranelles up to 7 um wide
in vivo (Fig. 130a, e, f; 381e, h, i; Table 112). Buccal cavity flat and narrow, right margin
forms inconspicuous lip partially covering proximal portion of adoral zone and bearing
paroral membrane composed of an about 9 urn long, slightly curved, zigzagging series of 5
urn long cilia; endoral membrane about as long and curved as paroral, but shifted slightly
backwards. Pharynx without peculiarities in vivo and protargol preparations, that is, lacks the
rod-shaped structures described in all Uroleptus notabilis populations.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, where it was abundant, and
at Namibian site (4), where it was rare. Furthermore, Uroleptus paranotabilis occurred in soil
from the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, where it was misidentified as Uroleptus notabilis
(see below). Uroleptus paranotabilis is well adapted to soil life with its slender body shape.
Generic assignment and comparison with related species: Generic
assignment is according to FOISSNER et al. (1991, p. 248 and 252). Briefly, Holosticha,
Paruroleptus, and Uroleptus pose nomenclatural and taxonomic problems not yet solved.
Thus, we assign our populations to the oldest genus Uroleptus. However, the very different
oral apparatus of U. paranotabilis and U. notabilis indicate that the former might belong to
another genus altogether, viz., Holosticha, Hemisincirra, or Holostichides. Possibly,
ontogenesis will provide deeper insights.
The overall appearance of Uroleptus paranotabilis is very similar to U notabilis (FOISSNER,
1982) FOISSNER, 1998a, of which four populations have been described, namely from Austria
(Fig. 130j, k), Germany (Fig. 130 1, m), Australia (Fig. 130n, o), and Antarctica (Fig. 130p,
q). However, the oral apparatus" is different, not only in the Namibian but also the Antarctic
population, which thus belongs to Uroleptus paranotabilis: the buccal field is large and deep
23 We re-examined the protargol slides of all U. notabilis populations mentioned and found that the undulating
membranes and pharyngeal structures were correctly illustrated, that is, as shown in figures 130j, 1, n, p.
569

vs. narrow and flat; the undulating membranes are long and distinctly curved vs. short and
almost straight; the distance between the anterior end of the undulating membranes and the
buccal cirrus is considerable larger in U. notabilis than U. paranotabilis; and the pharynx is
surrounded by conspicuous, rod-shaped organelles only in U. notabilis (Fig. 130j, 1, n, p, r).
Furthermore, the cortical granules are usually larger (about 2 x 1 urn) in U. notabilis than U.
paranotabilis (< 1 urn across), and the macronuclear nodules are more numerous (25-70 vs.
up to 30) and scattered (vs. in ± distinct series left of midline) in the former than the latter
(Fig. 130k, m, o, q, s).

The Antarctic population of Uroleptus paranotabilis differs rather distinctly from the
Namibian specimens, indicating that it is a distinct subspecies: three dorsal kineties vs. four
(Fig. 130q, s); cortical granules colourless vs. yellowish; buccal cirrus at posterior vs. anterior
half of paroral membrane (Fig. 130p, r); six vs. two transverse and pretransverse cirri (Fig.
130p, r). However, similar differences occur in the Uroleptus notabilis populations (Fig.
130j-o). The German specimens differ from the type population and the Australian popula-
tion in body size and correlated features, the size of the cortical granules (0.5 urn across vs. 2
x 1 urn), the number of macronuclear nodules (25-35 vs. 47-70), and the number of
transverse cirri (2 vs. 2-6, usually 4). The Australian specimens differ from the European
populations in having four instead of three dorsal kineties.
In vivo, Uroleptus paranotabilis is not only easily confused with U. notabilis (look at the
buccal field!), but also with quite a lot of other soil hypotrichs, such as multinucleate ->
Hemiurosoma, —> Hemisincirra and —» Periholosticha species, as well as certain
amphisiellids. Thus, both in vivo observation (cortical granules!) and protargol impregnation
are necessary for a reliable identification. However, if a specimen has the following features
in vivo, then it is likely Uroleptus paranotabilis: size about 130 x 20 urn, that is, slenderly
lanceolate; buccal field moderately narrow and flat; about 20 macronuclear nodules in
indistinct series left of midline; frontoventral row slightly to distinctly longer than adoral zone
and composed of rather indistinct cirral pairs; cortical granules colourless to yellowish,
minute (< 1 urn) and mainly around cirri and dorsal bristles, do not form distinct rows; 3-4
dorsal kineties; 1 buccal cirrus and 1-6 transverse and pretransverse ventral cirri.
Eschaneustyla lugeri nov. spec. (Fig. 131a-n; 382a-c; Table 113)
Diagnosis: Size about 220 x 55 urn in vivo, slightly contractile. Outline elongate elliptical
to slightly sigmoidal. On average 60 macronuclear nodules and 56 adoral membranelies.
Cortical granules colourless, around cirri and dorsal bristles and scattered throughout cortex.
On average 4 buccal cirri, a long ventral row consisting of about 28 cirri, and a conspicuously
long row of frontoterminal cirri ending in rear third of body. Frontal area densely ciliated by
an average of 32 cirri forming distinct, curved rows.
Type location: Forest soil from Taveuni island, Fiji Islands, 16°52'S 180°W.
Dedication: Dedicated to Mr. Gerhard LUGER (Salzburg), an excellent orthopaedist, who
collected the sample.
Description: Size 180-260 x 45-65 urn in vivo, usually near 220 x 55 urn, length:width
ratio 3.5-5:1 in vivo, on average 4:1 in vivo and protargol preparations (Table 113). Outline
elongate elliptical and often slightly sigmoidal, frequently somewhat irregular, that is, with
small convexities and concavities, possibly due to slight contractions, as indicated by
specimens under mild cover glass pressure which contract by up to 30%. Anterior body
portion frequently slightly set off from body proper, that is, cephalized. Flattened about 2:1
dorsoventrally with anterior and posterior portion rather thin (Fig. 131a-d; 382a). Macro-
nuclear nodules moderately variable in number and shape (Table 113), usually arranged as
shown in figure 131k; individual nodules about 10 x 5 urn in vivo, ellipsoidal to elongate
ellipsoidal, globular, or dumb-bell-shaped, each with some small nucleoli. Micronuclei
572

scattered, sometimes clumped, about 4 urn across, compact and thus easy to recognize in vivo
and protargol preparations. Contractile vacuole with two conspicuous collecting canals at left
body margin slightly above mid-body. Cortex very flexible, contains two size types of
colourless granules and rather conspicuous crystals (Fig. 131f-h): type I granules about 1 x
0.5 urn, around cirri and dorsal bristles; type II granules < 0.5 urn, scattered, highly refractive
and thus rather conspicuous despite their minuteness; both granule types do not impregnate
with protargol, but stain pink and swell to 2-3 um long rods forming a thin cover after
addition of methyl green-pyronin. Cortical or subcortical crystals rod-shaped, 2-4 urn long
and often orientated in main body axis, do not occur in deeper cytoplasmic areas. Cytoplasm
colourless, without conspicuous inclusions. Food vacuoles with bacteria only about 5 urn
across, those with heterotrophic flagellates and organic debris up to 20 urn across; also feeds
on up to 100 urn long fungal hyphae, 20-30 x 5-10 um-sized fungal conidia, and small
Euglypha species (Fig. 131a; 382a). Movement inconspicuous, glides rather rapidly on
microscope slide and soil particles showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 131a, i, n; Table 113). Most cirri
only 10 urn long in vivo. Right marginal row distinctly shortened anteriorly, ends subtermi-
nal; left row distinctly curved rightwards anteriorly, terminates on average 18 urn ahead of
rear body end. Frontal area very conspicuous because densely covered by an average of 32
slightly enlarged cirri forming rather distinct rows24; prominent frontal cirri and midventral
pairs absent. Usually four buccal cirri right of mid-portion of paroral membrane, last cirrus
often slightly smaller. Invariably two long, slightly oblique ventral cirral rows, left begins at
13% of body length and terminates at 49% on average; according to EiGNER's (1994)
ontogenetic investigations, it is a long midventral row. Right ventral row, which is a row of
frontoterminal cirri according to EIGNER (1994), commences at 11% of body length and
terminates at 69%. Transverse cirri lacking.
Dorsal cilia about 3 um long in vivo, arranged in four meridional rows; rows 3 and 4 usually
slightly shortened anteriorly. Each row with two or three small and thus inconspicuous caudal
cirri (Fig. 131j, m).
Adoral zone occupies 25-38%, on average 30% of body length, composed of an average of
56 membranelles, bases of largest membranelles about 13 urn wide in vivo; distal portion
extends far on right body side causing the slight cephalization mentioned above; proximal
portion slightly sigmoidal, a conspicuous (compared to many other hypotrichs) feature not
described in the congeners studied by FOISSNER (1982) and EIGNER (1994), but recognizable
in their figures; such peculiarities are usually lost in protargol preparations, as also evident
from the following observations (Fig. 13la^ e, i, n; 382a, c). Buccal apparatus in vivo as in
congeners, that is, extremely narrow and flat compared to size of cell and many other
hypotrichs (Fig. 131a, e; 382b, c); much more prominent and thus of ordinary appearance in
protargol preparations, possibly due to slight inflation of cavity and/or some contraction of
the oral region. Likewise, paroral and endoral pattern very different in vivo and after
protargol impregnation: paroral in vivo at base of buccal lip, almost straight and slightly
curved rightwards, while distinctly curved leftwards and optically intersecting with endoral in
silver preparations. Both membranes likely composed of dikinetids, paroral slightly thickened
(broadened) in anterior 5 urn, cilia up to 6 urn long (Fig. 131a, e, i, n). Pharyngeal fibres
24 We did not find dividers and thus cannot define the pattern; a proposal is given in figure 13In.

Generic classification and comparison with related species: At first
glance, this species looks like the representative of a new genus because of the numerous
frontal cirri forming distinct coronas (Fig. 131a, i). However, the following features assign it
rather unequivocally to Eschaneustyla STOKES, 1886a, which belongs to the Urostylidae,
according to the ontogenetic data of EIGNER (1994): (i) ventral cirral pattern in short and long
rows (midventral rows according to EIGNER 1994); (ii) buccal cavity very flat and narrow
compared to size of cell; (iii) slightly sigmoidal adoral zone extending far on right side of cell;

(iv) broadened anterior end of paroral; (v) four dorsal kineties each associated with more than
one caudal cirrus; (vi) lack of transverse cirri. Furthermore, both terrestrial species now
assigned to Eschaneustyla (see below) have cortical granules, many small macronuclear
577

nodules, and an anteriorly shortened right marginal row. A broadened anterior end of the
paroral, first described by EIGNER (1994) in E. brachytona, evolved convergently in the
oxytrichid Notohymena BLATTERER & FOISSNER, 1988. However, the vitiphilan species could
belong to another, or even a new genus if ontogenetic data show that the frontal cirri are not
arranged in oblique rows but in curved coronas (Fig. 13 In). This is emphasized by some
further differences mentioned in the next paragraph.
Eschaneustyla lugeri differs from E. brachytona STOKES, 1886a and —> E. terricola
FOISSNER, 1982 by the numerous and thus conspicuous frontal cirri evenly distributed on the
frontal area; no single (left) frontal cirrus, so conspicuous in E. brachytona and —> E.
terricola, is recognizable. Furthermore, the leftmost ventral cirral row of E. lugeri borders the
cirri on the frontal field, while it commences farther subapically in E. brachytona and -» E.
terricola, where the oblique frontal rows thus abut on the frontoterminal cirral row. There are
also several distinct quantitative differences: 4 buccal cirri vs. 1 cirrus, 2 vs. 4 long ventral
rows, 56 vs. 39—46 adoral membranelles. In vivo, Eschaneustyla lugeri can be easily
recognized by the following combination of features: length 180-260 urn; many macro-
nuclear nodules; many cirri on frontal field forming several coronas; four buccal cirri; two
ventral cirral rows.
Generally, in vivo Eschaneustyla spp. are difficult to separate from Bakuella spp. and large
Holosticha species. Thus, identifications should be checked by protargol impregnation.
Eschaneustyla terricola FOISSNER, 1982 (Fig. 38If, g)
The specimens from Namibian site (30) are rather different from the type; specifically, they
are larger (about 200 x 40 urn vs. 160 x 45 urn in vivo) and have a distinct midventral row in
the frontal area, lacking in the Austrian type population. However, the specimens studied by
EIGNER (1994) are between these extremes, indicating high variability or cryptic speciation.
The latter is emphasized by the yellowish cortical granules, which are more distinct and
differently arranged in the Namibian specimens, where they are brilliantly yellowish and form
conspicuous clusters around the dorsal bristles, while they are loosely arranged in the
unciliated body parts (Fig. 38If, g). Furthermore, the clusters consist of two size and shape
types of granules: ellipsoidal to ovate and about 1 x 0.5 urn in size and globular 0.4-0.6 urn
across.
EIGNER (1994) hastily synonymized the yellowish E. terricola FOISSNER, 1982 with the
colourless, limnetic E. brachytona STOKES, 1886a. As STOKES (1886a) was a careful
observer, this indicates that the species lacks, or has colourless granules. Accordingly,
EiGNER's synonymization should not be followed until a limnetic Eschaneustyla population
has been investigated in detail. As shown by the previous species and the Namibian popula-
tion described above, the genus is richer than hitherto recognized.
578

Holosticha brachysticha nov. spec. (Fig. 132a-g; Table 114)
Diagnosis: Size about 90 x 17 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal. On average 32 scattered
macronuclear nodules. Cortical granules around cirri and dorsal bristles, yellowish, about
1.0-1.5 x 0.5-0.8 urn in size. Midventral row terminates at about 1/3 of body length,
composed of about 10 cirri. On average 16 adoral membranelles, 23 cirri each in right and left
marginal row, 1 buccal cirrus, 2 frontoterminal cirri, 3 transverse cirri, and 3 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Sandy, saline coastal soil (pH 7.6) near PuntaPirikiki, about 54 km south
of Limon, Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, Central America, 09°40'N 82°40'W.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek adjective brachy (short) and the Greek noun sticha
(row), referring to the short midventral row.
Description: Size 70-110 x 15-20 urn, usually around 90 x 17 urn in vivo, length:width
ratio on average 5.3:1 both in vivo and protargol preparations (Table 114); dorsoventrally
flattened up to 2:1. Body elongate elliptical, very flexible but acontractile (Fig. 132a, b).
Macronuclear nodules usually scattered in U-shaped pattern in central portion of cell;
individual nodules usually ellipsoidal, rarely globular, elongate ellipsoidal, or dumb-bell-
shaped; nucleoli small. On average two ellipsoidal micronuclei within macronuclear figure.
Contractile vacuole slightly above mid-body at left cell margin, without distinct collecting
canals. Cortical granules only in clusters around cirri and dorsal bristles, yellowish, conspicu-
ously brilliant because compact, about 1.0-1.5 x 0.5-0.8 urn in size, do not impregnate with
the protargol method used. Cytoplasm colourless, without peculiarities, that is, contains some
ordinary, yellowish crystals about 1-2 urn long and some food vacuoles 5-7 urn across.
Feeds on tuberous bacteria. Swims and glides moderately quickly on microscope slide and
debris showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 132a, e; Table 114). Marginal and
midventral cirri about 10 urn long in vivo and of similar size, that is, usually composed of 2 x
2 cilia. Right marginal row shortened anteriorly, terminates, like left row, near posterior end
of cell. Frontal cirri slightly enlarged, in transverse, concave line, as in most congeners.
Buccal cirrus usually composed of two cilia only, slightly behind anterior end of paroral
membrane and thus near level of anterior end of endoral. Two frontoterminal cirri right of
anterior end of midventral row usually composed of four to five cirral pairs only, thus
terminating at about 34% of body length. Transverse cirri almost terminal, about 15 urn long
in vivo and thus distinctly projecting beyond rear body end; anterior cirrus usually smaller
than other cirri and thus likely a pretransverse cirrus.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in three rows easily recognizable in vivo
due to the granule clusters around the individual bristles. Rows 1 and 2 distinctly shortened
anteriorly, row 3 bipolar. Caudal cirri lacking.
Adoral zone occupies 20-27%, on average 23% of body length, composed of an average of
16 membranelles of usual shape and structure (Fig. 132a, e). Buccal cavity of ordinary width
but flat, right margin forms inconspicuous lip partially covering proximal portion of adoral
zone of membranelles. Paroral and endoral of about same length and almost in parallel, with
endoral on average 2 jam rearward. Pharyngeal fibres distinct after protargol impregnation,
extend to near mid-body.

Comparison with related species: The overall appearance of Holosticha
brachysticha is similar to H. mancoidea HEMBERGER, 1985; H. sigmoidea FoiSSNER, 1982; H.
tetracirrata BUITKAMP & WiLBERT, 1974; H. manca plurinucleata GELLERT, 1956; and ->
Uroleptus paranotabilis. However, H. mancoidea has fewer macronuclear nodules (6-12 vs.
28-38), more transverse and pretransverse cirri (5 plus 2 vs. 2 plus 1), and the distal four
adoral membranelles are distinctly set off. Furthermore, HEMBERGER (1985) did not describe

cortical granules; however, such granules might have been overlooked because he did not
study live specimens in detail. Holosticha sigmoidea has, inter alia, a series of 6-9 macro-
nuclear nodules (vs. 28-38 scattered nodules), more dorsal kineties (4 vs. 3), transverse cirri
(5-8 vs. usually 3), and adoral membranelles (16-24, on average 20 vs. 13—17, on average
581

16), and the colourless cortical granules are arranged in many longitudinal rows (vs. clustered
around cirri and bristles). Holosticha tetracirrata, which has almost the same average number
and pattern of macronuclear nodules, has four dorsal kineties (vs. three), more adoral
membranelies (24 vs. 16), a longer midventral row (67% of body length vs. 34%), and lacks
cortical granules. Holosticha manca plurinucleata has only 22 macronuclear nodules (vs. 32)
and 11 adoral membranelles (vs. 16), but possesses more transverse (5 vs. 3) and midventral
cirri (21 vs. 9-13). -» Uroleptus paranotabilis and U. notabilis (FOISSNER, 1982) FOISSNER,
1998a have caudal cirri; furthermore, most populations are longer (> 110 urn) and have more
adoral membranelles (> 22 vs. 13-17) and marginal cirri (> 34 vs. 23).
In vivo, Holosticha brachysticha is recognizable by the rather small size (around 100 x 20
urn), the ellipsoidal, yellowish cortical granules around the cirri and dorsal bristles, the short
midventral row, the low number of transverse cirri, and the scattered macronuclear nodules.
Periholosticha lanceolata HEMBERGER, 1985 (Fig. 133a-l, q-y; Table 115)
Improved diagnosis (based on original description and our data): Size about 110 x 12
urn in vivo; slenderly lanceolate with posterior region narrowed, more or less distinctly tail-
like. On average 16 macronuclear nodules in two strands one upon the other along left
postoral body margin. Cortical granules between cirri and around dorsal bristles, colourless,
compact and thus refractive, 0.5-1 x 0.4-0.8 urn. Cirri composed of 2-4 cilia. On average 16
adoral membranelles, 3 frontal separated by minute gap; 13 frontoventral cirri forming
indistinct midventral pattern in anterior half of row extending to second body third; 30 right
and 26 left marginal cirri; 3 dorsal kineties and caudal cirri each.
Description of Maldivean population (Fig. 133a—j; Table 115): Size 70-150 x
10-15 urn in vivo, usually about 110 x 12 um, length:width ratio highly variable, viz., 6.3-
11.8:1, on average 8.7:1 in protargol preparations; usually only slightly, rarely up to 2:1
flattened dorsoventrally. Slenderly lanceolate, posterior region narrows rather abruptly, tail-
like, most specimens slightly to distinctly twisted about main body axis (Fig. 133a, b, j; Table
115); acontractile but very flexible. Macronuclear nodules in two more or less distinct strands
on upon the other along postoral left body margin; individual nodules globular to elongate
ellipsoidal, on average 4x3 urn in protargol preparations; nucleoli of ordinary size. Usually
one slightly ellipsoidal micronucleus in anterior and in posterior portion of nuclear figure.
Contractile yacuole distinctly above mid-body at left cell margin, collecting canals long but
thin and thus inconspicuous. Cortical granules between cirri and around dorsal bristles, stain
red with methyl green-pyronin and, occasionally, black with the protargol method used;
individual granules colourless, but compact and thus highly refractive, about 1 x 0.8 urn (Fig.
133a, c-e). Cytoplasm densely granulated, contains some crystals and lipid droplets 1-3 urn
across, tail usually black under low (xlOO) bright field magnification because packed with
refractive fat globules and crystals up to 3 urn long (Fig. 133f)- Food vacuoles about 5 urn
across, likely contain bacterial remnants. Glides, swims or winds slowly on microscope slide
and between soil particles showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability, except for frontoventral row with a
variability coefficient of 15% (Fig. 133a, g-j; Table 115). All cirri conspicuously short and

fine, viz., about 7 urn long in vivo and composed of only two (some frontoventral and
posterior marginal cirri) or four cilia. Marginal rows extend to near body end, right row
commences near distalmost adoral membranelle with the first two cirri frequently set off by a
slightly increased distance; thus, these could be frontoterminal cirri which are, however,
lacking according to the ontogenetic data of HEMBERGER (1982). Frontal cirri in slightly
concave, transverse or oblique line, first frontal cirrus in gap between frontal and ventral
adoral membranelies. Frontoventral cirral row extends slightly obliquely in anterior body
third and is thus distinctly longer than adoral zone of membranelies, but variability is
considerable; cirri form indistinct midventral pattern (pairs) in anterior half of row. Fronto-
terminal (likely), buccal and transverse cirri lacking.

Dorsal bristles 2-3 um long in vivo and widely spaced, invariably arranged in three rows,
well recognizable even in live specimens due to the cortical granules surrounding the
individual bristles; rows 1 and 2 slightly shortened anteriorly. Likely two or three caudal cirri
that are difficult to separate from marginal cirri due to the tail-like body end.
Adoral zone occupies about 20% of body length, composed of 16 membranelles on average,
bases of largest membranelles about 4 urn wide in vivo, anterior (frontal) three membranelles
set off from ventral ones by minute gap; individual membranelles of ordinary fine structure,
anterior row composed of only two or three basal bodies. Buccal cavity narrow and flat;
buccal lip very hyaline, projects angularly, covering proximal portion of adoral zone. Paroral
and endoral membrane form slightly curved row along posterior half of adoral zone of
membranelles. Paroral membrane short, straight to slightly curved, composed of zigzagging
basal bodies bearing 5 urn long cilia. Endoral membrane almost in line and anteriorly slightly
overlapping with paroral. Pharyngeal fibres of ordinary length and structure (Fig. 133a, g, i, j;
Table 115).
Description of Namibian site (4) population (Fig. 133q-y; Table 115): The
Namibian specimens are highly similar to the Maldivean ones. Thus, only deviating or
supplementary features will be mentioned: (i) size 90-130 x 10-20 urn in vivo, length:width
ratio 7-11:1, on average 9:1 in vivo, and 5.4—11:1, on average 8.8:1 in protargol preparations;
(ii) micronuclei about 3x2 urn; (iii) cortical granules smaller (about 0.5 x 0.4 urn) and less
compact than in Maldivean specimens; (iv) distances between marginal cirri become
distinctly wider posteriorly; (v) similarly to the Maldivean specimens, gap often increased
between the third and fourth cirrus of the right marginal row (22% of 14 specimens investi-
gated), the second and third (39%) or the second and third plus the third and fourth cirrus
(22%); only 17% of the specimens lack this interruption.
Occurrence and ecology: HEMBERGER (1982, 1985) discovered P. lanceolata in
meadow soil from Peru. We found it in highly saline and alkaline (pH 8.6) sandy soil and
plant litter at the coast of the Maldives (North-Male Atoll, Himmafushi; collected by Dr.
Wolfgang PETZ in 1990) and at Namibian site (4), that is, the floodplain of a river. Thus, P.
lanceolata has a broad ecological range and possibly cosmopolitan distribution, although
Laurasian records are not known. However, the species is difficult to identify and thus might
have been confused with other taxa.

3 HEMBERGER (1982, 1985) provided the following measurements (n?) from the Peruvian type population
(likely all from protargol-impregnated cells, WlLBERT's method): length 130 urn; width 20 urn; length:width
ratio 6-7:1; body length:length of adoral zone, ratio 4:1; right marginal cirri 30; left marginal cirri 25; frontal
cirri 3; frontoventral row cirri 13; caudal cirri 3; adoral membranelles 15-17; dorsal kineties 3; macronuclear
nodules 15; micronuclei 4-5.

error of arithmetic mean, X - arithmetic mean.
c Including supposed frontoterminal cirri.
Comparison with original description and related species: Periholo-
sticha lanceolata has several specific features (HEMBERGER 1985), all found in the Maldivean
and Namibian specimens: body slenderly lanceolate; a row of frontoventral cirri forming an
587

indistinct midventral pattern in the frontal half; lack of buccal, frontoterminal and transverse
cirri; all cirri composed of only 2-4 cilia; three dorsal kineties. Furthermore, the illustrations
and those morphometrics which are independent of the preparation method are highly similar
in the type population and our specimens (Fig. 133i—1; Table 115). Thus identification is
beyond reasonable doubt, although we cannot entirely exclude the occurrence of fronto-
terminal cirri in our populations. There is only one main feature deviating, viz., the cortical
granules. However, HEMBERGER studied live cells only superficially, if at all, and thus it is
reasonable to assume that he overlooked these colourless and thus inconspicuous granules.
Periholosticha lanceolata is an inconspicuous species easily confused with many other
medium-sized, slender soil hypotrichs, such as Hemisincirra spp., Holostichides spp. (Fig.
133m-p), and Paragastrostyla spp. Thus, protargol impregnation is indispensable for reliable
identification. In vivo, the following combination of features indicates P. lanceolata: size
about 110 x 20 urn, lanceolate; about 15 macronuclear nodules in indistinct series left of
midline; ellipsoidal, colourless cortical granules 0.5-1 urn across around cirri and dorsal
bristles; no buccal cirrus; frontoventral cirral row extends to mid-body, that is, longer than
adoral zone; buccal cavity flat and narrow; about 16 adoral membranelles; three dorsal
kineties.
Periholosticha lacks frontoterminal cirri, according to the ontogenetic data of HEMBERGER
(1982). Thus, P. wilberti SONG, 1990b, which has distinct frontoterminal cirri, belongs to
Holostichides, as already discussed by EIGNER (1994) and FOISSNER (2000a). Likewise,
Paragastrostyla HEMBERGER, 1985 has frontoterminal cirri. Furthermore, the Paragastrostyla
cirral pattern is rather different and the type species has only two dorsal kineties. Thus, it
cannot be identical to our populations.
Afrothrix multinucleata nov. spec. (Fig. 134a—1; Table 116)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 x 20 urn in vivo. Slender with posterior portion distinctly
narrowed. Cortical granules about 1.2 x 0.8 urn, colourless, around cirral bases and dorsal
bristles. Midventral row usually composed of 2 cirral pairs, terminates slightly underneath
adoral zone of membranelles. On average 10 macronuclear nodules forming strand left of
midline, 5 frontal and 8 ventral adoral membranelles, about 44 cirri each in right and left
marginal row, 3 frontal cirri, 2 frontoterminal cirri, 1 buccal cirrus, 4 transverse cirri, and 2
dorsal kineties.
Type location: Litter and Stipagrostis roots from a sand dune between the villages of
Aus and Helmeringhausen, Namibia, 26°05'S 16°35'E (site 17 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective multinucleata refers to the numerous macronuclear
nodules.
Description: Sizel00-200 x 15-30 urn in vivo, usually about 150x20 urn, length:width
ratio 7-8:1 both in vivo and after protargol impregnation (Table 116); dorsoventrally flattened
up to 2:1; very flexible but acontractile. Slender and often slightly curved, widest near mid-
body, anterior portion less distinctly narrowed than posterior often inflated in protargol
preparations (cp. figures 134a, g, j). Anterior end transverse truncate, without distinct process

on ventral side; right body margin with inconspicuous but rather typical indentation at level of
buccal vertex (Fig. 134d, arrow), causing indistinct cephalization. Macronuclear nodules form
strand left of midline, rather variable in number and shape, that is, globular, ellipsoidal (2-
3:1) or dumb-bell-shaped; nucleoli small to large. Micronuclei globular to ellipsoidal,
attached to macronuclear figure in variable positions. Contractile vacuole with two collecting
canals extending to body ends near mid-body at left margin of cell. Cortical granules found
only around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles, ellipsoidal, inconspicuous because of moderate
size (1.2 x Ö.8 urn) and colourless (Fig. 134b, c); do not stain with methyl green-pyronin and
protargol. Cytoplasm colourless, contains many fat globules about 3 fim across. Feeds on
bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates digested in vacuoles 5-7 \im across. Glides slowly on
microscope slide and soil particles.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability, except for number of transverse cirri
which varies strongly (Fig. 134a, f, g, i-k; Table 116). Marginal cirri about 10 urn long in
vivo, fine, that is, usually composed of only four cilia, in posterior body portion often even of
only two cilia (Fig. 134i-l); left and right row end slightly subterminally, anterior portion of
right row extends onto dorsolateral surface. Three slightly enlarged frontal cirri in usual
position. Buccal cirrus at summit of curves formed by paroral and endoral membrane. Five to
ten, usually seven (including frontoterminal cirri) frontoventral cirri composed and arranged
590

as shown in figures 134f, i: four, rarely six of them form two or three midventral pairs,
producing short, inconspicuous midventral row; behind last midventral pair usually a single
cirrus. Transverse cirri protrude distinctly beyond body and thus rather conspicuous in vivo,
although not or only slightly enlarged and longer than marginal cirri (12 jam vs. 10 urn); form
U- or hooked-shaped row near posterior body end; often one or two cirri ahead of transverse
cirri, possibly pretransverse cirri.
Dorsal cilia about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows almost as long as body; bristles in
kinety 2 rather widely spaced. Usually some tightly spaced and transversely arranged bristles
near posterior end of rows, possibly remnants of caudal cirri (Fig. 134h, 1).
Adoral zone of membranelies very short, that is, on average only 15% of body length, with
distinct break in upper half dividing zone in a frontal and ventral portion (Fig. 134a, g, i;
Table 116): frontal portion at upper and right anterior margin of cell, composed of five (rarely
of four or six) minute membranelies; ventral portion begins about 7 urn back from anterior
body end and extends along left body margin, composed of eight membranelles with usual
fine structure. Buccal cavity strikingly small and flat, without lip. Endoral membrane slightly,
paroral distinctly shorter than ventral portion of adoral zone, both curved and likely composed
of closely spaced dikinetids, intersect optically in mid-portion at level of buccal cirrus; cilia
of paroral about 8 urn long in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres prominent in vivo and after protargol
impregnation, of ordinary length and structure, extend obliquely backwards.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, that is, the margin of
the Namib Desert. The species was numerous in the non-flooded Petri dish culture, indicating
that many resting cysts were present. The vermiform body indicates that it is a true terrestrial
ciliate, well-adapted to live in sand. The type species occurred in grassland soil near the
Sheldrick waterfalls in the Shimba Hills Nature Reserve, Kenya (FOISSNER 1999b). Thus, this
genus might be restricted to Africa.
Generic classification and comparison with similar species: Themost
prominent feature of the present species is the bipartited adoral zone of membranelles. Three
genera with this curious feature are known: Afrothrix FOISSNER, 1999b; Erniella FOISSNER,
1987; —> Etoschothrix. The present species is assigned to Afrothrix because the frontoventral
cirri form, as in the type species, a midventral-like pattern, and the ventral membranelles
show the usual fine structure, that is, are composed of two long ciliary rows, one short row,
and one very short row (Fig. 134f, i). By contrast, Erniella has two long ventral cirral rows
and —» Etoschothrix has an Oxytricha-Yike frontoventral cirral pattern. Furthermore, both in
Erniella and Etoschothrix, the ventral adoral membranelles are composed of three ciliary
rows only, namely two long rows and one very short row.
Afrothrix multinucleata differs from the type species, Afrothrix darbyshirei FOISSNER, 1999b,
by the smaller size (110-200 * 15-30 urn vs. 230-330 x 40-60 urn), the lower number of
midventral pairs (usually 2 vs. usually 4) and dorsal kineties (2 vs. 3), and the higher number
of macronuclear nodules (usually 9 vs. 2). Erniella filiformis FOISSNER, 1987 and —»
Etoschothrix terricola are easily distinguished from A. multinucleata by the arrangement and
higher number of macronuclear nodules (17-61 scattered nodules in Erniella filiformis and
Etoschothrix terricola vs. 4-15 nodules forming a strand). In vivo, Afrothrix multinucleata is
thus easily recognized by the vermiform shape, the bipartited adoral zone of membranelles,
and the macronuclear nodules forming a strand left of midline.

Etoschothrix nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Hypotrichida with bipartited adoral zone of membranelles, 1 right and left
marginal row, frontoventral cirri in Oxytricha-Mke pattern, and transverse cirri.
Type species: Etoschothrix terricola nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of Etoscha (large, white place) and the Greek noun thrix (hair =
ciliate s.l.), meaning "a ciliate occurring in the Etosha Pan". Feminine gender.
Systematic position and comparison with related genera: —»
Etoschothrix terricola has, like Erniella filiformis FOISSNER, 1987c and Afrothrix darbyshirei
FOISSNER, 1999b, a very distinctive oral apparatus which, however, probably evolved
convergently, as indicated by the different nuclear and cirral pattern of the three (type)
species mentioned (Fig. 135f-i): many (—> Etoschothrix terricola, Erniella filiformis) vs. two
{A. darbyshirei) macronuclear nodules; frontoventral cirri in Oxytricha-Yike pattern (—»
Etoschothrix terricola) vs. two long, separate ventral rows {Erniella filiformis) or in mid-
ventral pattern {A. darbyshirei); one buccal cirrus (-> Etoschothrix terricola, A. darbyshirei)
vs. many buccal cirri {Erniella filiformis); one row of dorsal bristles (—» Etoschothrix
terricola, Erniella filiformis) vs. three rows {A. darbyshirei); ventral adoral membranelles
each composed of two long rows and one very short row of cilia (—» Etoschothrix terricola,
Erniella filiformis) vs. of ordinary structure, that is, two long rows, one slightly shortened row
and one strongly shortened row {A. darbyshirei). The last mentioned feature shows that
Etoschothrix and Erniella must be far from other hypotrichs because the fine structure of the
adoral membranelles is very conservative.
The right side oral ciliature of —» E. terricola is unique in being composed of a row of very
widely spaced (paroral?) cilia close to a line of very closely spaced (endoral?) kinetids (Fig.
135 1). We never saw such a pattern in any of the 500 hypotrichs we analyzed. However,
details are difficult to recognize and possibly not entirely correct; thus, we did not include this
feature in the genus diagnosis. These peculiarities and the differences detailed above indicate
that Etoschothrix, Afrothrix and Erniella are not confamiliar, in spite of their overall
similarity, especially regarding the bipartited adoral zone of membranelles. Ontogenetic data
are required for a proper classification.
Some early dividers of —>• E. terricola showed that the oral primordium develops apokinetally
underneath the parental oral apparatus and then elongates to the transverse cirri in midline of
body, where a strand of fine fibres extends in morphostatic specimens (Fig. 135f, m; 383h),
very much like in excysting cells of Onychodromus acuminatus (JARENO & TUFFRAU 1979).
Furthermore, 3-4 frontoventral cirral anlagen develop and two of the rightmost frontoventral
cirri are morphogenetically inactive, producing a pattern reminiscent of that found in
oxytrichid hypotrichs, for instance, Urosoma macrostyla (FOISSNER 1983a). A very late
divider showed that the macronuclear nodules fuse and the dorsal kinety divides without
anlagen formation.
Etoschothrix, Afrothrix, and Erniella prefer saline habitats. Likely, they are related to several
marine genera, such as Notocephalus parvulus CORLISS & SNYDER (see redescription by PETZ
et al. 1995) and Holosticha discocephalus KAHL, 1932.
593

Etoschothrix terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 135a-m; 383a-h; Table 117)
Diagnosis: Size about 180x30 urn in vivo, contractile by about 20% of body length; very
elongate elliptical. Cortical granules minute, yellowish, around cirral bases and dorsal
bristles. On average 25 scattered macronuclear nodules, 6 frontal and 21 ventral adoral
membranelles, 33 cirri in left and 40 in right marginal row, 3 frontal cirri, 5 frontoventral
cirri, 1 buccal cirrus, 2 (4?) transverse cirri, and 1 dorsal kinety.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E
(site 61 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin terricola (living in soil) refers to the habitat the species was
discovered.
Description: Size 130-220 x 20-40 jam in vivo, usually near 180 x 30 urn, length:width
ratio 6:1 on average, contractile by about 20% of body length, prepared specimens thus
stouter (about 5:1; Table 117). Slender and occasionally slightly curved, widest from
underneath oral apparatus to mid-body, posterior third more distinctly narrowed than anterior,
slightly to distinctly (contracted specimens) twisted about main body axis, dorsoventrally
flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 135a, d, f; 383a); narrowed body ends inflated and thus indistinct in
prepared specimens, in contrast to spiral body twist, which is maintained. Anterior body end
obliquely truncate and with minute process at upper end of buccal overture. Macronuclear
nodules highly variable in number and shape, globular to distinctly ellipsoidal (3:1), each
usually with a single, large nucleolus; occasionally, some nodules connected by fine strands.
Micronuclei slightly ellipsoidal, usually one each in anterior and posterior third of cell,
compact and thus easy to recognize in vivo. Contractile vacuole with two collecting canals at
left body margin in anterior third of cell, that is, rather close to adoral zone of membranelles.
Cortex bright and thickened in oral area. Cortical granules about 0.7 x 0.4 urn, but distinct
because compact and yellowish; cells, however, colourless because granules restricted to
bases of marginal cirri and dorsal bristles; stain black with protargol, sparse or lacking around
frontal and ventral cirri (Fig. 135b, c, k). Middle third of cell usually packed with colourless
fat globules 1-4 urn across and food vacuoles containing mainly —» Euplotopsis incisa (about
40 x 30 urn) and Homalogastra setosa, which are ingested whole, showing that the narrow
oral opening can considerably extend. Glides rapidly on microscope slide and soil particles.
Cirral pattern of usual variability, while cirral numbers more variable than average (Fig. 135a,
f, i, k; 383a-c; Table 117). All cirri rather thin and short and thus inconspicuous, except for
the slightly enlarged and up to 15 urn long frontal and transverse cirri. Marginal cirri about 12
urn long in vivo, each composed of two ciliary rows. Marginal rows follow spiral twist of
body, right row commences subapically on dorsal side and extends obliquely to transverse
cirri, last cirrus distinctly reduced in size; left marginal row anteriorly more or less distinctly
curved approaching proximal buccal vertex, extends to midline of posterior end, last cirrus
easily misinterpreted as caudal cirrus because distinctly set off from other marginal cirri and
very near to posterior group of dorsal bristles. Three frontal cirri in usual position. Four to
eight, usually six (including buccal cirrus) frontoventral cirri composed and arranged as
shown in figures 135i, k, that is, in Oxytricha-\ike pattern, do not usually extend beyond
proximal buccal vertex, except for those specimens which have seven or eight cirri (Fig. 135j;

Table 117). Transverse cirri about 15 urn long in vivo, project above posterior body end,
usually form two distinct groups, each possibly composed of two closely spaced cirri.
Dorsal cilia about 4 jam long in vivo, arranged in single row commencing subapically near
left body margin and obliquely extending to right posterior body margin, terminating in
midline of posterior body end with two to five, usually four closely spaced, 5-6 urn long
bristles (Fig. 135g; 383e).
Oral area slightly flattened, conspicuous, though occupying only about 20% of body length,
because of its particular organization (Fig. 135a, e, f; 383a-d, f, g; Table 117). Adoral zone of
membranelles with distinct break in upper third, dividing zone into a short frontal and a long
ventral portion. Frontal adoral zone at upper and right anterior margin of cell, ventrally
covered by a flat ridge, usually composed of six short membranelles occasionally forming
two indistinct groups with three membranelles each, cilia about 20 urn long and thus forming
distinct tuft. Ventral adoral zone rather distant from left body margin, extends longitudinally
in right half of flat groove, composed of 21 membranelles on average, elongate elliptical
because widest (about 8 urn in vivo) membranelles near centre of zone, left margin of zone
irregular because neighbouring membranelles of slightly different length; individual
membranelles composed of two long ciliary rows and one very short row attached to right
anterior end. Two distinct fibre systems associated with ventral portion of adoral zone of
membranelles (Fig. 135e, f, i, k, 1; 383b, f): at right many fine, irregularly curved fibres
extending posteriorly to form conspicuous pharyngeal bundle; at left a stiff fibre originates
from the anterior ciliary row of each membranelle and traverses the left half of the membra-
nellar groove, at the margin of which it curves backwards and overlaps with the neighbouring
fibres to form a distinct strand extending into the proximal buccal vertex. Buccal cavity
pocket-like, dorsal margin very near to right end of adoral membranelles; right margin
thickened, forming short process anteriorly and acute vertex posteriorly merging into left
margin of membranellar groove, covers proximal portion of adoral zone more or less
completely, depending on orientation of cell (Fig. 135e).
Right side oral ciliature difficult to analyze. The following details are recognizable in some
excellently impregnated specimens (Fig. 135e, k, 1; 383e, g): near the right margin of the
buccal overture extends a heavily impregnated, more or less distinctly curved line, which is
unstructured in morphostatic cells but composed of closely spaced granules in early dividers
(Fig. 135m), indicating that it consists of very closely spaced dikinetids; short, faintly
impregnated rods extend horizontally from this line. On or very near to this line are 5-15
widely spaced, sharply impregnated granules, which are ciliated, as evident from live
observations and -protargoL impregnation; these granules are well-recognizable ^only in
excellently prepared specimens and if the buccal roof, on which they are located, is parallel to
the focal plane.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in soils from the margin of the Etosha
Pan (Table 4). Obviously tolerates very saline conditions and pH up to 9.
Comparison with related species: There are three species which are very similar
to E. terricola in body size and shape as well as the structure of the adoral zone of membra-
nelles. Erniella filiformis FOISSNER, 1987c, which also inhabits saline soils, has two long
ventral cirral rows and three to six buccal cirri. Afrothrix darbyshirei FOISSNER, 1999b has
only two macronuclear nodules, three dorsal kineties, and a short midventral row composed
of four pairs of cirri. -» Afrothrix multinucleata has the about ten macronuclear nodules
597

arranged in a series and the cortical granules are colourless. Thus, Etoschothrix, Erniella, and
Afrothrix cannot be confused, even in vivo, because the features are very distinct and easy to
recognize.

Parakahliella halophila nov. spec. (Fig. 136a-u; 384a-i; Table 118)
Diagnosis: Size about 90-100 x 35-55 urn in vivo. Ellipsoidal, slightly tapering
posteriorly. 4-8, usually 4-5 macronuclear nodules; 18—48, usually 22-27 adoral membra-
nelles; 1 buccal cirrus; 4-13 (usually 5-7) cirri in right frontoventral row and 2-13 (usually
6-9) cirri in left (postoral) frontoventral row; 2-5, usually 3 caudal cirri; and 4 dorsal
kineties. 1 right and 1 left marginal cirral row.
Type location: Highly saline soil from the coast of the Great Salt Lake in Utah, USA,
near the town of Brigham, 41°30'N 112°W.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words halös (salt) and philos (preferring), referring
to the saline habitats the species occurs in.
598

Description: The three populations studied are fairly similar (Fig. 136m-t; Table 118).
However, it cannot be excluded that they are different species or subspecies. Thus, the data
are kept separate, and the formal diagnosis contains only the American type population
which, however, embraces the major part of the total variability encountered because some
sort of macrostomes developed six days after rewetting the sample (Fig. 136o; Table 118);
accordingly, coefficients of variation are unusually high. The "macrostomes" have, on
average, slightly more adoral membranelles (27 vs. 22) and macronuclear nodules (5 vs. 4).
Furthermore, remnants of marginal rows from the previous generation are more frequent.
Size 80-150 x 30-80 jam in vivo, usually about 90-100 x 35-55 urn, length:width ratio 1.9-
2.4:1 on average in protargol preparations. Shape also highly variable in all populations,
usually ellipsoidal and slightly tapering posteriorly, occasionally fusiform or narrowed tail-
like. Dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1, ventral side flat or concave, dorsal more or less
distinctly vaulted in middle third and with rather conspicuous furrow between kineties 3 and 5
(Fig. 136c, e, f, h; 384a-c, k, 1; Table 118); highly flexible but acontractile. Nuclear apparatus
left of midline. Macronuclear nodules in series, usually broadly ellipsoidal (1.6:1 on average),
outline often irregular, nucleoli small to large. Micronuclei near or attached to macronuclear
nodules, about 3 urn across in vivo and thus inconspicuous. Contractile vacuole with
conspicuous collecting canals slightly above mid-body. Cortex colourless and very flexible,
without specific granules. Cytoplasm with some fat globules 2—4 urn across and few to many
colourless crystals concentrated in posterior third of cell (Fig. 136a, k; 384j). Omnivorous,
feeds on bacteria, brown fungal conidia, flagellates, ciliates {Pseudocohnilembus, Vorticella
astyliformis, and even small specimens its own species), and wheat starch digested in
vacuoles 10-20 urn across. Movement without peculiarities, glides rather rapidly on micro-
scope slide and organic debris, showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri highly variable. Cirri about 13 urn long in vivo, arranged as
shown in figures 136m, o, q, s and 384a-c, k, 1; pattern somewhat population-specific, but
transitions occur, and some specimens of population IV, which have only three postoral cirri,
look similar to an ordinary Oxytricha, except for the absent transverse cirri. Frontoventral
cirri sparse compared to congeners, left of right frontoventral row usually two cirri; invariably
one buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane. Remnants of parental marginal
rows occur only in populations II and III and mainly in posterior half of cell. Lack of
transverse cirri confirmed by ontogenesis in all populations.
Dorsal bristles about 4 urn long in vivo, arranged in four rows, the rightmost of which ends
above mid-body; rarely a parental kinety fragment occurs between rows 3 and 5 (= row 4;
Fig. -1-36r)7 Caudal cirri -conspicuous, usually two to three associated with kinety 1 and one
cirrus with kinety 2 (Fig. 136n, p, r, t; Table 118).
Adoral zone inconspicuous because occupying only 25-36%, on average 31% of body length;
composed of an average of 22-27 membranelles of conventional fine structure, bases of
largest membranelles about 8 urn wide in vivo. Buccal cavity narrow but deep, abuts on
adoral zone of membranelles anteriorly, producing fairly characteristic pattern (Fig. 136a, c,
d, i). Buccal lip projects angularly to cover right half of buccal cavity. Paroral and endoral
membrane slightly curved, in parallel but somewhat diverging posteriorly, both possibly
composed of single line of tightly spaced cilia (Fig. 136i, m, o, q, s; 384k, 1; Table 118).
Pharyngeal fibres of ordinary length and structure.

Meso- and endocyst also about 1 urn thick, very compact and thus refractive, smooth;
followed by an about 2 urn wide, opaque, finely granulated zone indistinctly separate from
main cyst content. Cytoplasm packed with bright fat globules 2—4 urn across and about 1 um-
sized, ellipsoidal inclusions. Macronuclear nodules fused to dumb-bell-shaped or globular
mass in ripe cysts (Fig. 136 1; 384h, i). Cyst wall up to 4 urn thick and often distinctly faceted
in protargol preparations, very likely due to considerable shrinkage (Fig. 384i).
Ontogenesis: Division of Parakahliella halophila is very similar to that of P. haideri
BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989b, and will thus not be described in detail. The oral primordium
develops along the postoral cirri (Fig. 384d), which are incorporated in the opisthe's fronto-
ventral anlagen. Usually, six or seven frontoventral anlagen each develop in proter and
opisthe, including anläge 1, which, as is usual, originates from the primordium for the
undulating membranes. The posterior cirrus of the cirri left of the right frontoventral row
develops two, rarely three anlagen by splitting a primary primordium in the posterior third
602

(Fig. 136b, j). In P. haideri, this cirrus generates only one anläge, while the right fronto-
ventral row produces two streaks (BERGER & FOISSNER 1989b). Only one row of right and
left marginal cirri are generated, as well as one dorsomarginal kinety. No transverse cirri are
produced. Most parental cirri and dorsal kinetids, which are not involved in anlagen forma-
tion, are resorbed. Remnants of the parental marginal cirral rows occur only in populations II
and III, forming the inner right, respectively, outer left marginal row (Fig. 136o, q; Table
118). Parental dorsal kinetids are preserved in populations I, II, and III, albeit rarely, forming
dorsal kinety 4, as in P. macrostoma and P. haideri (BERGER et al. 1985, BERGER & FOISSNER
1989b).

a Data based on mounted, protargol-impregnated (FolSSNER's method), and randomly selected specimens from
non-flooded Petri dish cultures. Measurements in urn. CV - coefficient of variation in %, M - median, Max -
maximum, Min - minimum, n - number of individuals investigated, SD - standard deviation, SE - standard
error of arithmetic mean, X _ arithmetic mean.
b Populations (all in exponential growth phase as evident from many dividers contained in the slides): I - type
population from USA two days after rewetting the sample; II - type population from USA six days after
rewetting the sample; III - Namibian site (59) population; IV - Namibian site (18) population; V - populations
I-IV pooled; VI - Parakahliella haideri (from BERGER & FOISSNER 1989b).
c Includes all postoral cirri that do not belong to the marginal cirral rows.
Occurrence and ecology: The type population was discovered in a soil sample from
a flat, dry puddle at the coast of the Great Salt Lake in Utah (USA). The puddle bottom was
overgrown with halophytes and covered with a salt crust. The sample contained much litter
and plant roots and had pH 8.0. In Namibia, P. halophila occurred at sites (18), (59), and (61),
which are also highly saline. Thus, P. halophila is a euryhaline and very likely cosmopolitan
species.
Comparison of populations and with related species: We studied three
606

populations (I, III, IV in Table 118) of P. halophila from two widely separated regions (USA,
Namibia), and the same population (I, II in Table 118) two and six days after rewetting the
sample. The data show high variability between and within the populations, as evident from a
comparison of the specimens two and six days after rewetting. The two-day-specimens are
rather similar to the Namibian site (18) population (Fig. 136m, s), while the six-day-speci-
mens are highly reminiscent of the Namibian site (59) population (Fig. 136o, q). Thus, we do
not split P. halophila into subspecies, although molecular methods might show that it is a
complex of sibling species.
Parakahliella haideri BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989b (Fig. 136v) differs morphometrically
rather distinctly from P. halophila, although the extreme values often overlap (Table 118).
The best morphometric feature for distinguishing these species is the buccal ciliature: P.
haideri has 1-4, usually 3 buccal cirri, whereas P. halophila has 1-2, usually 1 buccal cirrus.
A much more important feature are the undulating membranes, which optically cross in P.
haideri, while they are invariably side by side in P. halophila (cp. Fig. 136v with Fig. 136u).
This conspicuous difference indicates that P. halophila and —» P. namibicola, described
below, could even be not congeneric with P. haideri and P. macrostoma. This will have to be
proved by sequence data. Parakahliella macrostoma (FOISSNER, 1982) BERGER et al., 1985
(Fig. 136w) is much more densely cirrated than P. halophila and has, like P. haideri, crossed
undulating membranes. Furthermore, ontogenesis shows that it has two left marginal rows
(BERGER et al. 1985). -» Parakahliella binucleata is also more densely cirrated than P.
halophila and has only two macronuclear beads. Furthermore, it has conspicuous cortical
granules. Likewise, —» P. namibicola has only two macronuclear nodules. Fragmocirrus
espeletiae FOISSNER, 2000b (Fig. 136x) also resembles P. halophila, but has (inconspicuous)
transverse cirri and, like P. haideri, usually three buccal cirri.
Parakahliella binucleata nov. spec. (Fig. 137a—j, 382d; Table 119)
Diagnosis: Size about 140 x 50 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. 2 macronuclear nodules. Cortical
granules in dense rows, colourless, about 1 urn across. 27-57, usually 37 adoral membra-
nelles; 1 or 2, rarely 3 buccal cirri; 3-9, usually 5 frontoventral rows; 2-12, usually 4 caudal
cirri on dorsal kinety 1, 1-7, usually 3 on kinety 2, and 1-3, usually 2 on kinety 3; 4 dorsal
kineties. 1 right and 1-6, usually 2 left marginal cirral rows.
Type location: Soil from Etosha National Park, Namibia, 19°10'S 16°10'E (site 64 in
figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective binucleata (two nuclei) refers to the two macronuclear
nodules, a main feature of the species.
Description: Size 120-190 * 35-65 urn in vivo, usually near 140 x 50 urn, length:width
ratio about 2.6-3.4:1 in vivo and 1.7-3.3:1 in protargol preparations, where specimens tend to
become inflated; very flexible but acontractile. Ellipsoidal to slightly fusiform; dorsoventrally
flattened up to 1.5:1, ventral side flat, dorsal distinctly vaulted in posterior half (Fig. 137a, c).
Macronuclear nodules in middle third of cell slightly left of midline, ellipsoidal to elongate
ellipsoidal, with numerous globular nucleoli 1-2 urn across; rather small compared to size of

cell (Fig. 137e). Micronuclei usually attached or near macronuclear nodules, globular, about 5
x 4 urn in vivo. Contractile vacuole in mid-body at left margin. Cortical granules in closely
spaced meridional rows (Fig. 137d, 382d); individual granules inconspicuous because only
1.0-1.3 urn in diameter and colourless, impregnate more or less intensely with protargol and
become bright red, but not released when methyl green-pyronin is added. Cytoplasm
colourless, with many small crystals concentrated in posterior third of cell. Omnivorous,
feeds on long bacterial rods, filamentous cyanobacteria, flagellates (Polytomella), amoebas,
and ciliates (small Colpoda species) digested in vacuoles up to 30 urn across. Movement
without peculiarities, that is, glides moderately quickly on microscope slide and debris
showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri highly variable, as is usual in this genus (Table 119).
Frontoventral and marginal cirri about 12-15 urn long in vivo. Right marginal row
commences at level of right frontal cirrus and ends subterminally. Left marginal ciliature
variable, that is, usually one long row commences slightly above buccal vertex and terminates
at posterior end of cell, plus one or two short to long rows at variable positions left of long
row; some specimens with more than three left marginal rows of rather different length,
609

arrangement, and distances between cirri, possibly remnants of parental left marginal rows
(Fig. 137e, h, i). Frontal cirri distinctly, cirri behind right frontal cirrus slightly enlarged. One
buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane, in about 50% of specimens a second,
rarely a third, buccal cirrus occurs in mid-region of buccal cavity. Number, length, and
arrangement of frontoventral cirral rows highly variable, as in congeners, that is, none of the
patterns can be considered as "representative" (Fig. 137e, h, i).
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in four rows of which the rightmost ends at
or above mid-body25; dorsal ciliary pattern often difficult to recognize due to the cortical
granules. Caudal cirri, although present in considerable number (6-18), inconspicuous in vivo
because of similar size as marginal cirri (Fig. 137f, j; Table 119).

Adoral zone occupies 21-40%, on average 31% of body length, composed of an average of
37 membranelies, bases of largest membranelles about 7 jam wide in vivo. Buccal cavity
narrow and flat. Buccal lip inconspicuous, covers only proximal portion of adoral zone.
Paroral and endoral membrane usually slightly curved and optically crossed in mid-portion
(Fig. 137a, e); exact arrangement of undulating membranes, however, difficult to recognize in
many specimens; both membranes likely composed of a single line of tightly spaced cilia,
paroral cilia about 7 urn long in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres of ordinary length and structure.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and Namibian site (50),
where it showed exactly the same features.
Comparison with related species: The new species is the soleParakahliella with
cortical granules. Only one other species has two macronuclear nodules, viz., -» Para-
kahliella namibicola. Parakahliella macrostoma (FOISSNER, 1982) BERGER et al., 1985 has 5-
13, usually 7-11 nodules (Fig. 136w); Parakahliella haideri BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989b has
5-9, usually 6 nodules (Fig. 136v); and —» P. halophila has 2-8, usually 4 nodules (Table
118). —> Parakahliella halophila specimens with two macronuclear nodules can be easily
distinguished from P. binucleata by the sparse ventral ciliature. Furthermore, P. binucleata is
the sole species with caudal cirri on dorsal kinety 3 (Fig. 137f, j). Paraurostyla weissei
(STEIN, 1859) BORROR, 1972a and P. granulifera BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989a, which have a
very similar general appearance, possess transverse cirri (BERGER 1999).
Parakahliella namibicola nov. spec. (Fig. 138a—j; Table 120)
Diagnosis: Size about 100 x 35 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal. On average 2 macro-
nuclear nodules, 25 adoral membranelles, 1 buccal cirrus, 4 cirri in left frontoventral row, 20
cirri each in middle and right frontoventral row, 5 caudal cirri, and 4 dorsal kineties. 1 right
and 1 left marginal row, and 3 frontoventral rows, of which the middle and right extend
beyond mid-body.
Type location: Sandy bark from an Acacia erioloba (Camel thorn) tree in the Sossus
Vlei, Southern Namib Desert, 24°50'S 15°20'E (site 25 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin composite namibicola (living in the Namib Desert) refers to the
region the species was discovered.
Description: Size 70-120 x 25-45 urn in vivo, usually near 100 x 35 urn, length:width
ratio 1.8-3.9:1, on average 2.7:1 in protargol preparations; very flexible but acontractile
(Table 120). Shape highly variable as shown by figures 138a-g, basically elongate ellipsoidal
with posterior quarter often rather distinctly narrowed and indented at right side, providing
cells with a somewhat sigmoidal outline; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1, invariably
slightly to distinctly twisted about main body axis, marginal cirral rows thus only partially
recognizable when specimens are viewed ventrally. Nuclear apparatus in middle third of body
left of midline. Number of macronuclear nodules varies from one to four, but 85% of the 113
specimens investigated have two nodules; individual nodules broadly to elongate ellipsoidal,
on average near 2:1, outline often irregular, contain many small and some medium-sized
611

nucleoli. Micronuclei not unequivocally recognizable in vivo and protargol preparations, not
even in dividers, one micronucleus is possibly present in some specimens. Contractile vacuole
without distinct collecting canals, in or slightly above mid-body. Cortex colourless and very
flexible, without specific granules. Cytoplasm densely granulated providing cells with a
brownish shimmer at low magnification (< xlOO), contains rather many ordinary crystals
mainly in posterior third, and food vacuoles up to 15 urn across. Benin specimens fed on
naked amoebae and, especially, a Polytoma-Mke flagellate with a size of about 10x6 urn and
a red eye-spot. Glides slowly on microscope slide and between soil particles.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri less variable than in congeners, that is, of almost ordinary
variability (Fig. 138a, e, h, i; Table 120). Cirri 10-15 urn long in vivo, become smaller and
more widely spaced in posterior quarter of all rows. Right marginal row commences dorsally
at level of right frontal cirrus and ends, like left row, subterminally; very rarely specimens
with a short, second left marginal row occur. Frontal cirri slightly enlarged and close together.
Usually one, rarely two or no, buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane, that is,
only about 5 urn away from anterior body end. Number, length, and arrangement of fronto-
ventral rows rather stable, usually as shown in figure 138e. Left frontoventral row
commences underneath right frontal cirrus and ends at level of oral vertex, composed of an
average of only four cirri; rarely some supernumerary cirri occur left of the row. Middle
frontoventral row commences at same level as left row and extends obliquely beyond mid-
body, composed of an average of 20 cirri. Right frontoventral row commences right and at
level of right frontal cirrus and extends obliquely beyond mid-body ending some micrometers
above middle row, composed of an average of 20 cirri. Transverse cirri lacking.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in four rows (five in one out of 30 speci-
mens), of which the two middle rows extend diagonally, mainly due to the spiralization of the
body. Rows 1 and 2 distinctly shortened anteriorly and posteriorly associated with an average
of three caudal cirri, respectively, one caudal cirrus. Row 3 usually distinctly shortened
posteriorly, in 5 out of 23 specimens associated with one or two caudal cirri; row 4 (and 5
occasionally present) near anterior right corner of cell, consists of only few kinetids (Fig.
138i; Table 120).
Adoral zone of ordinary shape and structure, inconspicuous because occupying only 22-32%,
on average 27% of body length, composed of an average of 25 membranelles, bases of largest
membranelies about 7 urn wide in vivo (Fig. 138a, e, h; Table 120). Buccal cavity narrow
compared to size of species and moderately deep; buccal lip rather conspicuous, bears paroral
membrane and projects angularly to cover proximal portion of adoral zone. Paroral and
endoral membrane almost straight and side by side, paroral commences slightly ahead of
endoral and ends a few micrometers above endoral; paroral cilia tightly spaced, about 7 urn
long in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres inconspicuous both in vivo and protargol preparations.
Ontogenesis: The slides from the type location contain several dividers showing the
main ontogenetic events and the generic home of the species. Ontogenesis commences with
the production of an oral primordium close to the postoral portion of the long ventral cirral
row 2. Two cirral streaks and a primordium for the undulating membranes are produced by
the oral primordium and one streak each by within-row proliferation of the long ventral rows
2 and 3. Thus five anlagen streaks are recognizable in middle dividers (Fig. 138j). No
transverse cirri are produced. Caudal cirri are generated at the end of dorsal kineties 1 and 2,
which divide as is usual, while kinety 4 originates dorsomarginally.

schematically in (e). h, i: Infraciliature of ventral and dorsal side
and nuclear apparatus of holotype specimen. Parakahliella
namibicola invariably has three frontoventral cirral rows (numbers
1-3), four dorsal kineties (arrowhead marks posterior end of row
3), and is slightly twisted about the main body axis, exposing part
of the right marginal row on both ventral and dorsal side (RMR).
Note the narrow buccal cavity and the paroral and endoral
membrane extending side by side. This pattern is unusual for
Parakahliella, and thus indicates that this species, and -» P.
halophila, might be representatives of a new genus. The buccal
cirrus is near the anterior body end. j: Middle divider with macro-
nuclear nodules fused to a globular mass (not shown). Asterisks
mark the five frontoventral anlagen streaks; arrowheads denote
anlagen in the marginal rows; and opposed arrows mark parental
cirri, showing that proter and opisthe anlagen develop indepen-
dently. AZM - adoral zone of membranelies, BL - buccal lip, BU

613

Occurrence and ecology: Parakahliella namibicola was almost the only, but very
abundant species in the sandy bark sample from an Acacia tree in the dunes of the Namib
Desert, demonstrating the highly clumped distribution. No other species of the genus is
twisted about the main body axis, indicating that body spiralling might be advantageous in
sandy environments. Indeed, Circinella arenicola, a very slender, cephalized hypotrich
discovered in a dune of North America, is also distinctly spiralized (FoiSSNER 1994a).
Likewise, —> Erimophrya arenicola, another hypotrich living in the sand dunes of the Namib
Desert, is twisted about the main body axis.
Comparison with related species: The new species is possibly the sister of -»
Parakahliella binucleata, which also has two macronuclear nodules, but possesses conspicu-
ous cortical granules and several short and long frontoventral cirral rows. Thus, Parakahliella
namibicola and P. binucleata are easily distinguished, even in vivo. No other species of the
genus is twisted about the main body axis. Generally, the cirral pattern of P. namibicola is
less complicated and variable than that of the congeners. The lack of micronuclei is remark-
able, but must be substantiated by further investigations.
There are quite a lot of similar soil hypotrichs, especially amphisiellids, which are easily
confused with P. namibicola. Thus, combined live observation (lack of cortical granules) and
silver impregnation is indispensable for reliable identification. However, if a species has the
following combination of features in vivo, it is likely P. namibicola: body slightly spiralized
and about 100 x 35 urn in size, two macronuclear nodules, no cortical granules, two ventral
cirral rows extending beyond mid-body, several caudal cirri, narrow buccal cavity, and a short
(quarter of body length) adoral zone composed of about 25 membranelies.

Anatoliocirrus ÖZBEK & FOISSNER nov. gen.26
Diagnosis: Parakahliellidae or Oxytrichidae with transverse, caudal and frontoterminal
cirri. Two or more rows each of right and left marginal cirri. All fronto-ventral-transverse
cirral anlagen of proter and opisthe originate by transverse splitting of long primary
primordia. Dorsal kineties generated by within anlagen and dorsomarginally.
Type species: Anatoliocirruscaparinov. spec.
26 This ciliate was discovered by FOISSNER in Namibia and in a Mangrove swamp in Costa Rica. Later,
FOISSNER found it in a saline wetland soil from Turkey. The Turkish population was cultivated and investigated
by Miss Sirma ÖZBEK during a stay in Salzburg. Unfortunately, she could not finish the work. Thus and because
the species occurs in Namibia, we include it in the present monograph, with ÖZBEK & FOISSNER as authors.
Most illustrations were made by ÖZBEK, while the text was written by FOISSNER.
615

Etymology: Composite of the Latin nouns Anatolia (Turkey) and cirrus (hair, curl ~
compound cilia typical for hypotrichs), meaning a hypotrichous ciliate from Anatolia.
Family classification and comparison with related genera: At first
glance, Anatoliocirrus has distinct morphological and ontogenetical similarities with
Paraurostyla, an oxytrichid sensu lato (WiRNSBERGER, FOISSNER, ADAM 1985), and
Parentocirrus, Parakahliella and Fragmocirrus, which EIGNER (1997) classified in the new
family Parakahliellidae together with Paraurostyla. All these genera have so-called "neo-
kinetal 1" anlagen development in which a V-shaped anläge each develops in proter and
opisthe and produces the rightmost two cirral streaks. In contrast, Anatoliocirrus develops
"neokinetal 3" anlagen, in which a single V-shaped anläge is produced in early dividers; this
anläge grows and splits transversely to produce the two rightmost cirral streaks in both proter
and opisthe (Fig. 139m, p, r, s; 385j-n).
Neokinetal 3 anlagen development is characteristic for the Oxytrichidae (EIGNER 1997),
suggesting that Anatoliocirrus belongs to this family, and the great interphase similarities
with parakahliellids developed convergently. However, there is no soft-bodied oxytrichid
genus, except of Paraurostyla, which looks similar to Anatoliocirrus (for a review, see
BERGER 1999). Thus, and for general reasons we cannot exclude that "neokinetal 3" anlagen
originated convergently in a parakahliellid line, such as Anatoliocirrus. Accordingly, it is
impossible to assign Anatoliocirrus to a certain family, which shows that it is a very distinct
genus.
Table 121. Distinguishing features between Anatoliocirrus and similar genera. Sources see
table 123.

As explained above, the Turkish ciliate seemingly belongs to a group of genera which are
characterized by rather sophisticated features recognizable mainly during cell division,
namely Paraurostyla BORROR, 1972a; Parakahliella BERGER, FOISSNER & ADAM, 1985;
Parentocirrus VOSS, 1997; and Fragmocirrus FOISSNER, 2000b. Thus, the correct assignment
of a new species needs ontogenetic data. Anatoliocirrus differs from the above mentioned
genera mainly by the occurrence of primary primordia (Table 121), a conspicuous feature
used to define families and genera (BERGER 1999, EIGNER 1997). The existence of primary
616

primordia in Anatoliocirrus is proven not only by the general appearance of the cirral streaks,
but also by the lack of any ontogenetically inactive ventral cirri, except of the frontoterminal
cirri (Fig. 139o, p, r, s; 385n). The last mentioned feature is very important because other
genera, especially Paraurostyla, look rather similar in certain division stages, but invariably
have some morphogenetically inactive parental cirri between the proter and opisthe cirral
streaks, even in late dividers (FOISSNER 2000b, WIRNSBERGER et al. 1985). Besides the
primary primordia, Anatoliocirrus differs from the above mentioned genera also in other
features, all compiled in table 121.
Anatoliocirrus capari ÖZBEK & FOISSNER nov. spec. (Fig. 139a-z, 385a-n ;
Tables 122-124)
Diagnosis: Size about 130 x 50 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal. Two macronuclear
nodules. Cortical granules in narrowly spaced rows, colourless, about 1 urn across. On
average 36 adoral membranelles, three enlarged frontal cirri, one buccal cirrus, one fronto-
ventral cirrus, seven frontoterminal and five transverse cirri, one pretransverse cirrus, two
right and four left marginal rows, and a highly variable number (12-50) of ventral cirri
arranged in three to four oblique, staggering rows. Paroral membrane composed of many
short kineties each comprising three basal bodies. Four dorsal kineties, rows 1-3 bipolar and
with an average of eight caudal cirri, row four terminates near mid-body.
Type location: Highly saline soil from Turkey, Mersin, Silifke, Göksu Delta, Cirba
Region, 36°20'N 33°59'E.
Etymology: Named in honour of the parents of the junior author, viz., Sunay and izzet
CAPAR for the diligence in bringing up their children.
Description (Fig. 139a-h; 385a-i; Table 122): Size 100-150 x 30-55 urn in vivo, usually
about 120 x 50 urn, length:width ratio 2.4-4:1, on average near 3:1 in vivo, slightly stouter in
protargol preparations; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1, ventral side flat, dorsal more or less
distinctly vaulted and with rather conspicuous furrow along dorsal kinety four; very flexible
but acontractile. Shape inconspicuous, that is, elongate ellipsoidal, left margin less convex
than right, both ends moderately broadly rounded; well-fed specimens ellipsoidal or ovoidal
with posterior half inflated and broadly rounded posteriorly (Fig. 139a, d, h; 385b). Macro-
nuclear nodules almost abutting in middle third of cell left of midline, elongate ellipsoidal on
average, with numerous globular and oblong nucleoli. Micronuclei ellipsoidal, near or
attached to macronuclear nodules in various positions. Contractile vacuole near mid-body at
left margin of cell, with two collecting canals extending anteriad and posteriad, pulsates
rarely because of the saline medium. Cortex very flexible, contains many granules in rather
narrowly spaced, somewhat staggering rows; individual granules almost colourless, at best a
yellowish shimmer is recognizable, about 0.8-1 urn across, a row of slightly enlarged
granules along each cirral row (Fig. 139e, h; 385a, c). Cytoplasm colourless, well-fed
specimens dark in posterior half at low magnification due to food inclusions and many up to 6
um-sized crystals. Food vacuoles up to 20 urn across when feeding on bacteria, ingests also
small naked amoeba and ciliates, such as Pseudocohnilembus sp. and Euplotes sp. Moves
moderately fast on microscope slide and soil particles showing great flexibility.

Cirri about 11 um long, except for transverse cirri and cilia of adoral membranelles, being 15
urn long in vivo. Composition of cirri rather variable, a representative example is shown in
figure 139f. Cirral pattern highly variable, mainly due to the strongly varying number of
ventral cirri and left marginal rows (Fig. 139a, b, f, i; 385b, d-f; Table 122). Usually seven,
sometimes eight ventral cirral rows, according to the ontogenetic data: row 1 consists of first
frontal cirrus; row 2 of second frontal cirrus and buccal cirrus; row 3 composed of third
frontal cirrus plus mostly one, rarely two distinctly enlarged frontoventral cirri underneath;
rows 4—7 (8), which occupy the midline region of the cell and contain most of the ventral
cirri, are difficult to number in morphostatic specimens because they are short and staggering.
Usually two right marginal rows: first row commences subapically at level of buccal cirrus
and extends to level of posteriormost transverse cirrus; second row parallel to first row, of
variable length, that is, commences near level of buccal vertex and extends up to level of
pretransverse cirrus; rarely occurs a third, short right marginal row. On average four left
marginal rows usually commencing slightly above buccal vertex and terminating near rear
body end; occasionally one or two anteriorly shortened rows interspersed. Usually one, rarely
two buccal cirri slightly underneath anterior end of paroral. Transverse cirri form oblique row
in midline, slightly enlarged, project from body proper; one to two pretransverse cirri.
Dorsal bristles about 4 urn long in vivo, arranged in four, very rarely five rows (Fig. 139c).
Rows 1 to 3 extend in and left of cell's midline, all slightly shortened anteriorly and associ-
ated with an average of eight caudal cirri posteriorly. Row 4 near right margin of cell,
terminates at mid-body. Row five, if present, left of row four, consist of only few kinetids.
Oral apparatus with two peculiarities described below. Adoral zone of usual structure,
comprises an average of 36 membranelles and occupies 30% of body length in vivo, while
43% in prepared specimens, obviously due to some shrinkage of postoral body portion.
Buccal cavity of ordinary width and deepness, distinctly curved anteriorly in vivo; buccal lip
narrow in anterior half, broad and angularly projecting in posterior (Fig. 139a, b, f, g, i; 385b,
e-i; Table 122). Paroral membrane at right wall of buccal cavity, slightly curved, terminates
distinctly above buccal vertex, extraordinary because composed of oblique rows each
comprising three about 7 urn long cilia (Fig. 139f). Endoral with 10 urn long cilia, com-
mences slightly underneath paroral and extends to near buccal vertex. Left of endoral a row of
comparatively widely spaced and slightly scattered granules, seemingly representing basal
bodies of a third undulating membrane, just as described by GROLIERE in Opisthotricha
monspessulana (now Sterkiella cavicola, see BERGER 1999 for detailed review). However,
careful analysis shows that this row is produced either by the curved endoral cilia or, more
likely, by curved buccal fibres (possibly postciliary microtubule ribbons; see BAKOWSKA &
JERKÄ-DZIÄDÖSZ 1978), the curve Verticesof whichi appear as granules (Fig. 139f, g; 385g-i).
Pharyngeal fibres distinct, extend obliquely to mid-body.
Occurrence and ecology: The sample which contained A. capari was collected on 23
July 1999 in the Göksu Delta at the Mediterranean coast of Turkey (36°20'N 33°59'E). The
area is at sea-level and flooded by the Göksu River mainly in winter time. Minimum
precipitation is in August, maximum in December, annual mean amounts 637 mm. Mean
annual temperature is 19° C with a difference of 20° C between the coldest and warmest
month. Vegetation is sparse and dominated by Phragmites sp., Archonomum sp., Juncus sp.
and Inula chritmoides leaving large spots of bare or grassland soil. The soil of this region are
highly saline brown earths.

The sample consisted of five sub-samples taken in an area of about 100 m2and a depth of up
to 10 cm, including the leaf and grass litter; the aqueous soil extract had a salinity of 15%o.
The sample was air-dried for about four weeks and than treated with the non-flood Petri dish
method, as described by FOISSNER (1987d). Anatoliocirrus capari appeared about one week
after rewetting the sample. Some cells were isolated with a fine pipette and cultivated in 15%o
artificial sea water enriched with pieces of larva of the meal beetle (Tenebrio molitar). This
provided flourishing cultures with many dividers.
Anatoliocirrus capari likely is a cosmopolitan and rather frequent in saline soils because we
found it also in a highly saline mud sample from a river in Namibia and in a Mangrove
swamp in Costa Rica. Some experiments showed that it can be grown at salinities between
0%o and 35%o, that is, in tap water and ordinary sea water. When transferred to new culture
medium, the specimens grow very fast obviously ingesting cells of the meal worms. In
contrast, growth is poor in medium containing squashed wheat grains, that is, bacteria. Forms
globular, smooth-walled resting cysts in old cultures.
Comparison with related species: Anatoliocirrus capari is difficult to identify in
vivo because it belongs to a rather large group of hypotrichs having a very similar size and
overall appearance as well as incomplete ventral cirral rows. However, the following
combination of features, easily recognizable even in live specimens, distinguishes A. capari
from all (Table 123): two macronuclear nodules and more than one right and left row of
marginal cirri each.
Ontogenesis (Fig. 139i-z; 385j-n; Table 124): Oral apparatus. The new oral apparatus
develops as in parakahliellid and oxytrichid hypotrichs (for an overview, see BERGER 1999).
Briefly, an oral primordium originates close to the leftmost transverse cirrus and unites with
primordia formed by the postoral ventral cirri (Fig. 139J-1). This results in a large, fusiform
oral primordium extending from the buccal vertex to the transverse cirri. Interestingly, the
primordium, where new adoral membranelles develop from anterior to posterior, as usual,
remains attached to the transverse cirri until mid-division (Fig. 139r, s). The anterior portion
of the primordium generates (likely 3) cirral anlagen and the anterior portion of the undu-
lating membranes, while the posterior portion of the undulating membranes is probably
produced mainly by the posterior end of the cirral anlagen. The short paroral kineties of
Anatoliocirrus capari originate as in Paraurostyla weissei (BAKOWSKA & JERKA-DZIADOSZ
1978, JERKA-DZIADOSZ 1981). Briefly, a row of dikinetids is formed at the left side of the
undulating membrane primordium; many disorganized basal bodies remain (Fig. 139w).
Then, this dikinetidal row splits longitudinally (Fig. 139x, y): the left portion becomes the
endoral membrane, while the right forms short kineties together with the scattered basal
bodies of the primordium. When the buccal cavity develops, the paroral optically moves over
the endoral intersecting it in mid-buccal cavity. The parental adoral zone of membranelles
remains unchanged, while the buccal area, the paroral and the endoral, as well as the
pharyngeal fibres are reorganized completely. The origin of the "third undulating membrane",
which becomes recognizable only in post-dividers, could not be clarified. However, no
special anläge is formed for this structure, supporting that it is an optical artifact as described
above.
Ventral cirral pattern. Anatoliocirrus capari usually generates seven cirral anlagen streaks.
One or two additional streaks of varying length may occur between anlagen III—VII.
Likewise, the number of cirri generated in the anlagen IV-VII is highly variable (Table 122).

men with few ventral cirri. The main portion of the ventral
cirri is rather disordered and hardly shows any consistent
pattern. Only during ontogenesis it becomes recognizable
that they form three to four staggering rows (Fig. 139t, z).
The arrowhead marks a granule row seemingly belonging
to a third undulating membrane. However, detailed inves-
tigation shows that these granules are likely produced by
the vertices of fibres lining the buccal cavity, j-l: The oral

The oral primordium commences to form adoral membra-
nelles in the right-anterior portion. The parental cirri com-
mence with anlagen formation: anläge I originates from
the dissolving parental undulating membranes, and later
contacts a streak originating from the opisthe's oral pri-
mordium (Fig. 139p, r); anläge II, which grows faster than
the other anlagen, originates from the parental buccal
cirrus plus a streak from the anterior end of opisthe's oral
primordium (arrow marks site where they abut); anläge III
is generated by the parental frontoventral cirrus (i) plus
some basal bodies from the opisthe's oral primordium; all
n further anlagen (FV-VIII) originate from parental ventral
cirral rows. I—III - cirral anlagen, AZM - adoral zone of

(EIGNER 1997). q: Dorsal ciliary rows 1-3 originate by

The opisthe's adoral zone of membranelles is almost com-
plete. The primary primordia split transversely to form
secondary primordia, that is, a set of six to eight anlagen
each in proter and opisthe. Disordered basal bodies, which
will become the opisthe's and prater's paroral and endoral,
extend along the adoral membranellar zones; the parental
adoral zone is not reorganized. New frontal cirri become
visible in both daughter cells (asterisks). The marginal
rows, except of the second right row, reproduce by two
anlagen each within the parental rows (arrowheads).
Although there are several right marginal rows, only row 1
is ontogenetically active.The other right marginal rows are produced by terminal splitting of the anlagen produced in row 1.

tral cirri and the nuclear appa-

recognizable that the main por-

three to four rows (connected by
dots). About 30% of the newly
formed ventral cirri will be re-
duced in post-dividers (Table
124), as are parental cirri not
involved in anlagen formation

These irregularities produce part of the conspicuous variability of the cirral pattern of
Anatoliocirrus capari. All ventral cirri are involved in anlagen formation, except of those in
the anterior portion of the rightmost ventral row (Fig. 139o, p, r-t, z; 385n), which are thus
highly reminiscent of oxytrichid frontoterminal cirri (BERGER 1999); they are resorbed in late
dividers, and no parental cirri or dorsal bristles are transmitted to the next generation.
Anatoliocirrus is unique in developing long primary primordia (cirral anlagen), which form
an extremely conspicuous, fan-like array of anlagen streaks in early and early-middle dividers
(Fig. 139m-p; 385j, n). Later, the primary primordia split transversely in the middle,
producing seven to eight secondary primordia, that is, cirral anlagen each in proter and
opisthe (Fig. 139r, s). When ontogenesis is almost completed, cirral streaks IV-VII com-
mence to migrate anteriorly and posteriorly, producing the irregular pattern so typical for the
interphase specimens (Fig. 139t, z).
Anlage (primary primordium) I is produced by the dissolving parental undulating membranes
and later contacts a streak originating from the opisthe's oral primordium. Anlage (primary
626

primordium) II is produced by the parental buccal cirrus and unites with an extraordinarily
long streak produced from the anterior end of the oral primordium. Anlage (primary
primordium) III is produced from the parental frontoventral cirrus underneath frontal cirrus 3
and a streak very likely also originating from the opisthe's oral primordium; however, we
cannot exclude that this anläge also includes some ventral cirri. Anlagen (primary primordia)
IV to VII all are generated from the ventral cirral rows (Fig. 1391—p; 385j-n).
When cytokinesis commences, proter and opisthe anlagen IV-VII each produce a transverse
cirrus by splitting off the last cirrus of the streak; the rightmost anläge leaves 2-3 cirri to
generate one to three transverse and one to two pretransverse cirri (Fig. 139t, z). Subse-
quently, the newly formed cirral streaks begin to migrate anteriorly and posteriorly, producing
the species-specific cirral pattern. However, the final pattern is obtained only in post-dividers,
where a considerable portion (about 30%) of the cirri is reduced, leaving the interphase
pattern so difficult to interpret (Table 124).
Marginal cirral pattern. In middle dividers, the first right marginal row produces a
primordium each in the anterior and posterior half (Fig. 139r, s). These primordia later split
posteriorly, producing two streaks each, of which the longer right one becomes the new first
right marginal row, while the shorter left one develops the new second right marginal row
(Fig. 139t). In contrast, all left marginal rows produce an anläge each anteriorly and posteri-
orly. Furthermore, anlagen splitting, as described for the right row, occurs very likely too and
explains the high variability in row number and number of cirri within rows (Fig. 139s-u).
Dorsal infraciliature. A primordium each develops within the proter and opisthe parental
ciliary rows 1-3 (Fig. 139q, v). Row four originates dorsomarginally, that is, close to the
outer marginal cirral primordium (Fig. 139t). This row migrates dorsolaterally in late
dividers. Caudal cirri are produced in variable numbers only at end of rows 1-3 (Fig. 139v,
z).
Nuclear apparatus. The nuclear apparatus divides as usual, that is, the macronuclear nodules
first fuse to a globular mass, which later divides two times (Fig. 139v, z).

Perisincirra paucicirrata nov. spec. (Fig. 140a-g; Table 125)
Diagnosis: Size about 100 x 20 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal. 2 macronuclear nodules
and 1 micronucleus in between. On average 15 adoral membranelles, 9 cirri in right
(marginal?) row one, and 6 in row two, 7 in left row one and 6 in row two, 1 buccal cirrus,
and 2 cirri behind right frontal cirrus. 3 dorsal kineties with a caudal cirrus each.
Type location: Mud from rock-pools at the bank of the Shoalhaven River near the
village of Bungonia, Australia, 35°S 149°E.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjectives paucus (few) and cirratus (hairy), referring
to the few, widely spaced cirri.
Description: Size 70-130 x 15-30 urn, usually 90-110 urn long in vivo, only slightly
flattened dorsoventrally; length:width ratio about 5:1 in vivo and 2.2-8.6, on average 4.1:1 in
protargol preparations. Elongate ellipsoidal with margins slightly converging posteriorly; very
flexible but acontractile (Fig. 140a-c; Table 125). Macronuclear nodules left of midline in
middle body third, usually elongate ellipsoidal, rarely ellipsoidal or even globular; nucleoli
small to large. Micronucleus (about 3 x2 urn) difficult to recognize both in vivo and
protargol preparations, usually one near or at posterior end of anterior macronuclear nodule
and thus more or less distinctly between the two beads. Contractile vacuole without conspicu-
ous collecting canals distinctly ahead of mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules
lacking. Cytoplasm colourless, usually packed with highly refractive fat globules 0.5-3.0 \im
across making cells dark under low magnification (x40-100) and bright field illumination; in
posterior body portion usually some ordinary crystals. Feeds on fungal spores and hyphae.
Swims and glides rather rapidly on microscope slide and debris, showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern rather constant, while cirral number within rows highly variable (Fig. 140a, c;
Table 125). All cirri rather long and conspicuously fine, that is, about 15 urn and composed of
only two or four cilia. Invariably two rows of conspicuously widely spaced (marginal?) cirri
both right and left of midline. Frontal cirri in transverse row, of about same size as other cirri.
Buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral and ahead of endoral. Usually two, rarely three
cirri or only one cirrus behind right frontal cirrus. Transverse cirri lacking. Dorsal bristles
about 4 urn long in vivo, arranged in three sparsely ciliated rows each terminating with an
about 22 urn long, fine caudal cirrus (Fig. 140d, f).
Adoral zone of usual shape and structure, conspicuously short occupying only 11-25%, on
average 18% of body length, composed of an average of 15 membranelles about 5 urn wide in
vivo and of ordinary fine structure (Fig. 140a, c, g; Table 125). Buccal cavity flat and narrow,
right margin forms convex lip partially covering proximal portion of adoral zone and bearing
paroral membrane composed of a 5-6 urn long, straight series of cilia decreasing in length
from 5 urn anteriorly to 3 urn posteriorly; endoral membrane also more or less straight, but
slightly longer than paroral, with which it forms an acute angle. Pharyngeal fibres incon-
spicuous, extend straight backwards.
Observations on Namibian site (64) population: The Namibian specimens
are highly similar to the Australian type, but have only one (vs. two), rarely none (Fig. 140e),
cirrus behind the right frontal cirrus. Furthermore, 20% of the cells have two micronuclei.
628

Occurrence and ecology: The type population was discovered in the black mud of
rock-pools in an Australian river, where it occurred with low abundance (Fig. 140a-d, g). In
Namibia, Perisincirra paucicirrata was rare at sites (64; Fig. 140e, f) and (70), that is, water-
holes. Thus, P. paucicirrata probably prefers semiterrestrial habitats.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: This new
species is likely related to the type of Perisincirra, viz., Perisincirra kahli (GROLIERE, 1975)
JANKOWSKI, 1978, as indicated by the two left and right rows of rather widely spaced, long
and fine cirri (Fig. 140h). Furthermore they agree in the slender shape (we also found a
specimen with a length: width ratio of 8.6:1), the short adoral zone (< 20% of body length on
average), the two macronuclear nodules, and the three dorsal kineties. GROLIERE (1975) did
not mention caudal cirri; possibly he misinterpreted the posteriormost cirri of the ventral rows
because the infraciliature of these slender and fragile species is difficult to analyze.
Perisincirra paucicirrata differs from the type species in body length (64-121 urn, on
average 85 urn vs. 85-160 urn, on average 115 urn after protargol impregnation),
length:width ratio (in protargol preparations on average 4.1:1 vs. 10:1), the lower number of
adoral membranelles (13-17 vs. 18-20), and the lower number of cirri in the rows (4-12 vs.
18-20). Furthermore, the type population of P. paucicirrata usually has two cirri behind the
right frontal cirrus; these are likely lacking in P. kahli, but also in the P. paucicirrata
specimen from Namibia (Fig. 140e). —> Perisincirra longicirrata has six (vs. four) cirral rows
and a more conspicuous oral apparatus because of the higher number of adoral membranelles
(21 vs. 15) and the much deeper and wider buccal cavity.
The four cirral rows and the lack of transverse and midventral cirri assign Perisincirra to the
Kahliellidae TUFFRAU, 1979. Species of the genera Kahliella CORLISS, 1960 (Fig. 140j),
Engelmanniella FOISSNER, 1982 (Fig. 140i), Deviata EIGNER, 1995 (Fig. 140k), and Neo-
geneia EIGNER, 1995 (Fig. 140 1) can be easily distinguished from P. paucicirrata, inter alia,
by the higher number of cirral rows and the more tightly spaced cirri in at least some of the
rows (for review, see EIGNER 1995). In vivo, Perisincirra paucicirrata is thus recognizable by
the long, fine, widely spaced cirri; the small size (around 100 x 20 urn); and the two
macronuclear nodules. Nevertheless, identifications should be checked by protargol
impregnation because there are likely several other, yet undescribed species in all genera
mentioned.

Perisincirra longicirrata nov. spec. (Fig. 141a-e; Table 125)
Diagnosis: Size about 80 x 30 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal to bluntly fusiform. 2
macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. On average 21 adoral membranelies, about
12 cirri each in the three (marginal?) rows right of midline and about 8 cirri each in the three
rows left of midline, 1 buccal cirrus, 1 cirrus behind right frontal cirrus, and 3 caudal cirri.
Cirri widely spaced and fine, but up to 30 urn long.
Type location: Red, hard, sandy soil (pH 7.3) with some litter and roots from the
University Campus in Abomey-Calavi, Benin, 06°27'N 02°21'E.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjectives longus (long) and cirratus (hairy),
referring to the long cirri.
Description: Size 60-100 x 20-40 urn in vivo, usually around 80 x 30 (am, only slightly
flattened dorsoventrally; length:width ratio about 2.8:1 in vivo and 1.8-2.6:1, on average
2.2:1 in protargol preparations, where specimens are usually slightly inflated. Outline
elongate elliptical to bluntly fusiform with anterior region slightly more narrowed than
indistinctly pointed posterior; very flexible but acontractile (Fig. 141a-c; Table 125).
Macronuclear nodules left of midline in central quarters of cell, usually.ellipsoidal, rarely
almost globular or elongate ellipsoidal; nucleoli small and globular. Usually one globular,
compact micronucleus attached to each macronuclear nodule at various positions. Contractile
vacuole without distinct collecting canals near mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules
lacking. Cytoplasm colourless, usually packed with highly refractive fat globules 1-6 urn
632

across, except in buccal field, making cells dark under low magnification and bright field
illumination; crystals sparse or lacking. Feeds on about 10 x 6 ^m-sized heterotrophic
flagellates {Polytoma sp.). Rotates and glides rather rapidly on microscope slide and debris
showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern rather constant, while cirral number within rows highly variable (Fig. 141a, d;
Table 125). Invariably three posteriorly more or less distinctly curved rows of conspicuously
widely spaced (marginal?) cirri both right and left of midline. Frontal cirri 20-30 urn long in
vivo and composed of up to 3 x 4 basal bodies, that is, slightly longer and distinctly larger
than other cirri, which are 15-25 urn (posteriorly also up to 30 urn) long and likely composed
of 2 x 2 or 2 x 3 basal bodies only. Buccal cirrus ahead of endoral and slightly behind anterior
end of paroral membrane. Invariably one cirrus behind right frontal cirrus. Transverse cirri
lacking.

Dorsal bristles about 5 um long in vivo, arranged in four rows (Fig. 14 le). All rows more or
less distinctly shortened anteriorly, rows 1-3 each terminating with a 20-30 urn long caudal
cirrus; row 4 likely a dorsomarginal kinety because ending above mid-body.
Oral apparatus gonostomoid, that is, adoral zone extends straight along left body margin,
performing right bend and slight clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal cavity slightly
above mid-body. Adoral zone occupies 29-44%, on average 37% of body length, composed
of an average of 21 membranelles with bases of largest membranelies up to 5 urn wide and of
ordinary fine structure (Fig. 141a, d). Buccal cavity rather deep and wide and conspicuously
soft; right margin without lip, distinctly curved, extends from left end of frontal scutum to
near proximal end of adoral zone of membranelles. Paroral on right margin of buccal cavity,
almost straight or slightly curved, composed of an 8 urn long series of about 20, in vivo circa
5 urn long cilia; endoral about 10 urn long, begins about 4 urn ahead of paroral and extends to
mid of buccal cavity. Pharyngeal fibres extend obliquely backwards.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and at Namibian site (73).
The species was rare at both sites. The meaning of the extremely long cirri, compared to body
size, is obscure, especially when considering that only 8 urn long cirri are obviously sufficient
for the large —> Amphisiella multinucleata.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: This
species is likely closely related to —> Perisincirra paucicirrata, as indicated by the rows of
widely spaced, long and fine cirri and the caudal cirri at the end of dorsal kineties 1-3. It
differs from both congeners, Perisincirra kahli (GROLIERE, 1975) JANKOWSKI, 1978 (type of
Perisincirra) and -» P. paucicirrata, inter alia, in body shape (ratio of body length to width
about 2.8:1 vs. 4.1-10:1), the number of cirral rows (six vs. four), and the much deeper and
wider buccal cavity making the oral apparatus conspicuous.
The overall appearance of P. longicirrata is reminiscent of Kahliella spp. because of the
rather high number of cirral rows and the gonostomoid oral apparatus. However, Kahliella
species have more closely spaced cirri in at least two of the rows and lack caudal cirri
(BERGER & FOISSNER 1987, EIGNER 1995, HORVATH 1932). Neogeneia hortualis EIGNER,
1995 has also rather widely spaced cirri in most rows; however, it possesses a distinctly
higher number of cirral rows (11-13 vs. 6), only two dorsal kineties (vs. four), and only one
caudal cirrus (vs. three; Fig. 140 1). Parastrongylidium species, which also have a rather
similar size and overall appearance, possess a moniliform macronucleus, more cirral rows
(11-13 vs. 6) and cirri per row, one dorsal kinety, and lack caudal cirri (AESCHT & FOISSNER
1992, FLEURY & FRYD-VERSAVEL 1984). In vivo, Perisincirra longicirrata is recognizable by
the small size (< 100 um), the rather conspicuous buccal cavity and, especially, the six rows
of widely spaced, long and fine cirri. Identifications should be checked by protargol
impregnation because there are several, as yet undescribed similar species and the species is
easily confused with —> Perisincirra paucicirrata.
In Venezuela, we found a rather similar species. However, its cirri and dorsal bristles are
shorter (about 12 urn, respectively, 2.5 urn vs. 15-30 urn, respectively, 5 urn), the paroral is
shorter and composed of slightly wider spaced cilia, and the buccal field is more narrow and
flat. These differences indicate that the African and South American populations are different
at, at least, subspecies level.

Wallackia bujoreani (LEPSI, 1951) BERGER & FoiSSNER, 1989 (Fig. 142a-g,
143a-p; 398 1)
The Namibian site (71) population of W. bujoreani is highly similar to the original description
(LEPSI 1951; Fig. 142d; 398 1) and the redescription by BERGER & FOISSNER (1989a), who
neotypified the species (Fig. 142b, c). Even minor features, such as the slight posterior
shortening of the right marginal row, the anterior shortening of cirral row 4, and the irregu-
larly shaped cytoplasmic crystals are found in the Namibian specimens. Thus, a redescription
is not necessary. There are, however, a few differences and additional observations, which
should be mentioned.
Shape highly variable, as shown in figures 142a, e, f and indistinguishable from that of
Gonostomum affine. Cortex glassy and distinctly crenated along cirral rows; dorsal bristles
about 4 urn long and originating in conspicuous pits (vacuoles?) about 2 urn across (Fig.
142f). Both features are very likely caused by the highly saline environment, as indicated by
the dorsal bristles, which appear as is usual in protargol preparations. A further peculiarity
caused by the high salinity, respectively, the glassy cortex, concerns the cortical granules,
which are, although rather large, almost invisible in live specimens. Fortunately, they
impregnate strongly with protargol. However, in the specimens from the non-saline site (49),
they do not impregnate but stand out as white rods from the brownish cytoplasm. Food
vacuoles 4-5 |im across, contain bacterial residues. Cilia of paroral membrane and most cirri
about 10 urn long in vivo, anterior frontal cirri and caudal cirri about 15 urn long. Transverse
cirri as indistinct as in Corsican neotype population. No elongated dorsal bristles at posterior
body end, which is an important difference to the freshwater species W. schiffmanni
FOISSNER, 1976 (Fig. 142g).
Occurrence and ecology: LEPSI (1951) discovered W. bujoreani in arable soil from
Romania. The neotype population occurred in a sandy, brown soil (pH 4.1) near a stream in
Corsica (BERGER & FOISSNER 1989a). In Namibia, Wallackia bujoreani was found at the
highly saline sites 54, 59, 60, 71, having pH values between 8 and 9, but also in the non-saline
sample from site (49). Thus, Wallackia bujoreani is euryhaline and very likely cosmopolitan,
inhabiting such different biotopes as arable soils and saline steppes.
Ontogenesis: Ontogenesis was studied in the excellently prepared specimens from site
(54). For designation of cirral rows, see figure 143a. As is usual, parental structures are
shown by contour, newly formed ones are shaded black. All stages depicted were seen in at
least two specimens.
Ontogenesis commences with the production of an oral primordium in the barren postoral
area between the left marginal row and frontoventral cirral row 4. No parental cirri are
involved (Fig. 143b). Next, adoral membranelies develop within the oral primordium from
anterior to posterior and two anlagen streaks originate from the right anterior end of the oral
primordium; these streaks, which still consist of few dikinetids, extend up to the level of
proter's paroral membrane. The left streak is opisthe's anläge I, while the right is anläge III;
anläge II is later produced from anläge I, which transforms into a long primary primordium.
Concomitantly, scattered basal bodies appear between the mid-portion of the adoral zone of
membranelies and frontoventral cirral row 2. These basal bodies contact neither the parental

cirri nor undulating membranes and thus develop de novo (Fig. 143c). Their number increases
rapidly to form a conspicuous streak, which organizes to a long row of oblique dikinetids
becoming proter's anläge I (Fig. 143d-f).
The next stage is characterized by the occurrence of primordia in cirral rows 2 and 3, which
change as a whole to dikinetidal anlagen streaks, and rows 4 and 5, which commence anlagen
formation subequatorially and near anterior end, respectively. Furthermore, the two anlagen
produced by the oral primordium organize to distinct, dikinetidal streaks, of which the left is a
very long primary primordium extending into the proter oral area. Adoral membranelle
formation is almost complete in the oral primordium, and the parental oral structures appear
unchanged (Fig. 143e, f), although the oral area flattens and thus slightly dislocates the
undulating membranes (Fig. 143g, h). The de novo-produced proter anläge 1 separates frontal
cirrus 1 at its anterior end. Anlagen appear intrakinetally in the marginal rows and dorsal
kineties (Fig. 143h, i). Between this and the next stage (Fig. 143j), the very long primordium
(anläge 1) of the opisthe splits: the anterior third becomes opisthe's cirral streak (anläge) II,
while the posterior portion will produce the opisthe's undulating membranes and frontal cirrus
1 (Fig. 143g,h,j,l).
In early-middle dividers, all cirral anlagen are recognizable, while the parental undulating
membranes are still unchanged (Fig. 143j). Proter's anlagen are generated as follows: anläge I
de novo; anlagen II and III develop from parental cirral rows 2 and 3, which change to cirral
primordia as a whole; anlagen IV and V develop intrakinetally in parental cirral rows 4 and 5.
The opisthe anlagen originate differently: anlagen I, II, and III are produced by the oral
primordium, whereby anläge II is generated from a primary primordium splitting trans-
versely"; anlagen IV and V develop intrakinetally in parental cirral rows 4 and 5. Marginal
rows originate as is usual.
In middle dividers, the macronuclear nodules fuse to a globular mass and the parental
undulating membranes disorganize. Most cirri transformed into anlagen, leaving only a few
parental cirri each at anterior and posterior end of the frontoventral cirral rows and in mid
body (Fig. 143k). Next, cirri commence to organize within the anlagen, and the opisthe's
anläge for the undulating membranes splits longitudinally: the right row, which will become
the paroral membrane, produces frontal cirrus 1 (Fig. 143 1). In the proter, new undulating
membranes begin to organize: the endoral very likely develops from parental basal bodies,
while the paroral originates from the posterior part of anläge I, whose anterior portion
produces proter's frontal cirrus 1. Finally, two rows of slightly scattered basal bodies are
recognizable in both proter and opisthe: the left row is the endoral membrane, the right the
paroral (Fig. 143 1, m).
Late and very late dividers show few peculiarities (Fig. 143m-p). However, two important
events occur: (i) the parental adoral zone reorganizes internally because the adoral membra-
nelles lose row 4 and increase length of row 3 (Fig. 143m); (ii) the paroral moves over the
endoral and thus the left row is now the paroral, while the right is the endoral (Fig. 143m, n).
A caudal cirrus is produced at the end of each dorsal kinety (Fig. 143o). Transverse cirri are
not unequivocally identifiable, but, if present, are produced by cirral rows 4 and 5 (Fig. 143n, p).
27 Possibly, a new term should be created because this primary primordium does not produce an anlagen streak
each for proter and opisthe, as is usual, but both parts remain in the opisthe. On the other hand, the second main
feature of a primary primordium, viz., that it splits transversely, is found also in Wallackia.

Ontogenetic comparison and familiar assignment: No previous data are
available on the ontogenesis of Wallackia. Our investigations show several outstanding
features, (i) The adoral membranelles are formed very early in the oral primordium. (ii) Only
five cirral anlagen streaks develop (six in most oxytrichids). (iii) Proter anläge I originates de
novo, while it is generated by the parental undulating membranes in all other stichotrichine
hypotrichs investigated. However, the anläge forms, as in other hypotrichs, frontal cirrus 1
and the undulating membranes, (iv) The opisthe oral primordium, which develops three
anlagen streaks in most (all?) stichotrichine hypotrichs, produces only two streaks. However,
the left streak is a primary primordium generating a third anläge when it splits transversely.

an extraordinarily long primary pnmordium (Fig. 143h). The parental oral apparatus is still almost unchanged, proving that
proter's anläge I originated de novo. Arrowheads mark anlagen in marginal rows. All anlagen (I-V) are now recognizable in
proter and opisthe. In the proter, they were produced as follows: anläge I originated de novo and produced the first frontal
cirrus and the paroral membrane; anlagen II and HI originated from parental cirral rows 2 and 3, which changed to cirral
primordia as a whole; anlagen IV and V originated intrakinetally from parental cirral rows 4 and 5. The opisthe anlagen
originated differently: anlagen I, II and III were produced by the oral pnmordium, whereby anläge II was generated by a
transverse split of a long primary pnmordium; anlagen IV and V originated intrakinetally from parental cirral rows 4 and 5.

This long primary primordium originates from basal bodies of the oral primordium and
elongates to a conspicuous streak by proliferating basal bodies anteriorly and posteriorly. It
produces opisthe's anlagen (cirral streaks) I and II, opisthe's undulating membranes, and
opisthe's frontal cirrus 1.
These peculiarities show that Wallackia is a very distinct genus, although the interphase cirral
pattern looks rather similar to that of Kahliella and Orthoamphisiella. However, Kahliella
lacks caudal cirri and forms at least one of the ventral cirral rows neokinetally, that is, not

from a parental cirral row. Orthoamphisiella also lacks caudal cirri and produces the long
ventral cirral row by a unique process, viz., from a single anläge in the mid of the row
(EIGNER & FOISSNER 1991). We reinvestigated the slides of Gonostomum franzi, which
EIGNER (1997) transferred to Orthoamphisiella and whose interphase cirral pattern is rather
similar to that of Wallackia. This showed that BERGER & FOISSNER (1988b) described
ontogenesis correctly. Orthoamphisiella franzi neither produces proter's anläge I de novo nor
develops a long primary primordium in the opisthe. Accordingly, it does not belong to
Wallackia.
642

The separation of Wallackia FOISSNER, 1976 from Trachelochaeta SRÄMEK-HUSEK, 1954,
whose ontogenesis is unknown because BERGER (1999) transferred Trachelochaeta gono-
stomoida HEMBERGER, 1985 to Gonostomum remains unclear. However, all differences
mentioned by FOISSNER (1976) are still valid, and both type species are very likely represen-
tatives of distinct genera.
The above features make family classification of Wallackia difficult because it is unknown
whether they are significant at genus or family level. The gross ontogenetic pattern of
Wallackia matches the Orthoamphisiellidae, as defined by EIGNER (1997): "The Ortho-
amphisiellidae are unique by producing all cirral rows by within anlagen development, except
those anlagen produced by the oral primordium".
Wallackia elegans nov. spec. (Fig. 144a—h, j—1; 38lr; Table 126)
Diagnosis: Size about 60 x 17 urn in vivo. Lanceolate with narrowed posterior portion
curved rightwards. Two closely spaced macronuclear nodules. On average 3 buccal cirri, 3
cirri in frontoventral row three, 6 cirri in frontoventral row four, 17 cirri in frontoventral row
five, and 3 transverse cirri. Caudal cirri 1/3-1/2 of body length and thus very prominent.
Adoral zone about 46% of body length, composed of 19 membranelles on average. Usually
lOparoral kinetids.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective elegans (elegant) refers to the elegant appearance of the
species.
Description of type population: Size 50-70 x 15-20 urn in vivo, length:width
ratio usually 3-4:1 in vivo and after protargol impregnation (Table 126). Outline lanceolate to
elongate elliptical with narrowed posterior portion usually curved rightwards; right margin
thus often slightly sigmoidal and left convex; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1. Cells
acontractile but flexible and fragile, narrowed end thus usually not recognizable in prepared
specimens (Fig. 144c, d, j). Macronuclear nodules unusually arranged, that is, closely spaced
with posterior nodule very near to left cell margin (Fig. 144a, d, h, k); individual nodules
ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal, contain numerous globular nucleoli. Micronuclei usually
attached to macronuclear nodules, globular. Contractile vacuole without distinct collecting
canals underneath bueeal vertex at left cell margin. No cortical granules. Cytoplasm colour-
less, contains some yellowish, 1-3 um-sized, highly refractive crystals mainly in posterior
body portion. Feeds on bacteria digested in food vacuoles 3-5 urn across. Glides rather
rapidly on microscope slide, occasionally resting for a few seconds.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri rather variable, that is, most variability coefficients > 10%
(Table 126). Most cirri fine because composed of four cilia only (Fig. 144j). Marginal cirri
about 8 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows: right row begins at 10% and terminates at
78% of body length on average, left row terminates near rear end. Three inconspicuously
enlarged frontal cirri arranged in typical Gonostomum-pattem, that is, very near to adoral zone

backwards (Fig. 144c). Invariably four frontoventral rows (numbered 2-5 in figures lc and lj,
as proposed by BERGER & FOISSNER 1989a for W. bujoreani): row 2 (= buccal row) slightly
longer than row 3, which terminates at 21% of body length on average; row 4 slightly
shortened anteriorly, terminates at 38% of body length and is thus somewhat shorter than
adoral zone (46% of body length); row 5 begins subapically, terminates at 91% of body
length and is thus on average distinctly longer than right marginal row. Transverse cirri
difficult to recognize in vivo and even protargol preparations because inconspicuously set off
from posterior end of frontoventral row 5 (Fig. 144c, j); according to a few dividers, they
originate from the posterior portion of frontoventral row 4 (Fig. 144 1).

transverse cirri. In the population from Tenerife, these were included in frontoventral row 5.
d Of 21 specimens analyzed from the type population, two have two, and one has four frontal cirri.
* Of 20 specimens analyzed from the type population, two have four caudal cirri.
Dorsal bristles about 3 um long in vivo, arranged in three rows (Fig. 144d, k; Table 126).
Row 1 distinctly shortened, row 2 slightly shortened, and row 3 almost unshortened
anteriorly; row 3 often with a slightly larger gap between fourth and fifth kinetid; each row
647

associated with a caudal cirrus. Caudal cirri highly conspicuous because 1/3-1/2 of body
length, thicker than all other cirri, and Pasteur pipette-shaped with base about 0.5 urn across;
closely spaced at rear body end, can whip very fast, left and right cirrus each about 20 urn,
middle about 25 urn long in vivo.
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum-pattem (Fig. 144a-c, j; Table 126; BERGER 1999). Adoral
zone occupies 38-54%, on average 46% of body length, composed of an average of 19
membranelles, commences near midline of anterior body end and extends straight along left
body margin, performing abrupt right bend and slight clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal
cavity near left body margin. Bases of largest membranelles about 3 urn wide in vivo.
Proximal portion of adoral zone and buccal cavity almost entirely covered by the curved
buccal lip bearing the paroral membrane, which consists of 9-11 widely spaced, about 5 urn
long cilia. Buccal cavity flat and narrow, at right bordered by endoral slightly longer than
paroral. Pharyngeal fibres clearly recognizable in vivo and protargol preparations, extend
obliquely backwards.
Some dividers show that only five (not six as in most oxytrichids) fronto-ventral-transverse
cirral anlagen are formed (including the anläge for the undulating membranes and the left
frontal cirrus). The posterior cirri of anläge 4 migrate backwards forming the inconspicuous
transverse cirri (Fig. 144 1).
Population from Tenerife: The Tenerife specimens match those from Namibia very
well, both in general appearance and morphometric details (Fig. 144f-h; Table 126). The only
difference worth mentioning concerns the transverse cirri, which are fewer in number (1 or 2)
and thus hardly distinguishable from the marginal and caudal cirri. Furthermore, very slender
specimens occur (length:width ratio 6:1; Table 126).
Occurrence and ecology: We discovered Wallackia elegans in soil from road
puddles and thus cannot exclude that it is a limnetic species. However, the Tenerife28
population, which occurred in an ordinary soil sample, indicates a preference for soil.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: We have
known this distinct, Gonostomum-Mke species with conspicuous caudal cirri for many years.
Now we have sufficient data to describe and classify it properly. According to the gono-
stomoid oral apparatus and the three dorsal kineties and caudal cirri, it could be assigned to
Gonostomum STERKI, 1878 or Wallackia FOISSNER, 1976. However, according to the ventral
cirral pattern, it unequivocally belongs to Wallackia. The pattern is, like in W. schiffmanni
(type; Fig. 142g) and —>• W. bujoreani (Fig. 142a-f), composed of four frontoventral rows,
including a row of buccal cirri. Furthermore, some dividing specimens show that only five
fronto-ventral-transverse primordia are formed, namely one anläge for the undulating
membranes and the left frontal cirrus, and four anlagen for frontoventral rows 2-5. And last
but not least, W. elegans has, like the type species, prominent, Pasteur pipette-shaped caudal
cirri (Fig. 144a, b), a feature only recognizable in live specimens. By contrast, Gonostomum
has a single buccal cirrus and more or less distinctly scattered fronto-ventral-transverse cirri
originating, as in typical oxytrichids, from six primordia. Furthermore, the caudal cirri are
inconspicuous (for review, see BERGER 1999).

Wallackia elegans is easily distinguished from both congeners, W. schiffinanni FOISSNER,
1976 and —> W. bujoreani, by the body shape (lanceolate with short tail curved to right vs.
ellipsoidal), the relative length of the caudal cirri, and the lack of cortical granules. Further-
more, it differs from the limnetic W. schijfmanni by body length (50-70 urn vs. 85-100 urn)
and the lower number of cirri in frontoventral rows two to four (2-5, 2-5, 5-7 vs. 5-7, 5-7,
13). FOISSNER (1976) described 4-6 bristle rows, whereas W. elegans and -» W. bujoreani
invariably have only three. However, a re-evaluation of the original notes showed that
FOISSNER (1976) overinterpreted his data, which are entirely based on in vivo observations.
—» Wallackia bujoreani has conspicuous cortical granules and the fourth frontoventral row,
which is composed of 10-14 cirri, terminates near the rear end (vs. 5-7 cirri and near buccal
vertex in W. elegans).
Gonostomum gonostomoida (HEMBERGER, 1985) BERGER, 1999 has, like Wallackia elegans,
a long frontoventral row left of the right marginal row (Fig. 144i). However, this species,
which was discovered in an infusion of excrements from the terrestrial snail Deroceras
reticulatum, is 110-200 urn long, has only one buccal cirrus, and forms six fronto-ventral-
transverse cirral anlagen. Thus, it is a true Gonostomum.
In vivo, Wallackia elegans is characterized by the following combination of features: body
50-70 urn long; lanceolate with rear portion usually curved to right and bearing very long,
prominent caudal cirri; many ventral cirri in several distinct rows.
Pseudouroleptus caudatus HEMBERGER, 1985
Improved diagnosis: Size about 230 x 50 jam in vivo. Slenderly lanceolate with
posterior portion narrowed tail-like. 2 macronuclear nodules with 1 micronucleus each.
Cortical granules in closely spaced rows, colourless, about 1.2 |im across. Amphisiellid
median cirral row (ACR) extends to near body end and consists of about 56-60 cirri. On
average 45-55 adoral membranelles, 55 cirri in right and near 50 in left marginal row, 1 cirrus
left of ACR, 1 buccal and 1 postperistomial cirrus, 25-50 transverse cirri forming a shortened
or unshortened row right of ACR, and 4 dorsal kineties.
Remarks: The diagnosis is based on HEMBERGER (1985) and the present investigations,
which show that P. caudatus has cortical granules overlooked by HEMBERGER, in spite of
their conspicuousness. However, HEMBERGER obviously did not study live specimens in
detail, although he mentioned "cytoplasm slightly brownish", a feature likely caused by the
dense cortical granulation! Recently, we found P. caudatus in Brazil. It has cortical granules,
emphasizing that they were overlooked by HEMBERGER (1985).
We split the species in two subspecies mainly because of a distinct difference in the number
of transverse cirri, which form a conspicuous, shortened or unshortened row right and along
of the amphisiellid median cirral row, as first recognized by EIGNER & FOISSNER (1994). This
is now a main feature of the genus.
649

Pseudouroleptus caudatus caudatus HEMBERGER, 1985 nov. stat. (Fig. 145a-g;
Table 127)
Diagnosis: Transverse cirral row commences near level of buccal cirrus and extends to
rear body end, composed of about 40-50 cirri.
Type location: Forest soil and Rio Tambopata in Peru (HEMBERGER 1985).
Description (of a population from a rice field soil in Zanzibar): Size 180-280 x 40-60 urn
in vivo, usually near 230 x 50 urn, length:width ratio about 5:1 in vivo, while 4.3:1 on
average in protargol preparations, where specimens are inflated because they are difficult to
stabilize with the usual fixatives (Table 127). Elegant pisciform with tail-like posterior body
portion, a conspicuous feature preserved even in most protargol-impregnated cells; invariably
slightly twisted about main body axis, marginal rows thus never recognizable in full length if
specimens are viewed ventrally (Fig. 145a, d-f); highly flexible and dorsoventrally flattened
up to 2:1, acontractile. Nuclear apparatus in middle body third, left of midline. Macronuclear
nodules distinctly separate, elongate ellipsoidal on average (3:1), contain many small,
globular nucleoli. Micronuclei highly conspicuous in vivo and protargol preparations because
compact and large, that is, about 10x7 urn in vivo (Fig. 145a, e). Contractile vacuole slightly
above mid-body at left cell margin; we did not look for collecting canals. Cortex flexible,
contains closely spaced rows of about 1.2 um-sized granules leaving blank only cirral areas,
provide cells with a brownish colour, although the individual granules are colourless, likely
due to some light refraction (Fig. 145c); impregnate lightly with protargol. Cytoplasm
colourless, packed with food vacuoles; fat globules; minute, protargol-affine granules; and
various crystals up to 5 urn in size which make cells dark in posterior half, where they are
concentrated (Fig. 145a, b). Feeds on coccal cyanobacteria, naked amoebae, flagellates,
diatoms, and small and medium-sized testate amoebae (Trinema lineare, T. enchelys) and
ciliates {Plagiocampa sp., Metopus hasei). Glides vividly on microscope slide and on and
between soil particles showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 145a, d, e; Table 127). Cirri about
15 urn long in vivo, frontal cirri elongated to 20 urn, closely spaced within rows, distances
between individual cirri increase slightly in posterior third of rows. Marginal rows follow
body curvature and are thus distinctly spiralized, extend to posterior body end. Frontal cirri
distinctly enlarged, first cirrus in body midline, third cirrus close to distalmost adoral
membraneile, that is, far subapically at level of buccal cirrus. Invariable one enlarged
frontoventral cirrus underneath frontal cirrus 3, that is, left of anterior end of amphisiellid
median cirral row. Buccal cirrus slightly enlarged, right of anterior portion of undulating
membranes (0-5 urn distant from anterior end). Postperistomial cirrus slightly enlarged, very
near to buccal vertex. Amphisiellid median cirral row ("left ventral row") conspicuous
because composed of an average of 60 cirri, commences at right body margin underneath
distal end of adoral zone and extends obliquely to left body margin to end subterminally on
average. Right of and parallel to amphisiellid median cirral row a series of about 50 trans-
verse cirri (according to ontogenetic data, EIGNER & FOISSNER 1994) forming a ("right
ventral") row commencing at the same level as the amphisiellid median cirral row, but extending
to posterior body end. Dorsal infraciliature poorly impregnated in our specimens, consists of
four kineties and three inconspicuous caudal cirri, according to HEMBERGER (1982,1985).

651

Adoral zone occupies 21-37%, on average 28% of body length, commences far subapically
(18 urn on average), that is, at level of buccal cirrus (Fig. 145a, d; Table 127); composed of
an average of 54 membranelles of ordinary fine structure, bases of largest membranelles 10
urn wide in vivo. Buccal cavity deep and of ordinary width, right half and last adoral
membranelles covered by a very hyaline lip. Undulating membranes slightly curved and side
by side, rarely intersecting optically in posterior third, paroral likely composed of dikinetids.
Pharyngeal fibres distinct in vivo and protargol preparations, extend obliquely backwards.
Occurrence and ecology: HEMBERGER (1985) discovered P. caudatus in Peru, both
in a forest soil and a river. We found it in a grey, sandy, circumneutral (pH 7.8), dry rice field
soil collected by Mag. Hubert BLATTERER in the surroundings of the tourist office of the town
of Zanzibar, East Africa (07°S 39°E). Obviously, this species occurs in both terrestrial and
limnetic habitats. As yet, we have not found it in Laurasia.
Comparison with original description and related species: Our data
match those of HEMBERGER (1985) fairly well, especially if the subspecies -» namibiensis is
included, except for the cortical granules discussed in the "remarks" to the species above.
Specifically, body size and shape, the nuclear and cirral pattern, and main morphometrics are
rather similar (Fig. 145g): body length 230/250 urn; number of adoral membranelles: 40-63,
usually 53/33-50, usually 40; number of cirri in left ventral row (note that HEMBERGER
confused right and left!): 59/55; number of cirri in right ventral row: 50/42.
In vivo, Pseudouroleptus caudatus is easily confused with Hemiamphisiella granulifera
(FOISSNER, 1987c), which has a similar size, nuclear pattern, and cortical granulation, but
lacks the long row of transverse cirri right of the amphisiellid median cirral row.
Pseudouroleptus caudatus namibiensis nov. sspec. (Fig. 146a-c; Table 127)
Diagnosis: Transverse cirral row commences near mid-body and extends to rear body
end, composed of about 25 cirri.
Type location: Soil from margin of a small pond in the Aubschlucht, Namibia, 23°55'S
16°15'E (site 30 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: The new subspecies differs from —» P. caudatus caudatus by the feature
mentioned in the diagnosis. Thus, the description is restricted to the detailed morphometrics
and figures and a few minor details, namely: (i) size 180-330 x 40-60 um in vivo, that is,
slightly larger than —> P. caudatus caudatus; (ii) body never spiralized, a remarkable
difference to —» P. caudatus caudatus and other large soil hypotrichs; (iii) the large, con-
spicuous micronuclei are frequently ovate; (iv) cortical granule rows as distinct as in -• P.
caudatus caudatus and occasionally lightly impregnated with protargol; (v) as in -» P.
caudatus caudatus, the cytoplasm contains innumerable minute, protargol-affine granules
making the analysis of the dorsal infraciliature difficult; (vi) buccal cirrus 5-9 urn, on average
6.3 urn distant from anterior end of paroral membrane; (vii) paroral and endoral frequently
652

intersect optically in posterior half; (viii) an early divider shows a long oral primordium near
the amphisiellid median cirral row and seven cirral anlagen streaks in the opisthe; late
dividers show the amphisiellid median cirral row to be composed of three smaller cirral rows,
as suggested by EIGNER & FOISSNER (1994), based on the details given by HEMBERGER
(1982); the right ventral row (= transverse cirral row) is ontogenetically inactive. These data
match the more detailed observations by HEMBERGER (1982).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rather
abundant.

Comparison with related species: Pseudouroleptus caudatus namibiensis differs
from —> P. caudatus caudatus by the distinctly shortened row of transverse cirri. The feature
is stable and changes the overall cirral pattern rather distinctly. Thus, species rank would
probably be more appropriate. However, the difference is simply based on a quantitative
feature, suggesting subspecies rank, especially since the number of adoral membranelles is
more similar to the South American than East African population of —> P. caudatus caudatus
(Table 127). Recently, we found P. caudatus caudatus in a Brazilean floodplain soil. It
matches HEMBERGER's description, emphasizing that the shortened row of transverse cirri in
P. caudatus namibiensis is a reliable difference.
Pseudouroleptus caudatus namibiensis is easily confused with Hemiamphisiella wilberti
(FoiSSNER, 1982), which has a similar body shape, size, as well as nuclear and cirral pattern
(Fig. 146d, e). However, H. wilberti lacks cortical granules, as confirmed by a reinvestigation
of the type slides and by the Namibian site (3) specimens. Likely, H. wilberti belongs to the
genus Pseudouroleptus, but a transfer should await ontogenetic data.

Amphisiella namibiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 147a, b, h-1; 386a-g, 390f; Table 128)
Diagnosis: Size about 250 x 80 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal. 2 macronuclear nodules
and 2-6 (x = 4) micronuclei. Usually 2 long ventral rows extending to transverse cirri: right
composed of 43, left of 40 cirri on average. On average 50 right marginal, 51 left marginal, 4
buccal, and 5 transverse cirri; 1-6 (x = 4) cirri between buccal row and anterior end of
ventral rows. 3 dorsal kineties. Adoral zone about one third of body length, composed of 44
membranelies on average.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°S 15°50'E
(site 54 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size 140-300 x 40-100 urn in vivo, usually near 250 x 80 urn,
length:width ratio about 3:1 in vivo, while 2.8-6.3:1, on average 4.3:1 in the preparations,
where most specimens are rather distorted (Table 128); very flexible but acontractile. Overall
shape elongate ellipsoidal, slightly narrowed posteriorly, both ends broadly rounded,
dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1 (Fig. 147a, b; 386a, 390f). Macronuclear nodules in middle
third of cell, near or slightly left of midline, ellipsoidal, with numerous nucleoli 1-2 urn
across. Micronuclei usually near or attached to macronuclear beads, globular. Contractile
vacuole with two collecting canals extending anteriad and posteriad near mid-body at left cell
margin. No specific cortical granules. Cytoplasm colourless, without crystalline inclusions,
contains some colourless fat globules 1-5 urn across and about 10-40 um-sized food
vacuoles with residues of ciliates (e.g. Drepanomonas revoluta, Gonostomum sp.). Glides
quickly to and fro on microscope slide.
Pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 147h, j, k; 386a, d, e, 390f; Table 128),
except for buccal cirri (2-5) and cirri left of ventral rows (1-6); in two out of 45 specimens a
third ventral row occurs, and two specimens have some cirri between the anterior portion of
the ventral rows. Marginal cirral rows more or less widely overlapping posteriorly, that is, left
row extends to or above midline at posterior end of cell, while the right row commences
dorsolaterally at level of anteriormost buccal cirrus and extends terminally to, or slightly
above, midline; cirri usually composed of two kineties with six to seven cilia each, anterior-
most cirri of both rows frequently slightly enlarged, that is, consisting of three to five kineties
with five to seven cilia each. Frontal cirri about 25 urn long in vivo, right of midline, right
cirrus close to distal end of adoral zone of membranelies; composed of 8-13 kineties with six
to eight cilia each. Buccal cirri along mid-portion of paroral membrane, anteriormost cirrus
invariably near level of posteriormost frontal cirrus, become slightly thinner from anterior to
posterior; composed of four to seven kineties with six to nine cilia each. Postperistomial cirri
lacking. Ventral cirri about 15 urn long in vivo, arranged in two (rarely three) rows com-
mencing underneath distal end of adoral zone and extending slightly obliquely to transverse
cirri; individual cirri usually composed of two kineties with six to seven cilia each, anterior-
most cirri of both rows frequently slightly enlarged, that is, composed of three to five kineties
with five to seven cilia each. One to six, usually four cirri between buccal row and anterior
portion of ventral rows, usually arranged as shown in figures 147h, j, k, 386d and 390f, but
several variations occur, for instance, cirri may be side by side ("midventral pattern"), or the
left anterior cirrus is absent; cirri slightly enlarged, comprising five to six kineties with five to
656

eight cilia each. Transverse cirri about 25 urn long in vivo, inconspicuously projecting above
posterior body margin, form slightly curved, oblique row at, or slightly left of, midline;
usually composed of six to eight kineties with five to six cilia each. Fibrillar associates of cirri
as shown in figures 147k, 1 and 386b-g; note lack of posterior fibre bundle in transverse cirri
and anteriormost frontal cirrus as well as absence of anterior fibre bundle in buccal cirri.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in three rows slightly shortened anteriorly
and posteriorly (Fig. 147i). No caudal cirri.
Oral apparatus conspicuous because of the large, deep buccal cavity and curved paroral
membrane resembling cyrtohymenid oxytrichids (Fig. 147a, h, j, k; 386d, 390f; Table 128).
Adoral zone occupies about one third of body length, proximal third rather distinctly
broadened and covered by a hyaline cortical process (lip); composed of an average of 44
membranelles, bases of largest membranelles about 20 \im wide. Structure of membranelles
depends on zone region (Fig. 147j): those along buccal cavity composed of two long rows,
one slightly shortened row, and a very short anterior row, which consists of only three basal
bodies; the next 5-8 membranelles have the short anterior row composed of about 10 basal
bodies; membranelles in distal third of zone composed of two long rows and one slightly
shortened row of basal bodies, to which, except for last membranelle, a fairly short row is
attached in mid-portion. Fibrillar system of adoral membranelles also depends on zone region
(Fig. 147k): membranelles of region (a) with short fibre bundle directed to frontal field and
bent dorsally; membranelles of region (b) with short fibre bundle directed to frontal field and
curved dorsally and to the left, likely touching fibre bundle from neighbouring membranelle;
membranelles of region (c) with very long submembranellar fibre bundle originating from left
half of membranelle and extending to proximal end of zone; fibrillar associates of region (d)
like those of region (c), but with fine, straight fibre extending between individual membra-
nelles into buccal cavity; membranelles of region (e) also have intermembranellar fibres, but
all other associates are lacking or inconspicuous.
Buccal cavity deep and wide, with conspicuous accumulation of argyrophilic granules right of
adoral zone and in posterior half of right wall (Fig. 147h, j, k; 386a-d, f). Paroral composed
of closely spaced, about 15 urn long cilia, straight in posterior half, strongly bent leftwards
anteriorly, where it follows curvature of buccal cavity, optically crosses endoral in mid-buccal
area. Endoral membrane posteriorly slightly longer than paroral, so strongly curved that ends
almost touch adoral zone of membranelles, anterior half traverses bottom of buccal cavity.
Both membranes associated with 10-20 urn long fibre bundles, those of paroral line right wall
of buccal cavity, those of endoral line bottom. Pharyngeal fibres surprisingly inconspicuous,
extend obliquely backwards.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at various sites of the Etosha National
Park (Table 4). The large, blunt body indicates that it may be a limnetic species active mainly
during floods. Very recently found in a forest soil of Austria!
Generic classification and comparison with similar species: The
species described resembles Amphisiella GOURRET & R.OESER, 1888 and Lamtostyla
BUITKAMP, 1977a as defined by PETZ & FOISSNER (1996), except for the second ventral row.
Although this is a conspicuous feature, separation at genus level must await ontogenetic data.
Probably, Amphisiella namibiensis, Pseudouroleptus buitkampi (Fig. 147g; FOISSNER 1982),
and P. terrestris (Fig. 147f; HEMBERGER 1985) form a distinct genus.

At species level, Amphisiella namibiensis resembles, due to the long ventral rows, Pseudo-
uroleptus buitkampi (FOISSNER, 1982) BERGER & FOISSNER, 1987 (four macronuclear
nodules, transverse cirri in vertical row; Fig. 147g), P. terrestris HEMBERGER, 1985 (buccal
field inconspicuous, only two to three transverse cirri, ventral rows distinctly shortened; Fig.
147f), Apoamphisiella tihanyiensis (GELLERT & TAMAS, 1958) FOISSNER, 1997d (with
662

postperistomial cirrus and caudal cirri), Apoamphisiella hymenophora (STOKES, 1886a)
BERGER, 1999 (with caudal and postperistomial cirri; Fig. 147d; redescription see GRIMES &
L'HERNAULT 1978), Parentocirrus hortualis VOSS, 1997 (many macronuclear nodules,
caudal cirri present), Holosticha wrzesniowskii (MERESCHKOWSKY, 1878) KAHL, 1932
(marine, adoral zone of membranelles about 50% of body length; Fig. 147c), and Parauro-
styla fossicola (KAHL, 1932) BORROR, 1972a (no cirri between buccal row and ventral rows, a
third ventral row commences at level of buccal vertex, postperistomial cirri present; Fig.
147e).
Amphisiella binucleata (HEMBERGER, 1985) FoiSSNER, 1988
Improved diagnosis: Size about 160-300 x 30-50 urn, usually > 200 urn long in vivo.
Slenderly to very slenderly lanceolate. 2 macronuclear nodules and 3 dorsal kineties. Cortical
granules colourless, inconspicuous and about 1 (am across or in conspicuous clusters
composed of small (about 0.5 urn) and large (up to 3 urn across) globules around bases of
cirri and dorsal bristles. Amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR) extends beyond mid-body,
composed of 22-67 cirri. On average 24-32 adoral membranelles, 42-81 cirri in right
marginal row, 3 cirri left of ACR, 1 buccal cirrus, and 2-3 transverse cirri very near to
posterior body end.
Remarks: The diagnosis is based on HEMBERGER (1985), BERGER & FoiSSNER (1989a),
and the present investigations. We split the species into two subspecies because of distinct
differences in the cortical granules, some main morphometrics, and body shape.
Amphisiella binucleata binucleata (HEMBERGER, 1985) FOISSNER, 1988a nov. stat.
Diagnosis: Posterior body end bluntly pointed. Cortical granules inconspicuous, about 1
urn across. On average 24-25 adoral membranelles, 42-60 cirri in right marginal row, and
22-36 cirri in amphisiellid median cirral row.
Type location: Not given in original description, likely a forest soil near Bonn,
Germany.
Remarks: Diagnosis according to HEMBERGER (1985) and BERGER & FOISSNER (1989a).
Amphisiella binucleata multicirrata nov. sspec. (Fig. 148a—i; Tables 129, 130,131)
Diagnosis: Posterior body portion narrowed tail-like. Cortical granules conspicuous, form
clusters composed of small (about 0.5 urn) and large (up to 3 urn across) globules around
bases of cirri and dorsal bristles. On average 32 adoral membranelles, 81 cirri in right
marginal row, and 67 cirri in amphisiellid median cirral row.
663

Type location: Soil from Aloe dichotoma forest near the Gariganus Guest Farm,
Namibia, 26°30'S 18°25'E (site 5 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of multi (many) and cirri (compound ciliary organelles of
hypotrich ciliates), referring to the high number of cirri and adoral membranelies character-
izing this subspecies.
Description: Size 180-300 x 35-65 urn in vivo, usually about 230 x 50 urn; length:
width ratio about 4.5-5.5:1, in protargol preparations stouter, that is, about 4:1 on average
because very soft and thus more or less inflated due to the preparation procedures (Fig. 148a-
c; Table 129); dorsoventrally only slightly flattened. Elegant pisciform with tail-like posterior
body portion, a conspicuous feature preserved even in most protargol-impregnated cells,
which are lanceolate or clavate; invariably rather distinctly twisted about main body axis,
marginal rows thus never recognizable in full length if specimens are viewed ventrally; very
flexible but acontractile. Macronuclear nodules usually in middle third of cell, ellipsoidal
(2.2:1) to elongate ellipsoidal (3:1), on average 2.6:1; nucleoli numerous and minute.
Micronuclei near or attached to macronuclear nodules, ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal,
conspicuous because about 6-7 x 4-5 urn in vivo; in some specimens inflated to up to 10 um-
sized globules. Contractile vacuole slightly above mid-body at left cell margin, likely with
collecting canals. Cortical granules as described in A. multinucleata, that is, found only
around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles, colourless and globular, occasionally impregnate
with protargol showing a minute, heavily argyrophilic inclusion (Fig. 148f); granules around
cirri 0.8-1 urn across, clusters around dorsal bristles composed of small (about 0.5-1 urn) and
large (up to 3 urn) granules. Cytoplasm colourless, contains many lipid droplets up to 10 urn
across, especially in tail region, which is thus dark at low (< xlOO) magnification. Voracious
predator ingesting bacterial rods, coccal green algae, naked amoebae, heterotrophic flagellates
{Polytomella), and medium-sized ciliates, such as Sathrophilus muscorum, Colpoda maupasi,
and C. cucullus. Prey is ingested whole and rotates for some minutes in the food vacuoles.
Movement conspicuous because slow and serpentine, showing great flexibility between soil
particles; however, can also swim rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri rather variable, as indicated by the high variability
coefficients (Fig. 148a, b; Table 129). Frontal and transverse cirri about 20 urn, other cirri
12-15 urn long in vivo and closely spaced within rows, distances between individual cirri
increase only in posterior portion of marginal rows. Marginal rows follow body curvature and
thus usually distinctly spiralized, extend to near posterior body end, which bears two to four
transverse cirri. Frontal cirri distinctly enlarged, form concave row with third cirrus close to
distalmost adoral membraneile. Usually three slightly enlarged cirri left of anterior end of
amphisiellid median cirral row. Buccal cirrus slightly enlarged, near summit of curve formed
by undulating membranes. Amphisiellid median cirral row conspicuous because composed of
67 cirri occupying 82% of body length on average, commences right of distal end of adoral
zone and extends obliquely to subterminal left body margin.
Dorsal bristles about 4 urn long in vivo, arranged in three rows leaving broad blank stripe in
midline; rows 1 and 2 extend near left body margin and are slightly shortened anteriorly and
posteriorly; row 3 extends along right body margin, anteriorly more distinctly shortened than
rows 1 and 2 (Fig. 148c).
Adoral zone occupies only 15-23%, on average 19% of body length, of usual shape and
structure, except for proximal half, which is widened spoon-like (Fig. 148e); composed of an

a: Ventral view of a representative specimen. This new subspecies is usually longer than 200 urn and very flexible. It differs
from the nominal subspecies mainly by the tail-like posterior body portion and the higher number of adoral membranelles
(25 vs. 32 on average), a rather constant and thus important feature in hypotrich taxonomy, b, c: Infraciliature of ventral and
dorsal side of two different specimens because the holotype specimen (b) is too opaque to see the dorsal side clearly. For
details on the conspicuous oral apparatus, see figure 148d. Note that the specimens are rather strongly inflated due to the
preparation procedures. The holotype specimen (b) has inflated micronuclei. Arrow marks end of the long amphisiellid

Fig. 148d-f. Amphisiella binucleata multicirrata from Namibian
site (5) after protargol impregnation, d: Oral portion of the
specimen shown in figure 148b at higher magnification. The buccal
cavity contains an elaborate fibre system partially shown in this
figure. The most conspicuous part is associated with the undulating I LMR
membranes: a thick fibre originates from the anterior end of the
endoral and splits into a short right branch extending into the frontal
scutum and a long left branch extending backwards to merge into a
fibrous plate originating from the posterior end of the undulating
membranes. This fibre loop is connected to the adoral fibre system
via a fibre formed by the horizontally extending fibres originating
from the adoral membranelles. Further fibres, not shown in this
figure, originate from the paroral membrane and support the ventral
and dorsal wall of the buccal cavity. Amphisiella magnigranulosa,
contained in the same slides, has a very similar oral fibre system,
although it is less conspicuous due to the smaller body size, e:
Scheme of the adoral zo"ne of membranelles, whose proximal
portion is widened spoon-like, f: The bases of the cirri and dorsal
bristles are surrounded by conspicuous granules up to 3 urn across.
Most globules contain a darkly impregnated, minute granule.

and is itself covered by the closely spaced paroral cilia; together,
they form a highly characteristic, crescentic pattern, impressively
shown in the SEM-micrographs of A. multinucleata (Fig. 387a-e).

average of 32 membranelles, bases of largest membranelles 10-12 urn wide in vivo. Buccal
cavity deep and large as in Cyrtohymena, bears complicated fibre system described in
explanation to figure 148d. Furthermore, the large buccal lip and the up to 20 urn long paroral
cilia form a conspicuous, crescentic pattern, as shown in figures 148g, h and the SEM-
micrographs of Amphisiella multinucleata (Fig. 387b—e). Undulating membranes distinctly
curved, close together, optically intersecting near mid of buccal cavity. Pharyngeal fibres very
prominent in vivo and protargol preparations, because mixed with the about 40 urn (!) long
endoral cilia.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, where it was rare, and at
Namibian site (41), where it was rather abundant. Although being large, the species is well-
adapted to the soil environment by the slender shape and soft body. Amphisiella binucleata
multicirrata is a voracious predator often containing several individuals of Colpoda maupasi.
Comparison with related species: Previous (FOISSNER 1982, 1988a) and the
present investigations discovered a group of closely related amphisiellids differing mainly in
the five features compiled in table 131. The Namibian site (5) population is obviously most
closely related to —» A. multinucleata, differing from that species mainly by having only two
macronuclear nodules.
In 1985, HEMBERGER described Uroleptoides binucleata from a soil in Germany. FOISSNER
(1988a) transferred it to Amphisiella. This species obviously belongs to the group character-
ized above. HEMBERGER (1985) used protargol impregnation (Table 130), but studied live
specimens only very superficially, if at all. Thus, it is unknown whether A. binucleata has
cortical granules, which effectively makes the species indeterminable, because, as shown
above, the group contains species with and without cortical granules. However, BERGER &
FOISSNER (1989a) identified a German population with rather inconspicuous cortical granules
and which otherwise matched the HEMBERGER population rather well as A. binucleata (Table
130). Although this identification cannot be proven or disproven, the amended description of
BERGER & FOISSNER (1989a) should be accepted because it is the most parsimonious solution
of the problem.

c Now in genus Lamtostyla, according to ontogenetic data. Possibly, all other species of this list also belong to
Lamtostyla.
The Namibian site (5) population differs more distinctly from A. binucleata binucleata than
the population studied by BERGER & FOISSNER (1989a). Thus, we classify it as a subspecies,
differing from the German populations mainly by the non-overlapping numbers of adoral
membranelles and cirri in the amphisiellid median cirral row. Considering the tailed body,
669

even species status would be appropriate. However, this soft-bodied group of hypotrichs has a
profound variability, and thus it is more honest to classify the Namibian population as a
subspecies at the present state of knowledge. This is emphasized by the population from site
(41), which was analyzed long after the paragraphs above were written. These specimens,
which are well preserved, are even larger than those from site 5 (Table 129), but the cortical
granules are inconspicuous, like those of A. binucleata binucleata, that is, pale (with a minute
compact centre, however) and only 0.4-0.8 urn across.
Amphisiella binucleata multicirrata occurred together with A. magnigranulosa FOISSNER,
1988a at both sites. Although the extreme individuals of both species were difficult to
separate in vivo, most could be easily distinguished, especially in the protargol slides, by the
different length of the amphisiellid median cirral row and the tail-like, respectively, compara-
tively widely rounded posterior body end (Table 130). Indeed, most specimens were highly
similar to those figured in the original description (FOISSNER 1988a). The oral fibre system is
very similar in both species.
Amphisiella procera nov. spec. (Fig. 149a-g; Table 132)
Diagnosis: Size about 170 * 18 urn in vivo, that is, almost vermiform with posterior fifth
narrowed tail-like. 2 macronuclear nodules. Amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR) ends
above mid-body, composed of an average of 15 cirri. On average 20 adoral membranelles, 55
cirri in left and 57 in right marginal row, 3 cirri left of anterior end of ACR, 1 buccal cirrus, 4
transverse cirri, and 2 dorsal kineties which extend along right body margin in posterior body
portion.
Type location: Rare in a soil sample under Aloe dichotoma (Quivertree) in Namibia,
26°25'S 18°20'E (site 7 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective procerus (elongate) refers to the slender body shape.
Description: Size 130-210 x 15-25 urn in vivo, length:width ratio about 9:1 in vivo and
6.1:1 on average in protargol preparations. Outline almost vermiform with posterior fifth
narrowed tail-like in vivo; tail very fragile and thus rarely preserved in protargol preparations
(Fig. 149a, b, e, f; Table 132); trunk dorsoventrally flattened up to 1.5:1. Extremely flexible
but acontractile, often coiled about main body axis by half a turn. Usually two macronuclear
nodules slightly left of midline; individual nodules elongate ellipsoidal, often dumb-bell-
shaped or of irregular outline, with many medium-sized and small nucleoli. Micronuclei
difficult to recognize in vivo and protargol preparations, attached to macronuclear nodules,
conspicuously small (Fig. 149a, c, d, f; Table 132). Contractile vacuole with two collecting
canals slightly above mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules lacking. Cytoplasm
colourless with many lipid droplets 1-3 urn across. Feeds on sporulating bacteria digested in
vacuoles about 7 urn across. Moves slowly and rather clumsily.
Cirral pattern rather constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 149a-f; Table 132).
All cirri about 8 urn long in vivo, fine because usually composed of two or four cilia only
(Fig. 149g). Marginal rows end slightly to distinctly subterminally, right row extends onto
dorsolateral surface anteriorly. Frontal cirri slightly to distinctly enlarged, right cirrus, as is

usual, at distal end of adoral zone. Buccal cirrus slightly behind anterior end of undulating
membranes. Type population usually with three, specimens from Namibian site (9) usually
with four cirri left of anterior end of amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR; Fig. 149b, d, f);
anteriormost cirrus of ACR often slightly enlarged. Amphisiellid median cirral row begins
close to right frontal cirrus and terminates at 30% of body length on average, composed of
two segments of unequal length, often slightly overlapping at level of buccal vertex (Fig.
149d, f). Transverse cirri inconspicuous both in vivo and after protargol impregnation because
of same size as marginal cirri and often close to marginal rows.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in two sparsely ciliated rows. Both rows
commence subapically left of body midline and course obliquely backwards ending at right
posterior margin of cell. Caudal cirri absent (Fig. 149c).
Adoral zone of membranelles occupies only 11-18%, on average 15% of body length, of
usual shape and structure. Buccal cavity deep and moderately wide; anterior portion of right
cavity margin thickened, posterior forms prominent lip covering proximal portion of adoral
zone. Exact structure and arrangement of undulating membranes not clearly recognizable;
paroral and endoral slightly to distinctly curved, almost parallel to each other, paroral cilia
about 5 urn long in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres clearly recognizable in vivo and after protargol
impregnation, of ordinary length and structure, extend obliquely backwards (Fig. 149a, b, d,

b Of 16 specimens analyzed, one had three nodules and one four.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at Namibian sites (7; type location)
and (9). Abundance was very low in both cultures. With its slender body, Amphisiella procera
is well-adapted to live in terrestrial habitats.
Generic assignment and comparison with related species: This species
belongs either to ->• Amphisiella GOURRET & ROESER, 1888 or Lamtostyla BUITKAMP, 1977a
because it has (i) a ventral row likely originating from two rightmost anlagen (Fig. 149d, f),
(ii) more than one cirrus left of the anterior end of the amphisiellid median cirral row, (iii)
transverse cirri, and (iv) lacks caudal cirri (EIGNER & FOISSNER 1994). In the absence of
ontogenetic data, which separate -»• Amphisiella and Lamtostyla (PETZ & FOISSNER 1996), we
assign it to —»• Amphisiella as defined by EIGNER & FOISSNER (1994). Amphisiella procera is
most similar to -» A. binucleata (HEMBERGER, 1985) FOISSNER, 1988a (redescribed by
BERGER & FOISSNER 1989a). It differs from that species in the location of the buccal cirrus
673

(near anterior end of paroral vs. near posterior end or middle portion), cortical granules
(absent vs. present), number of dorsal kineties (2 vs. 3), and the length of the ventral cirral
row (1/3 of body length vs. > 2/3). Further similar, but comparatively very distinct species are
A. magnigranulosa FOISSNER, 1988a (with conspicuous cortical granules) and Lamtostyla
australis (BLATTERER & FOISSNER, 1988), a rather small (length 90-160 urn), elongate
ellipsoidal species with three dorsal kineties (BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1988, FOISSNER 1988a,
VOSS 1992; detailed comparison, see Table 131). In vivo, Amphisiella procera is identified by
the following combination of features: very slender body with distinct tail, two macronuclear
nodules, very inconspicuous transverse cirri, lack of cortical granules and postperistomial
ventral cirri.
Amphisiella elegans nov. spec. (Fig. 150a-d; Tables 133, 134)
Diagnosis: Size about 170 x 35 urn in vivo; narrowly lanceolate and slightly sigmoidal.
Usually 4 macronuclear nodules forming 2 pairs left of midline. Amphisiellid median cirral
row (ACR) ends above mid-body, composed of about 12 cirri. On average 23 adoral
membranelles, about 48 cirri each in right and left marginal row, 3 cirri left of ACR, 1 buccal
cirrus, 4 transverse cirri, and 2 dorsal kineties extending along right body margin in posterior
body portion.
Type location: Soil from Wadi Ram about 10 km east of Al Aqaba, Jordan, 29°30'N
35°E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective elegans (elegant) refers to the elegant appearance of the
species.
Description: This species is highly variable, even in features which are usually constant
in hypotrichs. Thus, we separated specimens with four, respectively, six or more macro-
nuclear nodules in the morphometry (Table 133). However, no clear-cut relationships
emerged because, for instance, specimens with four or six macronuclear nodules may have
three dorsal kineties, but all specimens with three kineties have six or more beads. Further-
more, some observations on other populations show that the Jordanian specimens do not
exhaust the whole range of variability (see below).
Amphisiella elegans is, like several congeners, difficult to preserve. Only if the fixative is
amended with osmium tetroxide, do they stabilize; however, the specimens from Namibian
site (47) even disintegrated in osmium amended STIEVE solution.
Size 140-200 x 25-45 urn in vivo, usually about 170 x 35 urn, length:width ratio highly
variable also in protargol preparations, that is, 3.4-7.6:1, on average 5:1; dorsoventrally
flattened up to 2:1. Outline slender and often slightly sigmoidal with posterior end more
narrowly rounded than anterior; body very flexible but acontractile, often twisted about main
axis by half a turn (Fig. 150a; Table 133). Nuclear apparatus in middle third of cell left of
midline. Number and arrangement of macronuclear nodules highly variable, usually a pair of
nodules each above and below mid-body; in specimens with six or eight nodules, they form a
strand, with one half of the nodules usually still separated from the other by a slightly
increased distance. Of 56 specimens analyzed, 13 have more than the usual four macronuclear
674

nodules, an unusual high percentage (23%) for this kind of hypotrich. Individual nodules
ellipsoidal on average and often connected by a strand of lighter impregnated material;
nucleoli small and numerous. Micronuclei near or attached to macronuclear nodules, about 4
x 3 urn in vivo, number highly variable, especially in specimens with more than four
macronuclear nodules (Table 133). Contractile vacuole with two collecting canals slightly
above mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules lacking. Cytoplasm colourless, contains
many lipid droplets 1-4 urn across, mainly in posterior half of cell. Feeds on small ciliates
{Pseudocohnilembus sp., Colpoda aspera, swarmers of Vorticella astyliformis) and naked
amoebae digested in vacuoles up to 30 urn across. Glides slowly and, although being very
flexible, rather clumsily, possibly due to the twisted body, on microscope slide and soil
particles.
Cirral pattern rather constant, while cirral number unusually variable, especially in specimens
with six or more macronuclear nodules (Fig. 150a, b; Table 133). Most cirri 8-10 urn long in
vivo and rather fine, especially in posterior portion of marginal rows and in median cirral
row. Right marginal row extends onto dorsal side in anterior body quarter and ends far
subterminally, that is, at or above level of transverse cirri. Left marginal row extends onto
dorsal side in posterior body fifth to end terminally in body midline; last cirri easily misinter-
preted as caudal cirri. Frontal cirri slightly enlarged, right cirrus, as is usual, at distal end of
adoral zone. Buccal cirrus near summit of curve formed by paroral membrane. On average
three cirri left of anterior half of amphisiellid median cirral row, which commences close to
the right frontal cirrus and on average terminates at 31% of body length right of cell's
midline; occasionally a distinct break in anterior third of row, showing that it is composed of
at least two segments, as is typical for the group (EIGNER & FOISSNER 1994). Transverse cirri
subterminally inserted, about 12 urn long in vivo, inconspicuous because fine, likely
consisting of only four cilia each.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in two ordinary rows or in three rows with
left row very sparsely ciliated, indicating that it is a remnant of a previous generation (Fig.
150c, d). Both rows commence subapically left of or in body midline and course obliquely
backwards ending at right posterior margin of cell, an unusual and highly constant pattern
found also in several congeners, for instance, —» Amphisiella procera. Caudal cirri lacking.
Adoral zone occupies only 16-23%, on average 19% of body length, of usual shape and
structure, composed of an average of 23 membranelies; frontal scutum possibly unusually
thick because often faintly impregnated. Buccal cavity moderately deep and wide, posterior
cavity margin projects angularly partially covering adoral zone. Paroral and endoral mem-
brane both rather distinctly curved and optically intersecting in mid-portion, likely composed
of dikinetids. Paroral cilia about 1 urn long and very closely spaced forming compact, sail-
like structure in vivo. Endoral cilia at least 15 urn long, beat into the pharynx, form conspicu-
ous bundle with pharyngeal fibres extending obliquely backwards (Fig. 150a, b).
Observations on other populations: We found this or very similar species also in
African soil samples (see occurrence section). Unfortunately, they did not withstand the
preparation procedures, as explained above, and thus we have data only from live observa-
tions. The specimens from Namibian site (51) are only 120-130 urn long, very slender (about
7:1 in vivo), and have minute (< 0.2 urn), colourless cortical granules around the bases of the
cirri and dorsal bristles. Furthermore, they possess some lithosomes about 3 urn across. The
specimens from the highly saline sample of Saudi Arabia are very similar to those from Jordan,

nucleata (Table 134). Considering the high variability of the Jordanian A. elegans, it seems
reasonable to assign these populations to this species.

coefficient of variation in %, M - median, Max - maximum, Min - minimum, n - number of individuals
investigated, SD - standard deviation, SE - standard error of arithmetic mean, X - arithmetic mean.
Occurrence and ecology: The sample from type location, kindly provided by Mag.
Hubert BLATTERER (Linz), contained red sand mixed with litter from shrubs (possibly
678

Chenopodiaceae) and grasses, pH 6.7, salinity < 2%o. While A. elegans was rare at type
location, an abundant population developed in brownish soil mixed with plant litter and rabbit
(?) droppings from the same area. Furthermore, we found A. elegans in a highly saline (21%o)
soil sample collected in Saudi Arabia near the village of Alqasab. Finally, we observed some
specimens at Namibian sites (47) and (51), that is, in bark from Combretum imberbe and
Colophospermum mopane. Thus, Amphisiella elegans is euryhaline and has a broad ecologi-
cal range. In spite of this, we did not find it in about 1000 other samples from terrestrial
habitats collected world-wide.
Generic assignment and comparison with related species: For generic
assignment, see —> Amphisiella procera. Generally, Amphisiella elegans differs from the
quadrinucleate species compiled in table 134 and those mentioned below by the large (length
~ 150 urn vs. < 100 urn after protargol impregnation), slender body (5:1 vs. < 3:1), except of
—> A. longiseries, which has thrice the number of cirri in the amphisiellid median cirral row.
Thus, it is easily identified in vivo. Other quadrinucleate soil hypotrichs belong to different
genera: —>• Terricirra matsusakai BERGER & FoiSSNER, 1989a (oral apparatus differently
organized, green cortical granules; Fig. 388f, g); Hemisincirra quadrinucleata HEMBERGER,
1985 and —> H. namibiensis (ventral cirral row not longer than adoral zone); —> Parakahliella
halophila (four dorsal kineties with caudal cirri, no transverse cirri); Paraurostyla buitkampi
FOISSNER, 1982 (Fig. 147g) and Fragmocirrus espeletiae FOISSNER, 2000b (ventral cirral
rows extend to near transverse cirri, > three buccal cirri and dorsal kineties; rather broad,
massive species; Fig. 136x). Further, care must be taken not to confuse A. elegans with
binucleate congeners and Lamtostyla species, especially L. australis (BLATTERER &
FOISSNER, 1988).

Amphisiella longiseries nov. spec. (Fig. 151a-g; Tables 135, 136)
Diagnosis: Size about 190 x 30 urn in vivo; very slenderly lanceolate. 4 macronuclear
nodules. Cortical granules colourless, 0.5-1.5 um across, in clusters around cirri and dorsal
bristles. Amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR) extends beyond mid-body, composed of about
39 cirri. On average 24 adoral membranelles, about 56 cirri each in right and left marginal
row, 3 cirri left of ACR, 1 buccal cirrus, 4 transverse cirri very near to posterior body end,
and 3 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Sieved litter from bank of Bukaos River, about 80 km north of the town
of Keetmanshoop, Namibia, 25°40'S 18°10'E (site 4 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Latin words longus (long) and series (row), referring to the
long amphisiellid median cirral row.
Description: Two populations were studied. However, since they are from rather distant
locations, namely Namibia (Fig. 151a-e) and Israel (Fig. 15If, g), data are kept separate and
the diagnosis and description contain only observations from the type population. The Israeli
specimens, which were not studied in vivo, are highly similar to the Namibian type popula-
tion, both in morphometry and the rare property that the cortical granules impregnate with
protargol (Fig. 15If, g; Table 135).
Size 160-230 x 25-40 urn in vivo, usually about 190 x 30 urn; length:width ratio in vivo
about 5-7:1, in protargol preparations 3.2-8.1, on average 4.7:1, that is, slightly stouter than
in vivo because more or less distinctly inflated by the preparation procedures (Table 135).
Outline slenderly pisciform with anterior end slightly more broadly rounded than posterior;
rear portion often almost tail-like and curved rightwards, a feature preserved even in most
protargol-impregnated specimens; body very flexible but acontractile, often slightly to
distinctly twisted about main axis (Fig. 151a, d). Macronuclear nodules serially in middle
third of cell slightly left of midline, individual nodules ellipsoidal and with small to medium-
sized nucleoli. Usually one micronucleus attached to anterior and to posterior macronuclear
nodule, posterior micronucleus sometimes between third and fourth nodule; individual
micronuclei ellipsoidal, occasionally pyriform, conspicuous because about 5-6 x 3 urn in
vivo. Contractile vacuole with lacunar collecting canals slightly above mid-body. Cortical
granules as in —» Amphisiella magnigranulosa, —> A. multinucleata, and —» A. binucleata
multicirrata, that is, found only around bases of cirri and dorsal bristles, colourless and
globular, those around bristle rows 1 and 3 usually impregnate with protargol (Fig. 15Id, e),
while granules of row 2 rarely impregnate, possibly due to a preparation artifact because they
impregnate in the Israeli specimens (Fig. 151g). Granules around cirri about 0.5 urn across,
clusters around dorsal bristles composed of small (0.5 urn) and large (up to 1.5 urn) granules
(Fig. 151b, c). Cytoplasm colourless, contains many lipid droplets up to 5 urn across mainly
in posterior body portion, and some food vacuoles with small ciliates (Colpoda maupasi) and
filamentous bacteria. Movement without peculiarities, that is, swims and glides rather rapidly
on microscope slide and debris showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 151a, d, f; Table 135). Cirri short
compared to size of cell, that is, 8-10 urn long in vivo, usually composed of two rows with
four cilia each, closely spaced within rows, distances between individual cirri increase slightly

in posterior portion of marginal rows. Right
marginal row extends onto dorsolateral sur-
face anteriorly, terminates slightly ahead of
right transverse cirrus; left row ends at
about same level or even at top of body.
Frontal cirri distinctly enlarged and longer
than marginal and ventral cirri, form con-
cave row. Usually three cirri left of anterior
end of amphisiellid median cirral row, ante-
rior cirrus behind right frontal cirrus, mid-
dle and posterior cirrus slightly rightwards.
Buccal cirrus at summit of curve formed
by undulating membranes. Amphisiellid
median cirral row conspicuous because
terminating at 70% of body length on aver-
age, commences right of distal end of
adoral zone and extends obliquely to mid-
line in posterior body portion. Transverse
cirri terminal and thus distinctly projecting,
bases not larger than those of marginal cirri.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo,
arranged in three bipolar rows. Caudal cirri
absent.
Adoral zone occupies 14-22%, on average
17% of body length, of usual shape and
structure, except for proximal half, which is
slightly spoon-like widened (Fig. 15Id);
composed of an average of 24 membra-
nelles, bases of largest membranelies about
7 urn wide in vivo. Buccal cavity deep, as
in Cyrtohymena, right margin forms curved
lip covering proximal adoral membranelles
and bearing paroral membrane composed of

cavity. Pharyngeal fibres prominent in vivo
and protargol preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and in the Golan Heights,
Israel (Fig. 15If, g), where it occurred in the upper layer of a moist, dark moder soil of an
uncultivated grassland dominated by Poa sp. (collected on February 14, 1985 by Dr. Johannes
AUGUSTIN, Salzburg). Amphisiella longiseries, which is well-adapted to soil life by the
slender shape, was rare at both sites.
Comparison with related species: This species belongs to the Amphisiella group
whose median cirral row extends beyond mid-body (Table 131). Furthermore, most (all?) taxa
of this group have clusters of cortical granules around the cirri and dorsal bristles. However, they

can be easily distinguished by the number of macronuclear nodules: two in A. binucleata, four
in A. longiseries, eight in A. raptans (Fig. 152h), and 34-38 in A. multinucleata. Some
further, admittedly less conspicuous differences are compiled in Table 136.
Amphisiella longiseries occurred together with A. magnigranulosa FOISSNER, 1988a. Both
could be easily distinguished by the length of the amphisiellid median cirral row (ending
underneath vs. above mid-body) and the number of macronuclear nodules (four vs. two).
Amphisiella multinucleata nov. spec. (Fig. 152a-g, i-m; 387a-e; Table 137)
Diagnosis: Size about 250-300 x 30—40 urn in vivo. Very slender and narrowed
posteriorly. Cortical granules colourless, form clusters composed of small (about 0.5 urn) and
large (up to 3 urn across) globules around cirri and dorsal bristles. Amphisiellid median cirral
row (ACR) extends beyond mid-body, composed of an average of 53-61 cirri. On average
35—48 macronuclear nodules, 30 adoral membranelies, about 90 cirri each in right and left
marginal row, 4 cirri left of ACR, 1 buccal cirrus, 3 transverse cirri, and 3 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective multinucleata (having many nuclei) refers to the
numerous macronuclear nodules.
Remarks: In eight protargol slides from the type locality, we found only six specimens,
including one reorganizer. Furthermore, the impregnation was of mediocre quality because
the fixative had to be amended with osmium tetroxide for better preservation of this fragile
organism. Thus, we could not clarify all details necessary for a perfect description and generic
classification. However, we later found three further populations, whereby the one from
Kenya matches the type material very well in almost all features, so that conspecificity is
beyond reasonable doubt (Fig. 152i-m; Table 137). The Namibian site (52; Table 137) and
Venezuelan (Fig. 387a-e) specimens also agree with the type population in the main features,
such as cirral pattern, oral apparatus including number of adoral membranelles, nuclear
figure, and cortical granulation. However, they are about one third smaller and thus the
number of cirri is lower in the amphisiellid median cirral row and the marginal rows.
Possibly, these populations form a distinct subspecies. Hence, the data are kept separate,
while the Kenyan observations, reported below, are included in the diagnosis.
Description of type population: Size 250-350 x 30-50 urn in vivo, length:width
ratio about 7.7:1 both in vivo and after protargol impregnation (Table 137). Outline very
elongate cuneate with anterior end more broadly rounded than posterior; body very flexible
and slightly to distinctly spiralized about main axis (Fig. 152a, e, f). Macronuclear nodules in
second to fifth sixth of cell, globular, ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal, or even slightly
dumb-bell-shaped, on average ellipsoidal (2:1); nucleoli numerous and minute. Micronuclei
about 4 urn across in vivo. Contractile vacuole with conspicuous collecting canals, distinctly
above mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules around cirri and dorsal bristles,
colourless and globular, occasionally some impregnate with protargol; granules around cirri
usually about 0.8 urn across, those around cirri of amphisiellid median row sometimes larger;

clusters around dorsal bristles composed of small (about 0.5 urn) and large (up to 3 urn)
granules (Fig. 152b-d). Cytoplasm colourless, contains many fat globules 1-3 urn in
diameter. Voracious predator ingesting ci Hates and flagellates {Polytomella) digested in food
vacuoles up to 50 urn across. Movement conspicuous because very slow and serpentine,
showing great flexibility between soil particles.
Cirral and dorsal bristle pattern could not be recognized in every detail (but see Kenyan
population). Marginal cirri about 10 urn long in vivo, that is, short compared to size of cell,
arranged in two rows unshortened posteriorly, right row extends onto dorsal surface
anteriorly. Frontal cirri about 15 urn long in vivo and distinctly enlarged, right one, as is
usual, at distal end of adoral zone. Buccal cirrus close to summit of paroral membrane.
Number of cirri left of anterior portion of amphisiellid median cirral row difficult to recog-
nize due to reasons mentioned above: one specimen unequivocally with only one cirrus, three
specimens very likely with two cirri, and one likely with three. Amphisiellid median cirral
row begins close to distal end of adoral zone and terminates at 71% of body length on
average, composed of about 61 cirri. Transverse cirri terminal, only 15 urn long and thus
inconspicuous in vivo; prominent fibres extend from transverse cirri anteriad. Dorsal bristles
3-4 urn long in vivo, likely arranged in three rows. Caudal cirri lacking (Fig. 152a, f, g).
Adoral zone occupies only 13-18%, on average 15% of body length, of usual shape and
structure, except for proximal half, which widens spoon-like (Fig. 152a, f; Table 137);
composed of an average of 30 membranelles, bases of largest membranelles about 12 urn
wide in vivo. Buccal cavity deep and large, as in Cyrtohymena, right posterior margin forms
inconspicuous lip covering only few proximal adoral membranelles (but see new observations
on a Venezuelan population described below). Undulating membranes distinctly curved and
optically intersecting near mid, roughly as in Cyrtohymena. Pharyngeal fibres very prominent
in vivo and protargol preparations, extend obliquely backwards, likely mixed with long
endoral cilia.
Observations on a Kenyan population (Fig. 152i-m; Table 137): As described
in the occurrence section, Amphisiella multinucleata was found also in a soil sample from
Kenya. The data match well, suggesting conspecificity. Some supplementary observations
and a more detailed morphometric analysis define the species more exactly: (i) cells distinctly
broadened in the protargol slides because some in vivo measurements show that they are as
slender as those from Namibia, viz., 260 x 30 urn, 230 x 32 urn, 230 x 30 um; (ii) morpho-
metrics independent of the preparation procedures match very well, for instance, the number
of adoral membranelles and marginal cirri; (iii) cortical granules, although rather large, easily
overlooked because very hyaline, but occasionally impregnate with protargol; (iv) all in vivo
observations match well; (v) cirri conspicuously short, viz., 8 urn, as in the Namibian
specimens, except the transverse cirri, which are 20 urn long; (vi) there are three to six,
usually four cirri right of the amphisiellid median cirral row and two to five, on average three
transverse cirri in a short, oblique row; (vii) buccal field deep and almost semicircular; (viii)
there are three bipolar dorsal kineties without caudal cirri.
Observations on a Namibian site (52) population (Table 137): Size 140-
210 x 20-35 urn in vivo and thus about one third smaller than type and Kenyan specimens;
length:width ratio around 7:1 both in vivo and after protargol impregnation. Micronuclei
ellipsoidal. Cytoplasm with many fat globules 1-10 urn across and 10 um-sized food
vacuoles containing heterotrophic flagellates. Cortical granulation as in type population.

a Data based on mounted and protargol-impregnated (FOISSNER'S protocol) specimens from non-flooded Petri
dish cultures. The Kenyan specimens were randomly selected, while all five specimens available from the type
population and all usable specimens from Namibian site (52) were analyzed. Data from type population inexact
because of mediocre preparations (see text). Measurements in um. CV - coefficient of variation in %, M —
median, Max - maximum, Min - minimum, n - number of individuals investigated, SD - standard deviation, SE
- standard error of arithmetic mean, X _ arithmetic mean.
b N49 - type population from Namibian site (49), N52 - Namibian site (52) population, KEN - Kenyan
population.
Almost invariably four transverse cirri. Three dorsal kineties easily recognizable in vivo due
to the cortical granule clusters around the individual bristles. Paroral cilia up to 10 jam long
and very closely spaced forming a conspicuous, almost semicircular, plate-like membrane.
Observations on the oral apparatus of a Venezuelan population (Fig.
387a-e): The South American specimens resemble the Namibian site (52) population in most
morphometrics, that is, cells are about one third smaller than those of the type population. The
SEM micrographs show a peculiarity not previously documented, namely, a large plate, likely
the buccal lip, covering the semicircular, Cyrtohymena-like buccal field (Fig. 387b-e;
arrowheads). Obviously, this structure is very hyaline because it was not recognized in vivo.
Furthermore, it is masked by the paroral membrane, whose tightly spaced, up to 10 um long
cilia form a velum of similar size and shape. Further details, see figure explanations.
Occurrence and ecology: In Africa as yet found at type location (Namibian site 49),
where it was very rare, in dung balls formed by a large Scarabaeus (Namibian site 52) with
moderate abundance, and in Kenya (red soil under shrubs and trees in the Escarpment
Mountains near the village of Limuru, surroundings of Nairobi, pH 6.6), where it was
numerous. The Venezuelan population occurred in mosses from a rain forest near the village
of Pavoni, south of Puerto Ayacucho, 05°40'N 67°38'W.

Generic classification and comparison with related species: This large
species is classified in Amphisiella GOURRET & ROESER, 1888 because it lacks caudal cirri
and has more than one cirrus left of the amphisiellid median cirral row (EIGNER & FOISSNER
1994, PETZ & FOISSNER 1996). Amphisiellides FOISSNER, 1988a, Paramphisiella FOISSNER,
1988a, and Hemiamphisiella FOISSNER, 1988a have caudal cirri.
Amphisiella multinucleata is obviously most closely related to A. raptans BUITKAMP &
WlLBERT, 1974 (Fig. 152h). This 300-500 urn long species from a Canadian prairie soil has
only eight macronuclear nodules (vs. more than 26 on average in A. multinucleata) and lacks
cortical granules. However, such granules might have been overlooked by BUITKAMP &
WILBERT (1974), who did not study live specimens in detail. If further investigations show
that A. raptans has cortical granules, A. multinucleata should probably be ranked as a
subspecies with smaller size and distinctly more macronuclear nodules. As concerns the
cortical granules, their pattern and size highly resembles that of —» A. magnigranulosa, which,
however, has only two macronuclear nodules. Paramphisiella acuta (FOISSNER, 1982)
FOISSNER, 1988a, which also has more than 30 macronuclear nodules on average, differs from
Amphisiella multinucleata by the generic characters and the lack of cortical granules (re-
checked in protargol slides), the shorter amphisiellid median cirral row (40% vs. 53-71% of
body length on average), and the distinctly lower number of adoral membranelies (about 15
vs. 28-30) and marginal cirri (45 left and 46 right vs. 69-88 and 72-95 on average). In vivo,
Amphisiella multinucleata is characterized by the following combination of features: large
and slender body (about 175-300 x 25-40 urn; ratio body length:width approximately 7-8:1),
about 26—48 macronuclear nodules, cortical granules around cirri and dorsal bristles,
amphisiellid median cirral row usually extending to posterior third of body.
Amphisiellapolycirrata BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989 (Fig. 153a-d)
Since the original description, we have found this species in terrestrial habitats from Brasil,
Republic of South Africa, Kenya, and Namibia, indicating that it is cosmopolitan. Amphisiella
polycirrata is a conspicuous ciliate differing from A. terricola GELLERT, 1956, its presumed
nearest relative, by body size (> 150 urn vs. < 150 urn), number of buccal cirri (4-8 vs. 1),
and length of ventral cirral row (abutting on transverse cirri vs. more or less distinctly
shortened). As these features are stable, Amphisiella polycirrata is easily identified.
The original description lacks an illustration of a living specimen because "in vivo this
species looks so similar to Amphisiella terricola GELLERT, 1955, that we considered it
unnecessary to draw the living aspect" (BERGER & FOISSNER 1989a). This is confirmed by the
new observations. However, we want to emphasize several features, especially the lack of
cortical granules in all six populations studied, and thus provide a description and a figure of
the live aspect of the specimens from Namibian site (51).
Size about 170-200 x 40-60 urn in vivo. Elongate ellipsoidal (about 4:1) with both ends
broadly rounded in ordinary specimens (Fig. 153a), bursiform when packed with large food
inclusions (Fig. 153b); flattened dorsoventrally up to 3:1. Two ellipsoidal macronuclear
nodules (30 x 15 urn in vivo) in usual position and several conspicuously large (6 urn across)
micronuclei. Contractile vacuole with inconspicuous collecting canals in mid-body. Cortex
691

colourless, very flexible, without specific granules. Cytoplasm hyaline because free of
refractive crystals, but frequently packed with lipid droplets up to 15 urn across postorally,
making cells dark at low magnification (< xlOO). Feeds on small {Cyrtolophosis mucicola)
and medium-sized ciliates (Colpoda), and likely also on heterotrophic flagellates. Moves
rather rapidly on microscope slide and between organic debris, showing great flexibility.
Cirri thick but not exceedingly long, marginal cirri 17 urn, transverse cirri (mostly four) about
23 urn long and hardly projecting from body proper because subterminally located. Six to
eight buccal cirri form conspicuous row in all populations. Ventral cirral row extends to
transverse cirri. Buccal cavity, although rather narrow, conspicuous because deep and
extending to adoral zone of membranelles anteriorly. Buccal lip inconspicuous. About 45-50
adoral membranelles each in Brazilian, South African, and Namibian specimens, while only
35-38 (x = 37) membranelles in the few specimens analyzed from the Madeiran type
population. However, the Madeiran population was weak, and thus such differences are to be
expected.

Since the original description, we have found this species in at least 100 samples from
terrestrial biotopes world-wide; it is also common in Namibia (Table 4). Amphisiella
magnigranulosa is readily identified by its cortical granules, which, however, are easily
overlooked, although up to 3 urn across, because they are colourless and rather hyaline. Thus,
and because there are several similar species with or without granules (Table 131), we
provide several micrographs showing the granules and their arrangement in detail (Fig. 388a-
e).
The cortical granules of A. magnigranulosa are restricted to the ciliature, that is, found only
around the cirri, the dorsal bristles and in the wall of the buccal cavity. The clusters around
the cirri are usually less distinct than those around the dorsal bristles. The buccal granules are
conspicuous and have an intermediate size (~ 1 um). Each granule cluster is composed of up
to fifteen minute (< 1 urn) and one to three large (up to 3 urn, usually 1.5-2.5 urn) granules,
which appear ring-shaped, indicating that they consist of two components of different
refractivity. Although there is some variability in size and number of small and large granules
are mixed, the granule clusters have a very similar pattern and appearance in populations
from all main biogeographic regions. Thus, they are a highly constant and an important
feature.
The nature of the cortical granules of A. magnigranulosa is unknown. On prolonged squeez-
ing, they disappear, that is, are extruded, fading away without forming a coat around the cell.
They do not, or only faintly, stain with methyl green-pyronin, but occasionally impregnate
lightly with protargol.
Nudiamphisiella nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Amphisiellidae with several cirri left of amphisiellid median cirral row, which
originates from the two rightmost anlagen. The rightmost dorsal kinety develops dorso-
marginally. Transverse cirri and postperistomial cirrus lacking.
Type species: Nudiamphisiella interrupta nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective nudus (naked; because of the lack of
transverse cirri) and the generic name Amphisiella. Feminine gender.
Classification and comparison with related genera: Nudiamphisiella is
assigned to the Amphisiellidae because ontogenesis proceeds as in amphisiellids, for
example, Amphisiellides illuvialis EIGNER & FOISSNER, 1994, that is, the median cirral row
originates from the two rightmost anlagen (Fig. 154i). Nudiamphisiella is characterized by
some cirri left of the anterior end of the amphisiellid median cirral row and the lack of
transverse and postperistomial cirri (= cirri behind buccal vertex). This combination of
features separates it from all other amphisiellids (including -» Afroamphisielld), except for
Paragastrostyla, as defined by EIGNER & FOISSNER (1994) and PETZ & FOISSNER (1996).
However, Paragastrostyla HEMBERGER, 1985 lacks a buccal cirrus and dorsomarginal kinety,
and produces the amphisiellid median cirral row from three fragments.

Nudiamphisiella interrupta nov. spec. (Fig. 154a-i; 398k; Table 138)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 x 50 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal. Cortical granules
globular, colourless to yellowish, form widely spaced rows. On average 2 macronuclear
nodules, 27 adoral membranelles, 30 cirri in right and 23 in left marginal row, 14 cirri in
discontinuous amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR), 3 cirri left of ACR, 1 buccal cirrus, 3
caudal cirri, and 4 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin participle interruptus (interrupted) refers to the discontinuous
amphisiellid median cirral row.
Description: Size 120-170 x 35-55 urn in vivo, length:width ratio about 3:1 in vivo and
protargol preparations (Fig. 154a, d-f; Table 138); very flexible but acontractile. Outline
elongate elliptical with anterior end often somewhat obliquely truncated and posterior broadly
rounded; left margin usually more convex than right. Two, rarely four macronuclear nodules
slightly left of midline; individual nodules 20-25 x 10-15 urn in vivo, that is, ellipsoidal on
average, sometimes globular or elongate ellipsoidal; nucleoli inconspicuous. Usually one
globular, minute micronucleus attached to each macronuclear nodule. Contractile vacuole
without collecting canals, near mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules inconspicuous
and easily confused with cytoplasmic inclusions, form widely spaced longitudinal rows, do
not distinctly impregnate with the protargol method used; when methyl green-pyronin is
added, they become red but are not released (Fig. 154b); individual granules inconspicuous
because only 0.5-1.0 urn across and almost colourless, most distinct in Benin cells (Fig.
398k), very indistinct in Venezuelan specimens; close beneath cortex ellipsoidal structures,
likely mitochondria, as in most Urosoma species. Cytoplasm colourless and rather strongly
granulated, contains ordinary crystals 1-6 urn in size, mainly in posterior body portion, some
small lipid droplets, and 7-10 um-sized food vacuoles with bacteria. Movement without
peculiarities, that is, swims and glides rapidly on microscope slide and debris, showing great
flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri rather variable (Fig. 154a, g, h; Table 138). All cirri about
15 urn long in vivo, those of marginal rows and amphisiellid median cirral row usually
composed of two ciliary rows with four cilia each. Marginal rows open posteriorly, right row
extends onto dorsolateral surface anteriorly and terminates about 5 \im ahead of rear body
end, left row ends terminally near body midline. Frontal cirri distinctly enlarged, form
transverse row, right cirrus, as is usual, behind distal end of adoral zone. Buccal cirrus
enlarged (3 x 3-4 basal bodies), right of anterior end of paroral and ahead of endoral. Usually
three slightly enlarged cirri behind right frontal cirrus, form short frontal row terminating on
average at 25% of body length. Rare specimens have two short frontal rows. Amphisiellid
median cirral row composed of an anterior portion and a posterior portion, shifted about 5 urn
leftward, usually terminating at 53% of body length. Transverse and postperistomial cirri
absent.
Dorsal bristles 3-4 urn long in vivo, arranged in four rows (Fig. 154h). Row 1 shortened
anteriorly and less densely ciliated than row 2, which begins, like row 3, near anterior end;

row 4, a dorsomarginal kinety (Fig. 154i), composed of only 4-7 bristles and thus terminating
distinctly ahead of mid-body. Caudal cirri inconspicuous in vivo because hardly longer than
marginal cirri, composed of 2 x 2 basal bodies; usually one cirrus each associated with bristle
rows 1-3, rarely two or three cirri with row 1 and two cirri with row 3.
Adoral zone of membranelles occupies 19-32%, on average 26% of body length, roughly in
Gonostomum pattern, that is, extends straight along left body margin, performing right bend
and slight clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal cavity; number of adoral membranelles
unusually variable (Table 138), bases of largest membranelles about 7 urn wide in vivo.
Buccal cavity flat and narrow. Buccal lip conspicuously projecting and extending from
surface of cell at right angles, bears paroral membrane and covers posterior portion of buccal
cavity and right half of rear end of adoral zone. Undulating membranes almost straight and
both likely composed of a single row of basal bodies; paroral with about 5 urn long cilia,
begins on average 3 urn ahead of endoral and is about 8 urn long; endoral usually alongside
paroral, about 11 urn long, terminates near proximal end of adoral zone of membranelles.
Pharyngeal fibres clearly recognizable in protargol preparations, of ordinary length and
structure (Fig. 154a, g).

c Rarely occur specimens with four macronuclear nodules.
d Rarely occur specimens without buccal cirrus.
Ontogenesis: Five cirral anlagen are recognizable in early and middle dividers, as in
some other amphisiellids (EIGNER & FoiSSNER 1954). In late dividers, all cirri of the
rightmost anläge (V) migrate anteriad and produce the anterior portion of the amphisiellid
median cirral row, while all cirri of anläge IV form the posterior portion (Fig. 154i). How-
ever, the alignment of the two portions is rather incomplete, that is, they are laterally
separated by 3-9 urn in interphase specimens. Dorsal ontogenesis proceeds as usual, that is,
dorsal kineties 1-3 develop within the parental kineties, while kinety 4 originates dorso-
marginally, that is, from an anläge near the right marginal row (Fig. 154i).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at three sites of the southern hemi-
sphere, namely the type location, where it occurred with high abundance; in Benin (Fig.
154d-f; soil sample from near the National University; kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Jean
DRAGESCO); and in a soil sample from Venezuela.
697

Comparison with related species: Nudiamphisiella interrupta differs from all
amphisiellids by the conspicuous discontinuity of the amphisiellid median cirral row (Fig.
154g, arrows), a feature recognizable even in live specimens. Lamtostyla australis
(BLATTERER & FOISSNER, 1988), Amphisiellides illuvialis EIGNER & FOISSNER, 1994, and -»
Gastrostyla spp. have a similar habitus, but more or less distinct transverse cirri. Para-
gastrostyla lanceolata HEMBERGER, 1985 has 15-18 macronuclear nodules and lacks a buccal
cirrus. Orthoamphisiella grelli EIGNER & FOISSNER, 1993 is smaller (60-90 x 20-30 urn vs.
120-170 x 35-55 urn), lacks caudal cirri and cortical granules, and has a continuous
frontoventral row, two buccal cirri (vs. one), usually eight cirri left of the frontoventral cirral
row (vs. three), and two dorsal kineties (vs. four). In vivo, Nudiamphisiella interrupta is thus
identified by the discontinuous median cirral row, the cortical granules, and the lack of
transverse cirri.
Afroamphisiella nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Amphisiellidae with one or several cirri left of amphisiellid median cirral row,
which is involved in oral primordium formation. Transverse cirri, caudal cirri, and post-
peristomial cirri lacking.
Type species: Afroamphisiella multinucleata nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun Africa and the generic name Amphisiella.
Feminine gender.
Classification and comparison with related genera: Afroamphisiella
likely belongs to the Amphisiellidae because the long ventral cirral row (= amphisiellid
median cirral row; ACR) is involved in the formation of the oral primordium (Fig. 155k).
Unfortunately, we could not find middle and late dividers showing the family character,
namely, that the ACR is formed by two segments which align one after the other. By contrast,
in Orthoamphisiella EIGNER & FOISSNER, 1991 - type of the Orthoamphisiellidae EIGNER,
1997 - the long ventral row does not participate in the origin of the oral primordium and
develops from a single primordium within the central portion of the parental row (EIGNER &
FOISSNER 1993).
Afroamphisiella is characterized by some cirri left of the anterior end of the ACR and the lack
of transverse cirri, caudal cirri, and postperistomial cirri (= cirri behind buccal vertex). This
combination of features separates it clearly from all other amphisiellids, as defined by EIGNER
& FOISSNER (1994) and PETZ & FOISSNER (1996), which have transverse and/or caudal cirri.
Accordingly, Afroamphisiella is probably the most derived member of the group.
Lamtostyla abdita FOISSNER, 1997d matches Afroamphisiella multinucleata both in interphase
(lack of postperistomial, transverse, and caudal cirri) and early ontogenesis (participation of
ACR in oral primordium formation). Thus, it is transferred to this genus: Afroamphisiella
abdita (FOISSNER, 1997) nov. comb. FOISSNER (1997d) already emphasized the special
position of this species.
698

Afroamphisiella multinucleata nov. spec. (Fig. 155a-k; 381 j, k; Table 139)
Diagnosis: Size about 85 * 23 urn in vivo; outline elongate rectangular. Cortical granules
in distinct rows, yellowish, about 1.0 * 0.5 urn. On average 18 macronuclear nodules, 17 cirri
in left and 21 in right marginal row, 14 cirri in amphisiellid median cirral row, 1 cirrus behind
right frontal cirrus, 1 buccal cirrus, and 2 dorsal kineties. Adoral zone composed of 17
membranelies on average, bipartited by an inconspicuous gap at left anterior margin of cell
into a distal portion with 3-4 membranelles and a proximal portion with about 14 membra-
nelles.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E
(site 61 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective multinucleata (having many nuclei) refers to the
numerous macronuclear nodules.
Description: Size 70-100 * 18-30 urn in vivo, length:width ratio 3.1-4.5:1, on average
3.7:1 in vivo, while 3:1 in protargol preparations; very flexible but acontractile. Outline
usually elongate rectangular, that is, with parallel margins and broadly rounded ends, rarely
other shapes occur (Fig. 155f-h); dorsoventrally flattened up to 1.5:1, ventral side flat, dorsal
distinctly vaulted in mid-body or posterior half (Fig. 155a, d-h). Macronuclear nodules
mainly left of midline (Table 139), ellipsoidal or dumb-bell-shaped, rarely globular, with few
nucleoli 1-2 urn across. Micronuclei globular, attached or near macronuclear nodules.
Contractile vacuole with two collecting canals slightly above mid-body at left cell margin.
Cortical granules in longitudinal, rather widely spaced rows, do not impregnate with
protargol, but when methyl green-pyronin is added, they become red, released, and swell to a
voluminous, membranous coat; individual granules ellipsoidal, yellowish, highly refractive
and thus conspicuous although only about 1.0 * 0.5 urn (Fig. 155b, c; 38lj, k). Cytoplasm
colourless, packed with granules about 1 urn across and, in posterior third, 2-5 um-sized lipid
droplets. Feeds on bacteria digested in vacuoles about 6 um across. Glides slowly on
microscope slide and soil particles.
Cirral pattern very constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 155a, i, k; Table 139).
Frontoventral and marginal cirri about 8 urn long in vivo, fine because usually composed of
four cilia only. Marginal rows widely open posteriorly, right row begins near level of buccal
cirrus and ends subterminally, left row usually slightly shorter than right posteriorly. Most

700

specimens have five frontoventral cirri, that is, three frontal cirri with left cirrus often slightly
enlarged, one buccal cirrus, and usually one cirrus (rarely two or three cirri) behind right
frontal cirrus. Amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR) begins right of right frontal cirrus and
extends to body midline at 55% of body length on average; straight, that is, does not have, as
in some other species, a slight bow or interruption where the row fragments unite during late
ontogenesis. Transverse and postperistomial cirri absent.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows with distances between
dikinetids becoming wider from anterior to posterior, rarely a short third row between anterior
portion of row 2 and right body margin. Row 1 anteriorly slightly more shortened than row 2;
posteriormost dikinetid in cell's midline and thus not unequivocally assignable to one of the
two rows. Caudal cirri absent (Fig. 155j).
Adoral zone occupies 26-^12%, on average 31% of body length, composed of an average of
17 membranelles, bases of largest membranelies about 5 urn wide in vivo. Distalmo st three or
o
four membranelles separated from proximal segment of zone by more or less distinct gap
(Fig. 155a, f, i, k; Table 139). Buccal cavity flat and narrow, anterior margin, however, rather
distinct, forming bow with dorsal buccal wall (Fig. 155f). Buccal lip distinctly curved, covers
right half of buccal cavity and proximal portion of adoral zone. Exact structure and arrange-
ment of undulating membranes not unequivocally recognizable; paroral and endoral mem-
brane short and almost straight, parallel to each other with posterior, respectively, anterior
portion slightly overlapping; paroral cilia about 8 urn long in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres clearly
recognizable in vivo and after protargol impregnation, of ordinary length and structure,
extend obliquely backwards.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, that is, a highly saline
soil from the margin of the Etosha Pan. BORROR & EVANS (1979) found this or a very similar
species in protargol slides made by Dr. E. SMALL during ecological investigations in the
Chesapeake Bay estuary, Maryland, USA (Fig. 155 1; see also next paragraph).
Comparison with related species: Afroamphisiella abdita (FOISSNER, 1997d) has
four macronuclear nodules, usually two buccal cirri, and two short frontoventral rows left of
the amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR), which has on average about the same relative
length as in A. multinucleata (55%). Orthoamphisiella stramenticola EIGNER & FOISSNER,
1991 and O. grelli EIGNER & FOISSNER, 1993 also lack transverse and caudal cirri; however,
they have four, respectively, two macronuclear nodules (against 14-29 in A. multinucleata).
—> Orthoamphisiella breviseries has a dumb-bell-shaped macronucleus and very short
frontoventral rows not extending beyond buccal vertex. Uroleptoides kihni WENZEL, 1953
sensu BORROR & EVANS (1979) is probably Afroamphisiella multinucleata because the
nuclear and cirral pattern are very similar, even in details such as the beginning of the right
marginal row at the level of the buccal cirrus (Fig. 155 1). The only difference worth
mentioning is the number of dorsal kineties: three in BORROR & EVANS1 population, usually
two in A. multinucleata. However, we also found specimens with a short third row, indicating
that this feature may be somewhat variable in this species. In vivo, Afroamphisiella multi-
nucleata is easily identified by the following combination of features: rows of yellowish,
cortical granules; many macronuclear nodules; single, long ventral cirral row, one buccal
cirrus.

Orthoamphisiella breviseries nov. spec. (Fig. 156a-k; 389a-d; Table 139)
Diagnosis: Size about 100 * 15 um in vivo, that is, conspicuously elongate ellipsoidal.
Macronucleus vermiform to dumb-bell-shaped. 20 adoral membranelies, 2 buccal cirri at
anterior end of undulating membranes, and 8 frontoventral cirri in 2 short rows on average. 2
dorsal kineties.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of EtoshaPan, Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E
(site 61 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective brevis (short) and the Latin noun series
(row), referring to the short rightmost frontoventral row.
703

Description: Size 80-120 x 15-20 urn in vivo, length:width ratio about 5:1 in vivo, 2.5-
4:1, on average 3.3:1 in protargol preparations, where specimens shrink longitudinally by up
to 50%; width, in contrast, not changed significantly (Fig. 156a, f, h; Table 139). Very
flexible but acontractile. Conspicuously elongate, overall shape ellipsoidal to slightly
lanceolate with broadest site at buccal entrance, margins straight to slightly convex, ends
rounded; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1, ventral side flat, dorsal slightly vaulted. Macro-
nucleus in longitudinal axis of cell left of midline, very likely basically consists of two
elongate nodules connected by an usually broad bridge providing the nucleus with a dumb-
bell-shaped or vermiform, wrinkled outline; nucleoli 1-3 urn across. Micronuclei globular,
attached to or near macronucleus (Fig. 156a, e, g, i, j). Contractile vacuole near mid-body at
left cell margin, disappears rapidly under cover glass pressure. No special cortical granules.
Cytoplasm colourless, granulated by lipid droplets 1-2 urn across concentrated at left body
margin; without crystals. Feeds on bacteria digested in slightly ellipsoidal and globular
vacuoles 5-7 urn across. Movement without peculiarities.
Cirral pattern very constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 156a, b, d, h-k; Table
139). All cirri about 10 urn long in vivo. Marginal rows open widely posteriorly right of
midline because right row ends subterminally and left curves to midline at end of cell,
forming a J-shaped "tail" composed of closely spaced cirri. On average 13 cirri on frontal
field, that is, three slightly enlarged frontal cirri, two buccal cirri near anterior end of
undulating membranes, three cirri in frontoventral row 1, which is in line with right frontal
cirrus, and five cirri in frontoventral row 2. Frontoventral rows invariably obliquely extending
and shorter than adoral zone of membranelies. Postperistomial cirri, transverse cirri and
caudal cirri definitely lacking. Ontogenesis commences apokinetally in mid-body (Fig. 156k).
Dorsal bristles 3-4 urn long in vivo and very widely spaced (10 urn), form two slightly
oblique rows (Fig. 156h, i): row 1, which extends in midline, distinctly shortened anteriorly
and posteriorly; row 2, which is bipolar, commences near cell's midline and extends on right
dorsolateral surface to posterior end.
Adoral zone usually in Gonostomum pattern, that is, commences slightly right of midline and
extends straight along left body margin, performing rather abrupt right bend to plunge into
buccal cavity (Fig. 156g, h, k); conspicuously short, that is, occupies only about 25% of body
length in vivo and 28% on average in shrunken protargol preparations; composed of an
average of 20 membranelles, largest membranelles 4—5 urn wide in vivo. Buccal cavity very
flat and narrow in vivo, often broadened in protargol preparations. Buccal lip conspicuously
convex, covers buccal cavity and right half of rear end of adoral zone, bears paroral mem-
brane at upper left margin. Exact arrangement and structure of undulating membranes
unknown
because of preparation artifacts mentioned; paroral and endoral membrane of about same
length, paroral ahead of endoral and in vivo composed of closely spaced, 7 urn long cilia (Fig.
156b). Pharyngeal fibres recognizable in vivo and after protargol impregnation, extend
obliquely backwards.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and in a highly saline soil
sample from Saudi Arabia. Thus, Orthoamphisiella breviseries very likely prefers saline
inland soils. The congeners were also discovered in terrestrial habitats: Orthoamphisiella
stramenticola in leaf litter from Austria and Japan, and O. grelli in moss and soil from a river
bank on Gough Island. This indicates that Orthoamphisiella, although cosmopolitan, is con-
704

DK2-
705

fined to terrestrial biotopes, or at least prefers such habitats.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: The
Namibian population matches Orthoamphisiella EIGNER & FOISSNER, 1991, except for the
long ventral row, which is lacking. However, we cannot exclude that the rightmost fronto-
ventral row of O. breviseries is a shortened, long ventral row. If ontogenetic data prove that
this is not the case, then the Namibian species should be separated at subgeneric or generic
level. This would also apply if ontogenesis shows that it belongs to the Amphisiellidae
because all amphisiellid genera have transverse and/or caudal cirri (PETZ & FOISSNER 1996),
except of —» Afroamphisiella which, however, has a long ventral cirral row.
Orthoamphisiella breviseries differs from the congeners mainly by the lack of the long
ventral cirral row. Furthermore, the macronucleus of O. stramenticola EIGNER & FOISSNER,
1991 and O. grelli EIGNER & FOISSNER, 1993 is separated into four, respectively, two distinct
nodules, whereas it is a single, more or less dumb-bell-shaped mass in O. breviseries; this
unique pattern separates it also from —> Afroamphisiella spp. Orthoamphisiella franzi
(FOISSNER, 1982) EIGNER, 1995 has 7-17 macronuclear nodules, two long ventral rows, a
long (about 50% of body length) adoral zone, and three dorsal kineties. In vivo, Ortho-
amphisiella breviseries is easily identified by the following combination of features: rod-
shaped macronuclear mass; few frontoventral cirri arranged in three to four short, oblique
rows not extending beyond adoral zone of membranelles; short adoral zone of membranelles;
very flat and narrow buccal cavity.
Lamtostyla halophila nov. spec. (Fig. 157a-v; 390a-e; Table 140)
Diagnosis: Size about 70 x 25 urn in vivo; slenderly ellipsoidal. On average 2 macro-
nuclear nodules, 19 cirri in left and 24 in right marginal row, 4 cirri in amphisiellid median
cirral row (ACR), 1-2 cirri left of ACR, 1 buccal cirrus, 3—4 transverse cirri, and 2-3 dorsal
kineties. Adoral zone continuous, consists of 17-18 membranelles on average. Buccal cavity
narrow and flat. The oral primordium develops postorally and independently of the ACR.
Type location: Highly saline soil from the margin of a pond in the surroundings of the
town of Maltahöhe, Namibia, 24°55'S 16°55'E (site 18 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words halös (salt) and philos (preferring), referring
to the saline habitats the species occurs.

706

Description: Two populations were studied, of which that from site (69) was much more
variable than the type (Table 140). The diagnosis and description comprise both populations
because conspecificity is beyond reasonable doubt.
Size 55-100 x 20-30 urn in vivo, usually about 70 x 25 urn. Ellipsoidal to slenderly
ellipsoidal, length:width ratio 2.2—4:1 in vivo, 1.7-3.3:1, on average about 2.5:1 in protargol
preparations, where specimens tend to become inflated; dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1
(Fig. 157a, e, f; Table 140). Macronuclear nodules in middle third of cell left of midline,
ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal (up to 4:1), usually with rather irregular outline both in vivo
and protargol preparations; nucleoli large and irregularly branched. Micronuclei globular,
usually one attached to each macronuclear nodule, difficult to recognize in vivo and protargol
preparations because hyaline and faintly impregnated. Contractile vacuole in mid-body at left
margin. Cytopyge in posterior end left of midline, faecal clumps contain highly refractive
bacterial spores embedded in fluffy material (Fig. 157e). Cortical granules loosely arranged,
in vivo difficult to recognize because colourless and only 0.5-1 |am across, usually impreg-
nate with protargol (Fig. 157e; 390a-c, e). Cytoplasm colourless, without crystals and lipid
droplets. Feeds on long, spore-forming bacteria collected in ellipsoidal vacuoles up to 10 urn
across (Fig. 157a). Glides slowly on microscope slide and organic debris.
Cirri about 12 urn long in vivo, very fine because composed of only two to four cilia, except
for frontal cirri usually comprising six cilia each, first frontal cirrus often enlarged and
composed of eight cilia. Marginal rows open widely posteriorly. Frontal cirral row
(amphisiellid median cirral row, ACR) at right margin of rather distinct crest, shorter than
adoral zone of membranelles because composed of only four cirri on average; likewise,
transverse cirri insert at right margin of flat crest. Buccal cirrus invariably right of anterior
end of paroral. Dorsal bristles 3-4 um long, very loosely arranged, especially in left row,
which is lacking in about 60% of specimens from site (69); no caudal cirri (Fig. 157a-c; 390a,
d).
Oral apparatus inconspicuous because adoral zone narrow and occupying only 27% of body
length; composed of an average of 18 membranelles, bases of largest membranelles 4 urn
wide in vivo, only about 2 urn in anterior third of zone. Buccal cavity narrow and flat. Buccal
lip rather conspicuous, arched, covers posterior third of adoral zone of membranelles. Paroral
and endoral membrane very small, staggered in parallel, both near adoral zone of membra-
nelles and very likely composed of a single row of cilia (basal bodies), often slightly
obliquely arranged. Paroral cilia form distinct, triangular velum with cilia 12 urn long at
anterior end and only 5 urn at posterior (Fig. 157a, b, d; 390a, d). Pharyngeal fibres distinct
only inprotargol preparations.
Ontogenesis: Division of Lamtostyla halophila is very similar to that of L. australis
(FOISSNER, 1988a) PETZ & FOISSNER, 1996, as described by Voss (1992); Lamtostyla
edaphoni BERGER & FOISSNER, 1987, as described by PETZ & FOISSNER (1996); and
Lamtostyla perisincirra (HEMBERGER, 1985) BERGER & FOISSNER, 1987, as described by
BERGER et al. (1984). Thus, it will be not described in detail, but the reader is referred to the
detailed figures and figure explanations (Fig. 157j-v). Three main differences should be
noted: (i) the oral primordium does not develop near the transverse cirri but in mid-body (Fig.
157j, k); (ii) no patch of basal bodies develops at the posterior end of the ACR, which
originates, as is typical for the family (EIGNER & FOISSNER 1994), by posterior-anterior
alignment of the two rightmost anlagen 4 and 5 (Fig. 157s-u); (iii) the parental adoral zone of

Fig. 157j-p. Lamtostyla halophila, ontogenesis of ventral (j~°) ar>d dorsal (p) infraciliature after protargol impregnation. The
oral primordium (OP) originates apokinetally in mid-body and produces five cirral streaks (numbers 1-5), which unite with
streaks generated by parental frontoventral cirri (one each by the buccal cirrus, the cirrus left of the amphisiellid median
cirral row, and the last cirrus of the amphisiellid median cirral row) to form long primary primordia (n). Streak 5, however, is
generated entirely by the oral primordium (k-n). The primary primordia split in the middle to produce five cirral anlagen
each in proter and opisthe (o). The dorsal kineties reproduce by intrakinetal proliferation of dikinetids (p; parental kinetids
ciliated). Note that dividers become distinctly smaller and broader during the process. Drawn to scale 30 urn.

figures 157g-i). Dorsal kineties reproduce by intrakinetal proliferation of kinetids (parental kinetids ciliated in [r], newly
formed ciliated in [v]) and do not produce caudal cirri. Scale bars 30 (im.

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in three highly saline soil samples from
Namibia (sites 11, 18, 69), indicating that it is a halophilous species. The populations studied
reproduced readily in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: The
populations belong, according to the recent revision by PETZ & FOISSNER (1996), to
Lamtostyla because the oral primordium originates apokinetally and the amphisiellid median
cirral row (ACR) commences anlagen formation at the posterior end. Morphologically,
Lamtostyla halophila resembles, due to the cortical granules, L. granulifera FOISSNER, 1997d,
which, however, is much larger (about 150 x 35 urn), has three cirri left of the frontal row,
and possesses conspicuous, curved undulating membranes. Lamtostyla edaphoni, L. kirkensis,
and L. hyalina (see BERGER & FOISSNER 1988a for authorships and dates) are highly similar
to L. halophila in having only a single cirrus left of the ACR. However, they lack cortical
granules, have a bipartited adoral zone of membranelles (L. hyalina) or many more cirri (6-13
vs. 3-5) in the ACR (L. edaphoni, L. kirkensis). Thus, Lamtostyla halophila is a distinct
species easily separated from its congeners.
Lamtostyla decorata nov. spec. (Fig. 158a-m; 381 1; Table 141)
Diagnosis: Size about 140 x 25 urn in vivo. Oblong and usually twisted about main body
axis. Cortical granules colourless, about 0.3 urn across, form conspicuous plaques around
dorsal bristles. On average 2 macronuclear nodules, 32 cirri in left and 36 in right marginal
row, 4 cirri in amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR), 3 cirri left of ACR, 1 buccal cirrus at
summit of strongly curved undulating membranes, 7 transverse cirri, and 3 dorsal kineties.
Adoral zone continuous, on average consists of 20 membranelles, with largest bases about 6
urn wide. Buccal cavity of ordinary width, deep.
Type location: Litter from Welwitschia mirabilis near the Welwitschia Drive in the
central Namib Desert, Namibia, 22°45'S 15°25'E (site 31 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective decorata (ornamented) refers to the granule plaques.
Description: Three populations were studied, namely from Namibian sites (1) and (31)
and from Australia. They agree in most, but not all features (see below). Thus, data are kept
separate and the diagnosis and description contain only the type population.
Size 100-170 x 20-35 urn in vivo, length:width ratio about 5-6:1 (range 4-9:1) in vivo, on
average 4.8:1 in protargol preparations, where cells are slightly inflated (Table 141). Body
slender, often slightly sigmoidal, usually curved and/or even spiralized by half a turn about
main body axis, distinctly flattened only in oral region (Fig. 158d, j, m); very flexible but
acontractile, fragile and thus rather distorted in the preparations. Macronuclear nodules
slightly left of midline, ellipsoidal, sometimes globular, with many medium-sized and small
nucleoli; rarely specimens with four nodules occur. Micronuclei globular, attached to
macronuclear nodules at variable positions. Contractile vacuole without distinct collecting
canals above mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules scattered around bases of cirri
712

and in conspicuous plaques around dorsal bristles; individual granules inconspicuous because
only about 0.3 urn across and colourless, neither impregnate with protargol nor stain or
extrude when methyl green-pyronin is added (Fig. 158e, f; 381 1). Cytoplasm colourless with
many fat globules 1-10 urn across, specimens thus dark at low magnification. Feeds on
bacteria and small ciliates (Pseudocohnilembus sp.). Movement conspicuous because slow
and serpentine.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 158a-d, m; Table 141). Marginal
cirri only about 8 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows slightly shortened posteriorly, right
row extends onto dorsolateral surface anteriorly. Frontal cirri slightly to distinctly enlarged,
right one, as is usual, at distal end of adoral zone. Buccal cirrus close to summit of paroral
membrane. Usually three cirri left of amphisiellid median cirral row, first cirrus often slightly
dislocated to left and thus behind right frontal cirrus. Amphisiellid median cirral row usually
composed of only four cirri, commences right of right frontal cirrus and terminates at 21% of
body length on average; thus it is only slightly longer than the adoral zone, which occupies
19%; distance between second and third cirrus usually slightly enlarged. Transverse cirri
about 15 urn long in vivo, near posterior body margin and thus distinctly projecting, form U-
like pattern with one (pretransverse) cirrus in U-cavity (Fig. 158b, m). Dorsal bristles about 3
um long in vivo, arranged in three rows; row 1 distinctly shortened anteriorly. No caudal
cirri.
Gross and fine morphology of oral apparatus as in —> Amphisiella binucleata multicirrata
(Fig. 158a, b, d, t). Adoral zone occupies only 14-23%, on average 19% of body length,
composed of about 20 membranelies, bases of largest membranelles about 6 urn wide in vivo.
Buccal cavity deep and moderately wide, anterior cavity margin Cyrtohymena-Mke curved;
right margin forms prominent lip, covers cavity and proximal adoral membranelles. Undulat-
ing membranes distinctly curved, both likely composed of closely spaced dikinetids and
optically intersecting near mid. Pharyngeal fibres, likely mixed with long endoral cilia,
prominent in vivo and after protargol impregnation, of ordinary length and structure, extend
obliquely backwards.
Ontogenesis commences with the formation of a very narrow oral primordium extending from
near the transverse cirri to the buccal vertex. Concomitantly, the posterior cirri of the
amphisiellid median cirral row modify to anlagen.
Observations on Namibian site (1) specimens (Fig. 158n-w; Table 141):
The Namibian site (1) specimens are distinctly larger than those from type locality (length
140-220 urn vs. 100-170 urn in vivo) and thus many morphometric features are considerably

sometimes almost cylindroidal; (ii) the cortical granules around the bases of the cirri and
dorsal bristles are a mixture of small (about 0.5 urn) and large (up to 2 urn) globules, as in the
Australian specimens; and (iii) the distal 1-3 urn of all cilia/cirri and dorsal bristles are
heavily argyrophilic, a curious property we never observed in any other hypotrich.
Observations on an Australian population (Table 141): A morphometric
analysis of the Australian specimens, which have a size of about 110 x 20 urn in vivo, reveals
two rather distinct differences to the type population, namely, (i) 6-8, on average 7 vs. 4-5,
on average 4 cirri in the amphisiellid median cirral row; and (ii) 5-6, on average 5 vs. 6-9, on
average 7 transverse cirri. Furthermore, the cortical granules are larger (1.0-1.5 urn vs. 0.3
urn across) and the plaques (granules groups) not confined to the ciliature, but occur
throughout the cortex.

Occurrence and ecology: In Namibia as yet found at type location, that is,
Welwitschia litter, and at site (1), where, however, a rather deviating population occurred (see
above). Furthermore, it occurred at site (49), indicating a wide ecological range. The
Australian population inhabited a highly saline soil from the shore of Lake Amadeus near the
town of Alice Springs. Abundances were low in all samples, where L. decorata, interestingly,
fed mainly on Pseudocohnilembus sp.; the Namibian site (1) specimens, however, ingested
the flagellate Polytomella and medium-sized ciliates, such as Colpoda maupasi and Uro-
somoida agiliformis. In Austria, we found L. decorata in soil from Salzburg, but did not study
it in detail. Thus, L. decorata is likely a euryoecious, euryhaline cosmopolitan.
Generic classification, comparison with related species, and
ranking of populations: This species is classified in Lamtostyla BUITKAMP, 1977
because stomatogenesis commences apokinetally near the transverse cirri, as in L. australis
(VOSS 1992). By contrast, in Amphisiella GOURRET & ROESER, 1888, which has the same
interphase characteristics as Lamtostyla, the oral primordium originates in close contact with
the amphisiellid median cirral row (PETZ & FOISSNER 1996, WlCKLOW 1982). Interestingly,
the transverse cirri are arranged U-like in most Lamtostyla species; even the decorata pattern
with a single cirrus in the U-cavity is not unique, but also found in L. hyalina (for a review,
see BERGER & FOISSNER 1988a). Furthermore, all large (> 100 urn) Lamtostyla species have a
718

deep buccal cavity and the undulating membranes side by side and distinctly curved. The
small species, for instance —»• L. halophila, have a flat buccal cavity and short, almost straight
undulating membranes, similar to Gonostomum (BERGER 1999). Accordingly, L. decorata and
other large Lamtostyla species are probably misclassified. They might belong to a new genus
or to Amphisiella. Further studies are necessary, especially on the oral apparatus with its
unique buccal lip.
Lamtostyla decorata is obviously closely related to L. granulifera FOISSNER, 1997d; L. longa
(HEMBERGER, 1985) BERGER & FOISSNER, 1988a; and L. raptans (HEMBERGER, 1985)
FOISSNER, 1997d: all have seven cirri each in the frontal field and near the posterior end
(transverse and pretransverse cirri). Lamtostyla decorata differs (i) from L. granulifera by
body shape (elongate and often twisted about main axis vs. slenderly to rather broadly
elliptical), cortical granules (0.3 urn across and packed around dorsal bristles vs. 1-2 urn
across forming many closely spaced rows), number of right and left marginal cirri (36 and 32
vs. 44 and 45), and the width of the adoral membranelles (6 um vs. 12 um); (ii) from L. longa
by body shape (elongate and often twisted about main axis vs. slenderly to rather broadly
elliptical), number of right and left marginal cirri (36 and 32 vs. 23 and 21), number of dorsal
kineties (3 vs. 5), and, most importantly, by the location of the buccal cirrus (about 8 urn
behind anterior end of undulating membranes vs. at anterior end of undulating membranes);
(iii) from L. raptans by size (100-170 x 20-40 urn vs. 200 x 40 urn), body shape (see L.
longa above), number of right and left marginal cirri (32-41 and 27-36 vs. 57-68 and 60-62),
number of adoral membranelles (19-22 vs. 33-36), and number of dorsal kineties (3 vs. 5).
Possibly, Lamtostyla longa and L. raptans differ from L. decorata also by the lack of cortical
granules. However, such granules might have been overlooked by HEMBERGER (1985), who
did not study live specimens in detail.
Lamtostyla australis, which occurs in the same slides, is easily distinguished from L. decorata
by body shape (elongate ellipsoidal, not twisted), the much longer amphisiellid median cirral
row (8-15 cirri), the lower number of transverse cirri (usually 2), and the location of the
buccal cirrus (near anterior end of paroral). In vivo, Lamtostyla decorata is characterized by
the following combination of features: slender, usually twisted body; cortical granule plaques
around dorsal bristles; short amphisiellid median cirral row hardly extending above buccal
vertex.
The three populations, all studied independently because originally classified as distinct
species, differ considerably in morphometrics and some morphological details, suggesting
subspecies ranking. On the other hand, a biogeographic pattern is hardly recognizable (see
cortical granules) and the cirral pattern is very similar in all specimens. Furthermore, one of
the most important features, viz., the number of adoral membranelles, is rather similar, and
the taxonomic value of some other characteristics (e.g., micronuclear shape) uncertain. Thus,
we prefer to classify all populations in a single species at the present state of knowledge. The
ambiguity of this decision becomes obvious when the species' diagnosis is amended to
include all populations: "Size 110-220 x 20-30 urn in vivo. Oblong and usually twisted about
main body axis. Cortical granules colourless, about 0.3-2 urn across, form conspicuous
plaques around dorsal bristles. On average 2 macronuclear nodules and 2 globular to elongate
ellipsoidal micronuclei; 32-58 cirri in left and 34-60 in right marginal row; 4—7 cirri in
amphisiellid median cirral row (ACR) and 3 cirri left of ACR; 1 buccal cirrus at summit of
strongly curved undulating membranes; 5-7 transverse cirri and 3 dorsal kineties. Adoral
719

zone continuous, consists of 20-25 membranelies on average with largest bases about 6 urn
wide. Buccal cavity of ordinary width, deep".

1 right and 1 left row of marginal cirri. 5 or 6 dorsal kineties. Caudal cirri present. Proter and

Remarks: The diagnosis is adapted to fit the monograph of BERGER (1999). The onto-
genetic data available and those presented below suggest that Gastrostyla should be split into
three genera or subgenera. We prefer the latter because the interphase cirral pattern is rather
similar in all species and the genus is still small, that is, contains only seven species (BERGER
1999).
Gastrostyla {Gastrostyla) ENGELMANN, 1862 nov. stat.
Diagnosis: Proter and opisthe cirral anlagen develop independently, and anläge II of the
opisthe does not extend above proter's oral vertex. The middle portion of the amphisiellid
median (frontoventral) cirral row consists of a single cirrus.
Type species: Gastrostyla steinii ENGELMANN, 1862.
Remarks: The following species, whose ontogenesis is unknown, remain in this subgenus:
Gastrostyla dorsicirrata FOISSNER, 1982; Gastrostyla muscorum KAHL, 1932; Gastrostyla
setifera (ENGELMANN, 1862) KENT, 1882; Gastrostyla pulchra (PEREYASLAWZEWA, 1886)
KAHL, 1932.
29 Cirral numbering and designation is partially borrowed from the oxytrichids, as explained in BERGER (1999)
and figures 160q, r, although homology is uncertain [see discussion under Gastrostyla (Spetastyla) mystacea].

dividers showing variability of prater's cirral anlagen. Likely, no frontoterminal cirri are involved in anlagen formation.
Possibly, anlagen IV-VI of the proter originate from cirrus IV/3 (arrows in a and b), as in Sterkieila nova; however, it cannot
be excluded that the anteriormost cirrus of the posterior portion of the frontoventral row is involved (asterisks in a and b).

Detailed data on the ontogenesis of Gastrostyla steinii were published by WALKER & GRIM
(1973) and especially HEMBERGER (1982). We reinvestigated the morphology and morpho-
genesis of a South African population of G. steinii and document the features mentioned in
the diagnosis by a few drawings and many micrographs (Fig. 159a—1; 287-293, 391a-y,
392a-n, p-r, 393a-g, 1-y, 394a-j). Our data largely agree with those of the authors mentioned
above. See figure explanations for details.
In the majority of our Gastrostyla steinii specimens cirrus IV/3 is 2-3 (am shifted leftwards so
722

that the amphisiellid median (frontoventral) cirral row seemingly consists of only an anterior
and posterior portion (Fig. 159a). However, in about 30% of the specimens cirrus FV/3 is
arranged exactly in line with the frontoventral row (Fig. 159b). Thus, it is reasonable to
homologize this cirrus with the middle portion of the frontoventral row of the other sub-
genera.
The resting cysts of the cultivated (Eau de Volvic with some crushed wheat grains) popula-
tion from the Republic of South Africa are colourless and globular with an outer (ectocyst)
diameter of x = 47.4 urn (M = 46 urn, SD = 4.8 urn, SE = 1.1 urn, CV = 10.0%, Min = 40
um, Max = 56 (im, n = 19) and an inner (mesocyst) diameter of x = 40 um (M = 38 um, SD
= 3.7 urn, SE = 0.9 urn, CV = 9.3%, Min = 34 um, Max = 46 um, n = 19); rarely do ellipsoi-
dal cysts occur. The meso- and endocyst are compact, smooth, and 1.5-2 urn thick. The
ectocyst is less compact, has a wrinkled or indistinctly facetted surface, and is 3.6 urn thick
on average. The macronuclear nodules are fused to a reniform mass. The plasm contains
many pale fat globules 3-6 urn across and 1.5 x 1 um-sized, refractive granules (Fig. 159m;
392o, 393i-k).
Gastrostyla (Kleinstyla) nov. subgen.
Diagnosis: Proter and opisthe cirral anlagen develop at least partially from primary
primordia and anläge II of the opisthe extends beyond proter's oral vertex. The middle portion
of the amphisiellid median (frontoventral) cirral row consists of more than one cirrus.
Type species: Gastrostyla {Kleinstyla) bavariensisnov. spec.
Dedication: We dedicate this new subgenus to Dr. h.c. Bruno M. KLEIN (1891-1968), an
Austrian natural scientist, who discovered silver impregnation of protists and was the senior
author's mentor.
Remarks: We consider the different number (one versus several) of cirri comprising the
middle portion of the frontoventral cirral row as a subgeneric feature. Possibly, Gastrostyla
dorsicirrata and G. pulchra also belong to Gastrostyla (Kleinstyla), according to the
incomplete ontogenetic data available (WALLENGREN 1900, BERGER 1999, Hu & SONG
2000).
Gastrostyla (Spetastyla) nov. subgen.
Diagnosis: Proter and opisthe cirral anlagen develop at least partially from primary
primordia and anläge II of the opisthe extends beyond proter's oral vertex. The middle portion
of the amphisiellid median (frontoventral) cirral row consists of a single cirrus.
Type species: Oxytricha mystacea STEIN, 1859.
723

Dedication: We dedicate the new subgenus to Univ.-Doz. Hofrat Dr. Franz SPETA,
director of the Biology Centre of the Upper Austrian Museum of Natural History in Linz, who
made publishing this costly monograph possible.
Remarks: The anlagen V and VI are long streaks (primary primordia) dividing trans-
versely in early-middle dividers, as in the oxytrichids Stylonychia mytilus and Steinia
sphagnicola, providing proter and opisthe with two anlagen each.
Gastrostyla {Spetastyla) mystacea (STEIN, 1859) STERKI, 1878
Improved diagnosis: Size about 130 x 35—45 um in vivo; outline elliptical to elongate
elliptical. 2 macronuclear nodules. Cortical granules ellipsoidal, colourless, form closely
spaced rows. On average 30-37 adoral membranelles, 27-32 left and 27-34 right marginal
cirri, 5 transverse cirri, 13-19 cirri in frontoventral row, and 6 dorsal kineties having one
caudal cirrus each associated with kineties 1 and 2 and one to three cirri with kinety 4.
Frontoventral (amphisiellid median) cirral row terminates near transverse cirri, overlaps with
pretransverse cirral row in subspecies mystacea.
Remarks: The cirral pattern of Gastrostyla minima HEMBERGER, 1985 matches that of G.
mystacea (cp. figures 160e with 161a, b). Thus, FOISSNER et al. (1991) suggested synonymy.
Furthermore, the fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anläge IV produces only one cirrus, which
forms the middle portion of the amphisiellid median (frontoventral) cirral row (cp. figures
160m, o with 161f, g). However, exhaustive morphometric analyses revealed quite a lot of
non-overlapping or only slightly overlapping features, most having low or ordinary variability
coefficients (Table 142). Thus, we consider these allopatric taxa as subspecies of G.
mystacea.

stat. (Fig. 160a-p; 395a-t; Tables 142, 143)
Neotype material: Neotypified from Austrian population (see occurrence and ecology),
according to reasons 1, 3, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 130 x 45 urn in vivo. On average 37 adoral membra-
nelles and 19 cirri in frontoventral (amphisiellid median cirral) row, which distinctly overlaps
pretransverse cirral row.
Redescription: Size 100-160 x 40-50 urn in vivo, length:width ratio about 2.5-3.0:1 in
vivo, 2.1-2.8:1 in protargol preparations, where specimens are slightly inflated; very flexible
but acontractile and flattened up to 2:1 dorsoventrally. Shape fairly constant, outline elliptical
to elongate elliptical, posterior end often bluntly pointed, rarely broadly rounded (Fig. 160a,

b; 395c; Table 142). Macronuclear nodules left of midline, about 23 x 11 urn in vivo,
ellipsoidal to elongate ellipsoidal, with many small and medium-sized nucleoli. Micronuclei
about 5x3 urn in vivo, usually attached to macronuclear nodules. Contractile vacuole near
mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules conspicuous at a magnification of xlOOO
because in closely spaced, meridional rows; individual granules elliptical in lateral and ring-
shaped in top view, about 1.5 x 0.8 urn, colourless, become blue but are not released when
methyl green-pyronin is added; do not impregnate with the protargol method used (Fig. 160b,
c; 395e-g). Cytoplasm colourless, contains lipid droplets 0.5-2 urn across and, especially in
posterior half, many conspicuous crystal-like inclusions, which are 3-5 urn long, dumb-bell-
shaped, colourless, and dissolve slowly when set free (Fig. 160a, d; 395d). Feeds on algae
(mainly Chlamydomonas) digested in vacuoles 8-20 urn across, in pure cultures ingests small
ciliates (Urotricha sp.) and starch grains. Movement without peculiarities, that is, swims and
glides rapidly on microscope slide and debris, showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 160e; 395h-k; Table 142).
Marginal and frontoventral cirri about 20 urn long, usually composed of two rows with 4-5
cilia each (4-5 x 2 pattern), posterior marginal cirri often distinctly smaller, sometimes
composed of only a single row with 4-5 cilia. Right marginal row begins near level of distal
adoral membraneile and terminates 5 urn before body end on average, left row usually J-
shaped because terminating in midline. Frontal cirri distinctly enlarged and arranged as is
usual. Buccal cirrus slightly enlarged (about 5 x3 basal bodies), right of anterior end of
paroral and ahead of endoral. Cirrus behind right frontal cirrus (= cirrus HI/2) slightly
enlarged because composed of about 4 x4 basal bodies. Postoral cirrus (= postperistomial
cirrus according to EIGNER & FOISSNER 1994) usually at margin of oral vertex and optically
thus above proximal adoral membraneile, composed of 4-5 x 3 basal bodies on average.
Frontoventral (amphisiellid median) cirral row conspicuous because extending from right
frontal cirrus to near left transverse cirrus, slightly sigmoidal and interrupted by cirrus IV/3
right of proximal region of adoral zone; composed of three portions (see ontogenesis),
namely, (i) an anterior portion commencing at 12% and terminating at 31% of body length on
average; (ii) a middle portion composed of a single, usually enlarged (4-5 x 3 basal bodies)
cirrus (IV/3) at 34% of body length; and (iii) a posterior portion commencing somewhat right
and slightly behind level of postoral cirrus and terminating near left transverse cirrus.
Frequently some scattered cirri left and/or right of posterior portion of frontoventral row.
Ahead of right transverse cirrus a short row of pretransverse cirri invariably overlapping with
posterior portion of frontoventral row. Transverse cirri in hook-shaped pattern, slightly
enlarged and about 22 urn long in vivo, rather far subterminal and thus only the right cirri
project beyond rear body end.
Dorsal bristles about 4 urn long in vivo, arranged in six rows (Fig. 160e, f): rows 1-3 as well
as 5 and 6 slightly to moderately shortened anteriorly, row 5 terminates equatorially at right
body margin, row 6 composed of only one to four bristles at right anterior comer; row 4 and
its caudal cirri extend dorsoventrally in about 50% of impregnated specimens (Fig. 160e).
Caudal cirri inconspicuous because not distinctly longer than marginal cirri and usually
composed of only 2 * 2 basal bodies; one cirrus each associated with kineties 1 and 2 and
usually two or three cirri with kinety 4. Caudal cirri of kineties 1 and 2 often difficult to
distinguish from last cirri of left marginal row.

Adoral zone occupies 36-45%, on average 42% of body length, of usual shape and structure;
composed of an average of 37 membranelles, bases of largest membranelies about 10 urn
wide in vivo (Fig. 160a, e; 395c, h-k; Table 142). Buccal cavity moderately wide and deep,
right half covered by curved, hyaline lip bearing paroral membrane and covering proximal
portion of adoral zone. Paroral slightly to distinctly curved, composed of zigzagging basal
bodies having about 10 urn long cilia, begins about 5 urn ahead of endoral and terminates
distinctly above proximal end of adoral zone. Endoral slightly curved, extends to proximal
end of adoral zone, alongside posteriorly diverging paroral; in about half the specimens the
anterior ends of the paroral and endoral optically overlap. Pharyngeal fibres clearly recogniz-
able after protargol impregnation, of ordinary length and structure, extend obliquely back-
wards.
Occurrence and ecology: Gastrostyla mystacea mystacea was discovered by STEIN
(1859) in a puddle containing percolating manure of a dunghill in the village of Tharandt near
Dresden, Germany. Later, he found it in similar habitats near Berlin and Prague. We re-
discovered this species in an ephemeric, eutrophic meadow pond near the Salzburg University
(47°47'N 13°40'E) and could cultivate it in Eau de Volvic enriched with some squashed wheat
grains and part of the natural microbial community. The data available indicate that G.
mystacea mystacea prefers nutrient-rich habitats (FoiSSNER et al. 1991). Gastrostyla
opisthoclada, likely a junior synonym of G. mystacea mystacea, was discovered in China (SHI
et al. 1999). For further records from Eurasia and Australia, all lacking illustrations, see
BERGER(1999).
Comparison with original description and related species: Our
specimens agree with the original description of Gastrostyla mystacea in most main features
(cp. Fig. 160a, e with Fig. 395a, b), namely, body length (100-160 urn respectively 130-170
urn), length of adoral zone (about 42% of body length), number (20-30) of cirri in and near
frontoventral row, the limnetic habitat, and geographic region (Austria respectively Germany
and Czech Republic). Three differences are noteworthy: (i) STEIN figures two specimens both
distinctly widened posteriorly (Fig. 395a, b). Our specimens are usually not widened, but
bluntly pointed even when well-fed, that is, in cultures with many dividers. Possibly, STEIN'S
specimens were inflated due to the highly saprobic and likely oxygen-deficient milieu (liquid
manure), (ii) STEIN (1859) did not mention cortical granules, although he described them in
other hypotrichs, for example, Paraurostyla weissei and Urostyla grandis (for review, see
FOISSNER et al. 1991). However, in these species the granules are coloured and make cells
yellowish even at low magnification. By contrast, the granules of our specimens are colour-
less and thus recognizable only at high magnification, suggesting that STEIN (1859), who did
not figure any details, overlooked them, (iii) According to STEIN'S description, the transverse
cirri do not project beyond rear body end, whereas they protrude slightly in our population
(Fig. 160a). However, STEIN'S illustrations show that he very likely underestimated the length
of the transverse cirri, which are only 13-16 urn in his figures, while they are 22 urn long in
our specimens.
Gastrostyla (Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea is the sole species of the genus which has
distinctly more than 20 cirri in and near the frontoventral row (BERGER 1999). Gastrostyla
(Gastrostyla) dorsicirrata lacks cortical granules, has 7-12 caudal cirri in three distinct rows,
and 4-7 cirri originate from anläge IV, while only three do so in both subspecies of Gastro-
styla (Spetastyla) mystacea. Gastrostyla (Gastrostyla) setifera possibly also lacks cortical
granules, is about 270 urn long, and the transverse cirri form two distinct groups. Gastrostyla
730

(Gastrostyla) pulchra is a marine species with the transverse cirri near mid-body (Hu & SONG
2000). In vivo, Gastrostyla mystacea mystacea is almost indistinguishable from the sub-
species minima, which differs only in morphometric features (Table 142). Generally, both can
be distinguished from other hypotrichs by the following combination of features: two
macronuclear nodules; ellipsoidal, colourless cortical granules in inconspicuous rows;
frontoventral row extending from frontal to transverse cirri.
Ontogenesis (Fig. 160g-p; 395 1-p): Ontogenesis commences with the formation of an
oral primordium extending from near the anteriormost transverse cirrus to the buccal vertex.
Some basal bodies of the right anterior portion of the oral primordium migrate towards the
posterior end of the paroral (Fig. 160g, arrow), forming fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anläge
II of the opisthe. No cirri participate in the formation of the oral primordium (Fig. 160g).
Somewhat later, the oral primordium becomes slightly wider anteriorly and anläge II extends
to the rear end of the paroral (Fig. 160h); however, the streak very likely does not participate
in the formation of proter's anläge II, which develops from the buccal cirrus (Fig. 160j).
Simultaneously, the two or three anteriormost cirri of the posterior portion of the fronto-
ventral row are transformed to anlagen V and VI for both the proter and opisthe (Fig. 160h,
asterisks).
Next, the oral primordium begins with the formation of adoral membranelles in the usual
manner (Fig. 160i). A slightly oblique, oblong field of basal bodies originates right of the
anterior end of the oral primordium - likely by participation of the oral primordium and by
incorporation of about three further cirri of the posterior portion of the frontoventral row -
eventually forming the primordium for the opisthe's undulating membranes. Opisthe's anläge
III inserts between opisthe's anläge II mentioned above and the postoral cirrus (Fig. 160i,
arrow). Cirrus IV/3 (= middle portion of frontoventral row) transforms to anläge IV of the
proter (Fig. 160i, arrowhead; 395 1). Anlagen V and VI become longer, that is, develop to
primary primordia (Fig. 160i, asterisks).
Somewhat later, the postoral cirrus is transformed to anläge IV of the opisthe (Fig. 160j,
arrow), cirrus III/2 to anläge III of the proter, and the buccal cirrus generates proter anläge II
(Fig. 160j; 395 1). Anlagen V and VI are now conspicuously long primary primordia and
commence to divide in an anterior portion for the porter and a posterior for the opisthe; on
average, the two posteriormost parental cirri of the anterior portion of the frontoventral row
are either resorbed or incorporated in anläge V of the proter. Anlage I of the proter originates
from the anterior end of the reorganizing parental paroral membrane, while anläge I of the
opisthe develops at the anterior end of the anläge for the undulating membranes (Fig. 160k;
395m). The origin of the anlagen is summarized in table 143.
In middle, late and very late dividers, the cirri commence to differentiate and migrate to their
specific positions (Fig. 160 1, m, o; 395n-p). Figures 160m, o and 395p show that the
frontoventral (amphisiellid median cirral) row is assembled from sections of the three
rightmost cirral anlagen: the anterior section of anläge VI (= frontoterminal cirri), usually
comprising six or seven cirri, forms the anterior portion of the frontoventral row; the middle
portion is formed by the anterior section of anläge IV and consists of only one cirrus (IV/3)
slipping between the frontoterminal cirri and the cirri of anläge V, which form the posterior
portion of the frontoventral row. The postoral cirrus originates from anläge IV and migrates
backwards to the oral vertex, while the posterior cirri of anläge VI become the pretransverse
cirri ahead of the right transverse cirrus. No parental cirri are transmitted to the next generation.

The marginal rows and the nuclear apparatus develop in the usual manner. The parental
adoral zone of membranelles remains unchanged, while the paroral and endoral as well as the
phäryngeal fibres are reorganized. Ontogenesis of the dorsal infraciliature occurs in the
Oxytricha pattern (FOISSNER & ADAM 1983b, BERGER 1999), that is, kineties 1-3 originate by
proliferation within the parental kineties, kinety 4 separates (fragmentates) from row 3 in late
dividers, and kineties 5 and 6 originate dorsomarginally, that is, near or from the right
marginal row (Fig. 160m-p).

Fig. 160q, r. Homology of cirri in oxytrichids, Gastrostyla, and amphisiellids, exemplified in Oxytricha granulifera (q) and
Gastrostyla (Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea (r). The cirri forming the frontoventral row are connected by dotted lines; those
forming the anterior, respectively, posterior portion are connected by bold dotted lines. Designation of cirri is according to
BERGER (1999). Briefly, Roman numerals I-VI designate fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen; Arabic numerals designate
cirri within individual anlagen beginning from rear end (thus, transverse cirri are numbered with 1). In Gastrostyla mystacea
mystacea only those cirri of the frontoventral row are designated which are homologous with the cirri of Oxytricha
granulifera. Cirri in quotation marks cannot be homologized unequivocally. The upper arrow between the two figures means
"evolution of 18-cirri oxytrichids from a Gastrostyla by loss of cirri within the frontoventral row". The lower arrow means
"evolution of a Gastrostyla from an 18-cirri oxytrichid by secondary increase of cirral number within the frontoventral row".
Note that the postoral cirrus (IV/2) is at exactly the same location in both species and, for example, Hemiamphisiella
terricola.
recognize the alignment of the frontoventral row; thus, this paper is not considered further.
Here we focus on (i) the participation of postoral cirri in anlagen formation, (ii) the origin of
the cirral anlagen I-VI, and (iii) the alignment of the frontoventral cirral row. The differences
present in these features induced us to divide Gastrostyla in three subgenera.
(i) In G. (Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea (Fig. 160h-k) and G. (Gastrostyla) steinii (Fig. 31c—
e in HEMBERGER 1982), only those cirri of the posterior portion of the frontoventral row
which are close behind the oral vertex contribute to cirral anlagen. Even in late dividers some
rear cirri of the parental frontoventral row are recognizable (Fig. 160m and 31e, f in
HEMBERGER 1982). By contrast, in G. (Kleinstyla) bavariensis and G. (Gastrostyla?)
dorsicirrata all cirri of the posterior portion of the frontoventral row transform to anlagen
735

(Fig. 161b, c). Accordingly, only the
anterior, ontogenetically active cirri of
the posterior portion of the frontoventral
row are retained in species with a short
frontoventral row. This suggests that a
long frontoventral row is the plesio-
morphic state and a short row the apo-
morphic one. Unfortunately, secondary
lengthening of the row cannot be
excluded.
(ii) The origin of the fronto-ventral-
transverse cirral anlagen I-VI of G.
(Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea is
summarized in table 143. Gastrostyla
(Kleinstyla) bavariensis obviously has
the same pattern (Table 143). Anlage IV
of the proter originates, like in G.
(Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea, from
the middle portion of the frontoventral
row; however, in G. (Kleinstyla) bava-
riensis this portion is composed of three

Gastrostyla, and e.g., Hemiamphisiella terricola.
1999).
The formation of the cirral anlagen in G. (Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea differs from that in
Gastrostyla (Gastrostyla) steinii in several respects (Fig. 160a—1; 391k-y, 392a-n, p-r, 393 1-
y, 394a-j; HEMBERGER 1982, WALKER & GRIM 1973): first, anläge II of the opisthe of G.
(Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea extends, like in some oxytrichids with 18 fronto-ventral-
transverse cirri, above proter's oral vertex (Fig. 160h-j). By contrast, anläge II terminates
behind the oral vertex in G. (Gastrostyla) steinii (Fig. 159c, h, j; 391u-y, 393o-r). Second,
the anteriormost cirri of the posterior portion of the frontoventral row of G. (Spetastyla)
mystacea mystacea are involved in anlagen formation for the opisthe. In G. (Gastrostyla)
steinii, where the posterior portion of the frontoventral row extends above the oral vertex, the
middle cirri are ontogenetically active. Third, anlagen V and VI of proter and opisthe have a
common origin (primary primordia) in G. (Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea (Fig. 160h-j),
while all cirral anlagen develop independently in G. (Gastrostyla) steinii (Fig. 159h, j).
736

(iii) Gastrostyla has a distinct frontoventral (amphisiellid median cirral) row extending from
near the distal end of the adoral zone of membranelles to near mid-body or near the transverse
cirri. In all species investigated ontogenetically, the row assembles from three portions
originating from the three rightmost anlagen, IV, V and VI. The anterior portion is formed
by the anteriorly migrating cirri of anläge VI. The middle portion of the frontoventral row
originates from anläge IV. Due to a different number of cirri assembling this part of the
frontoventral cirral row, two groups can be distinguished: group 1 with invariably only one
cirrus {Gastrostyla steinii and G. mystaced) and group 2 with about three cirri {G. bavariensis
and G. dorsicirrata). Gastrostyla sterkii, a synonym of G. pulchra, also belongs to group 2,
according to the detailed observations by WALLENGREN (1900). We use this difference, in
combination with other features, to distinguish two subgenera, Gastrostyla (Spetastyla) and
Gastrostyla (Kleinstyla). The middle cirrus is often not aligned with the anterior and posterior
portion in G. (Gastrostyla) steinii (Fig. 159a; 391a, 393a), that is, dislocated up to 3 urn
leftwards. However, the alignment is perfect in a considerable number of specimens (Fig.
159b; 391b, 393e, 1) so that this feature cannot be used to distinguish Gastrostyla (Gastro-
styla) from the other two subgenera. The posterior portion of the frontoventral row is
generated by anläge V. This portion begins above the level of the oral vertex in G. (Gastro-
styla) steinii (Fig. 159a, b), while it commences postorally in G. (Spetastyla) mystacea, G.
(Gastrostyla ?) dorsicirrata, and G. (Kleinstyla) bavariensis (Fig. 160e, 161a, 162a).
However, in both cases only postoral cirri contribute to the opisthe's anlagen formation, that
is, some ontogenetically inactive cirri occur at the anterior end of the posterior portion of the
frontoventral row of G. (Gastrostyla) steinii.
Systematic position of Gastrostyla: STEIN (1859) classified this species in
Oxytricha. STERKI (1878) recognized the relationship to Gastrostyla ENGELMANN, 1862, but
his proposal was abandoned by all later revisers (BORROR 1972a, KAHL 1932, KENT 1882),
who put the species into the urostylid genus Holosticha because the frontoventral row
resembles a midventral cirral pattern in STEIN'S illustrations (Fig. 395a, b).
Recently, Gastrostyla was classified in the amphisiellids by EIGNER & FOISSNER (1994), in
the parakahliellids by EIGNER (1997, 1999), and in the oxytrichids by TUFFRAU & FLEURY
(1994) and BERGER (1999). Here, we shall compare Gastrostyla with typical representatives
of the oxytrichids, namely Oxytricha granulifera and Onychodromopsis flexilis, and two
representatives of the amphisiellids, namely Amphisiella marioni, type of the group, and
Lamtostyla australis. All were characterized ontogenetically. Thus, it should be possible to
find homologies and synapomorphies for a proper classification of Gastrostyla. The para-
kahliellids of EIGNER (1997, 1999) are, in our opinion, a polyphyletic group making a serious
comparison impossible. Our comparison is subdivided in (j) oral primordium formation, (ii)
origin of the cirral anlagen, (iii) participation of the anterior portion of the frontoventral cirral
row in anlagen formation, (iv) alignment of the frontoventral cirral row, (v) ontogenetic
activity and migration of the postoral cirrus, and (vi) ontogenesis of the dorsal ciliarure.
(i) In Gastrostyla, the formation of the oral primordium commences, as in many oxytrichids,
near the left transverse cirrus (for example, Fig. 160g; Fig. 202j in BERGER 1999). However,
this pattern also occurs in the amphisiellid Lamtostyla (PETZ & FOISSNER 1996, VOSS 1992).
The oral primordium of several other amphisiellids originates along the amphisiellid median
cirral row (WICKLOW 1982, EIGNER & FOISSNER 1994). However, a similar pattern can be
found in several oxytrichids, where the primordium originates near the postoral cirri or in the
area between the postoral and transverse cirri (BERGER 1999). Accordingly, this feature
737

hardly provides insight into the systematic position of Gastrostyla.
(ii) Gastrostyla mystacea mystacea forms the fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen from
several distinct parts of the parental ciliature and the oral primordium. Surprisingly, the origin
of the anlagen is largely identical to those of typical oxytrichids (Fig. 160q-u; Table 143) and
amphisiellids. This indicates homology of the structures involved. In Amphisiella marioni, the
exact origin of the anlagen is not known (WiCKLOW 1982). Thus, we used Hemiamphisiella
terricola, as described by EIGNER and FOISSNER (1994), as an example (Table 143). In
Gastrostyla mystacea only two anlagen and in G. steinii none of the anlagen are formed via
primary primordia. The same pattern occurs in amphisiellids (EIGNER & FOISSNER 1994).
Thus, the origin of the cirral anlagen hardly provides insight into the systematic position of
Gastrostyla, but suggests that both, oxytrichids and amphisiellids, are closely related.
(iii) In oxytrichids with 18 or less fronto-ventral-transverse cirri, the frontoterminal cirri
(cirrus VI/3 and VI/4 in figure 160q) are never involved in cirral anlagen formation (for
review, see BERGER 1999). The same applies to G. steinii, type of the genus, according to
HEMBERGER (1985) and our investigations (Fig. 159a—j; 392a, b, 394v, x). The anterior
portion of its frontoventral row is formed by 3-6, on average four cirri (median, n = 40). In
most middle dividers, where anlagen formation is complete, four parental cirri (median, n =
40) are still recognizable, strongly suggesting that this portion of the frontoventral row is
ontogenetically inactive. In G. mystacea mystacea the situation is less clear. In morphostatic
specimens, the anterior portion of the frontoventral row is composed of seven cirri, while
middle dividers have only five parental cirri in this position (Fig. 160j, k, m, o), indicating
that, on average, two cirri are involved in anlagen formation or resorbed (Fig. 160g-j).
Certainly, such details are difficult to study. However, we never found a Gastrostyla divider
unequivocally showing cirral anlagen formation by cirri of the anterior portion of the
frontoventral row, while this is common in several amphisiellids, such as Par amphisiella
caudata and Hemiamphisiella terricola (EIGNER & FOISSNER 1994). Others, however, do not
include these cirri in any anlagen, for instance, Amphisiellides illuvialis. Thus, this feature
also does not provide reliable insight into the systematic position of Gastrostyla.
(iv) As described above and discussed in paragraph (iii) of the ontogenetic comparison,
Gastrostyla forms a frontoventral row composed of three portions (Fig. 159k, 160o, r; 392f,
394h, i, 395p). This highly characteristic pattern is the key feature of the family Amphisielli-
dae as defined by EIGNER & FOISSNER (1994), strongly suggesting homology of the
processes. In fact, this was the reason why EIGNER & FOISSNER (1994) transferred Gastro-
styla to the Amphisiellidae. However, the three portions of the gastrostylid frontoventral row
can also be plausibly correlated with the oxytrichid cirral pattern, although this is less obvious
due to the strongly reduced number of cirri (Fig. 160q, r). In fact, this was already suggested
by WALLENGREN (1900). Again, this feature does not provide insight into the systematic
position of Gastrostyla.
(v) Gastrostyla has a rather prominent postoral cirrus originating from anläge IV and
migrating towards the oral vertex in late dividers (Fig. 159k, 160e, o). In early dividers, this
cirrus forms anläge IV of the opisthe (Fig. 160i, j). Oxytricha granulifera has a cirrus in the
same position (Fig. 160q), and this cirrus also originates from anläge IV and migrates towards
the oral vertex in late dividers (Fig. 160u). In early dividers, it also forms anläge IV of the
opisthe (Fig. 160s, t; Table 143). At first glance, the agreement in position, migration, and
ontogenetic potential indicates homology. However, the amphisiellids Hemiamphisiella and
Pseudouroleptus also have a cirrus in the same position, and this cirrus also originates from
738

anläge IV and migrates towards the oral vertex in late dividers. In early dividers it is
incorporated in the oral primordium, which forms cirral anlagen I-FV. Obviously, feature (v)
hardly provides insight into the systematic position of Gastrostyla, but strongly suggests that
both have a common ancestor, as emphasized by the dorsal ontogenesis discussed in the next
paragraph.

(vi) Dorsal ontogenesis is considered an important feature for reconstructing phylogenetic
relationships in hypotrichs because the strongly reduced ciliature is likely subjected to
reduced environmental pressure (MARTIN 1982, FOISSNER & ADAM 1983b, BERGER &
FOISSNER 1997, BERGER 1999). In oxytrichids, the occurrence of dorsal kinety fragmentation
is a highly characteristic feature (FOISSNER & ADAM 1983b, BERGER 1999). And exactly this
special pattern is found in Gastrostyla (Fig. 160p; 392p, r, 393w, 394b-d). Unfortunately,
many oxytrichid genera do not show dorsal kinety fragmentation and a "typical" amphisiellid,
Pseudouroleptus caudatus HEMBERGER, 1985, has fragmentation like a "typical" Oxytricha
(HEMBERGER 1982).While the first problem can be reasonably explained by assuming a
secondary loss, the case of Pseudouroleptus remains enigmatic. BERGER (1999) "solved" the
problem by classifying Pseudouroleptus caudatus with the oxytrichids, without, however,
convincing evidence.
None of the features (iMvO discussed in the previous paragraphs unequivocally assigns
Gastrostyla to the amphisiellids or oxytrichids, but all can be homologized within these three
groups, strongly suggesting a common ancestor. BERGER (1999) discusses two positions of
Gastrostyla within the oxytrichids: (i) Gastrostyla is the sister group of the 18-cirrri oxy-
trichids, that is, the 18-cirral pattern evolved from the Gastrostyla-pattern by a reduction of
the (ontogenetically inactive) cirri of the frontoventral row (Fig. 160r —> 160q). This
"primitive" position is widely assumed, for example, by KAHL (1932), MARTIN (1982), and
WiRNSBERGER et al. (1986); (ii) Gastrostyla evolved from flexible 18-cirri oxytrichids (for
example, Oxytricha) by an (secondary) increase of the number of cirri originating in anlagen
IV to VI (Fig. 160q —> 160r). Hopefully, gene sequence data will provide further insight into
the proper relationships of oxytrichids, amphisiellids and Gastrostyla, which is certainly a key
group within the hypotrichs.

mystacea mystacea, to which the reader thus is referred. The cirral pattern is also very similar
in the two subspecies, except for the morphometrics marked in table 142. Separation of dorsal
kinety 4 from kinety 3 is often incomplete (Fig. 161c), as in Gastrostyla dorsicirrata
(BERGER 1999). The number of caudal cirri associated with dorsal kinety 4 is frequently
difficult to ascertain because they are very close to the marginal cirri: the majority has one
caudal cirrus (Fig. 161c), the rest have two (Fig. 161e). The formation of the amphisiellid
median (frontoventral) cirral row proceeds as in G. mystacea mystacea, that is, the middle
portion of the row is composed of cirrus IV/3 only (Fig. 161f, g).
The Namibian specimens agree with the original description of G. minima in most main
features, namely, body length (130 urn respectively 120-145 urn), nuclear apparatus, length
of adoral zone, number of adoral membranelles (28-32 respectively 32-35), arrangement of
undulating membranes, arrangement and number (24-29 respectively 27 according to Fig.
161a) of fronto-ventral-transverse cirri (cp. figures 161a, b), number of right (16-32
respectively 28-33) and left (24-30 respectively 28-31) marginal cirri, habitat (soil respec-
tively soil and freshwater), and Gondwanan distribution (Africa respectively South America).
There are also, as is usual, some differences: (i) HEMBERGER's specimens are wider than ours
(45-60 urn respectively 27-42 urn) and seemingly lack cortical granules. HEMBERGER used
WlLBERT's protargol method, where specimens sometimes become rather inflated and cortical
granules rarely impregnate. In the specimens from Namibian site (73) the cortical granules
impregnate only faintly, while they stain heavily in the site (49) specimens. HEMBERGER
(1985), who obviously did not study live specimens in detail, likely simply overlooked the
cortical granules, (ii) HEMBERGER invariably counted three caudal cirri, while about one third
of our specimens has two cirri associated with dorsal kinety 4 and thus has four caudal cirri.
HEMBERGER correctly stated that the caudal cirri are inconspicuous and the last cirri of the left
marginal row are reduced in size. Thus, it cannot be excluded that he overlooked kinety 4
sometimes having two cirri, (iii) HEMBERGER counted "3 plus 2 x W dorsal kineties,
indicating that his population lacks kinety 6, which is usually composed of only one or two
bristles only in our population. However, we also found specimens which lack this short row
(Table 142). (iv) The cirral bases in HEMBERGER's drawing (Fig. 161a) are distinctly larger
than those in our figures, likely because he illustrated the individual basal bodies, which
makes cirral bases larger due to spatial constraints. The slightly different number of caudal
cirri and the lack of the short dorsal kinety 6 could also be interpreted as early speciation
events of these geographically widely separated populations (Africa vs. South America).
Generally, such details are largely unknown and should be investigated in combination with
gene sequence and/or enzymatic data.
Occurrence and ecology: HEMBERGER (1985) discovered Gastrostyla mystacea
minima in Peruvian freshwater; later, he observed high abundances in soil from this region.
We found large numbers of G. (Spetastyla) mystacea minima at Namibian site (73), while it
was sparse at site (49). The data indicate that the subspecies minima may be restricted to
Gondwanaland (South America and Africa), whereas the subspecies mystacea possibly occurs
in Eurasia only, at least according to the records substantiated by illustrations (STEIN 1859,
SHI et al. 1999, present paper).

Cortical granules in closely spaced rows, in vivo hardly recognizable but deeply stained with

near mid-body. 6 dorsal kineties with one caudal cirrus each at kineties 1, 2, 4.
Fig. 162a-d. Gastrostyla (Kleinstyla) bavariensis (about 90 urn), ventral views of morphostatic (a) and dividing (b-d)
specimens (from FOISSNER 1997b). This species is very similar to G. (Spetastyla) mystacea minima (Fig. 161a-g), but differs,
inter alia, by the shorter frontoventral (amphisiellid median) cirral row (FVR) and the typical oxytrichid pretrans-
verse/transverse cirral pattern composed of five transverse cirri and each one pretransverse cirrus ahead of the two rightmost
transverse cirri (dotted lines). Figures (162b, c) show that anlagen formation is very similar to that of G. (Spetastyla) mystacea
mystacea (Fig. 160i, j). Arrows on solid line mark postoral cirrus IV/2. The arrowheads denote the middle portion of the
frontoventral row; in G. (Kleinstyla) bavariensis (Fig. 162a) and G. (Gastrostyla?) dorsicirrata (Fig. 162e, 0» this portion is
composed of three cirri, which are transformed to anläge IV of the proter (Fig. 162b, c). Asterisks in (b) mark anterior end of
anlagen (primary primordia) V and VI for both the proter and the opisthe. Arrow on dotted lines in (d) denotes migration of

Type location: Benthos of the Röslau, a
clean, periodically acidified brook in the Fich-
telgebirge, Bavaria, about 2.5 km down-
stream the spring, 50°N 12°E.
Etymology: Named after the country dis-
covered.
Description, discussion, and com-
parison with related species: Des-
cription, see FOISSNER (1997b), who identi-
fied, with some reservation, this population
with Gastrostyla minima HEMBERGER [now
—> G. (Spetastyla) mystacea minima; Fig.
161a]. Our data show that HEMBERGER'S
species produces only one cirrus for the
middle portion of the frontoventral (amphi-
siellid median cirral) row, while three or
more cirri are generated in G. bavariensis
(Fig. 162d) and G. dorsicirrata (Fig. 162f).
For further details, see ontogenetic compari-
son under G. (Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea.
Morphologically, Gastrostyla (Kleinstyla)
bavariensis and G. (Spetastyla) mystacea
minima are distinguished by three rather
sophisticated but distinct features, namely,
the number of cirri in the posterior portion of
the frontoventral row (5-6 vs. 6-8, usually
Fig. 162e, f. Gastrostyla (Gastrostylal) dorsicirrata, 7), the length of the frontoventral row
infraciliature of ventral side of dividing specimens after (ending near mid-body vs. near transverse
protargol impregnation (from BERGER 1999). In this
cirri), and the number of pretransverse cirri
species, the middle portion of the frontoventral row is com-
posed of three cirri (arrow on dotted line), as in G. (invariably one ahead of each of the two
(Kleinstyla) bavariensis (Fig. 162d); thus, it likely belongs rightmost transverse cirri vs. 2-3 ahead the
to the subgenus Kleinstyla. Arrow on broken line denotes
rightmost transverse cirrus, forming short but
migration of opisthe's postoral cirrus to oral vertex. I, VI -
fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen. Body length distinct row). These three features are recog-
135 urn. nizable also in a Venezuelan population
studied recently (Fig. 396a-c). Furthermore,
the cortical granules of G. (Kleinstyla) bavari-
ensis are much less distinct in vivo than those of G. (Spetastyla) mystacea mystacea and G.
mystacea minima. However, the most important feature is, of course, the subgeneric
character, namely, the three cirri comprising the middle portion of the frontoventral row.
Occurrence and ecology: Possibly confined to freshwater. For some faunistic and
ecological data, see FOISSNER (1997b). Recently found in a soil sample from Venezuela (Fig.
396a-c).

Oxytricha longa GELEI & SZABADOS, 1950 (Fig. 163a-d; 381p, 390g; Tables
144, 145)
The Namibian population of Oxytricha longa is highly similar to the original description
(GELEI & SZABADOS 1950; Fig. 163f) and the redescription by GANNER et al. (1987; Fig.
163e), who originally identified their populations as Urosomoida agiliformis FOISSNER, 1982.
BERGER & FOISSNER (1997) and BERGER (1999), however, classified populations 3 and 4 of
GANNER et al. (1987) in O. longa because (i) primordia V and VI of the proter originate, as in
Oxytricha granulifera FOISSNER & ADAM, 1983b (type of Oxytricha), from postoral cirri V/3
and V/4 (vs. de novo in U. agiliformis) and (ii) they have four transverse and two pretrans-
verse cirri (vs. two, respectively, one in U. agiliformis). Now we found further morphometric
differences between these species (Table 144). The smaller relative length of the nuclear
figure in Oxytricha longa is due to the small distance between the macronuclear nodules. This
feature and the higher number of transverse plus pretransverse cirri (usually 6 vs. usually 3)
can be used to distinguish Oxytricha longa and Urosomoida agiliformis with high accuracy in
vivo and in protargol preparations. Accordingly, the population recently described by OLMO
& PEREZ-UZ (2000) from a wastewater treatment plant in Spain belongs not to U. agiliformis,
but to O. longa.

Oxytricha similis ENGELMANN, 1862, which is also very similar to 0. longa in size and shape,
has five transverse cirri (Fig. 163i). However, this has to be confirmed by detailed data from
protargol-impregnated specimens (BERGER 1999). Oxytricha granulifera quadricirrata
BLATTERER & FOISSNER, 1988 has, like O. longa, only four transverse cirri (Fig. 163h);
however, it is easily distinguished from O. longa by the cortical granules and the rear
frontoventral cirrus (cirrus IV/3), which is distinctly set off from the other cirri (close to the
other cirri in O. longa).
Taking the available (GELEI & SZABADOS 1950; GANNER et al. 1987, population 3; OLMO &
PEREZ-UZ 2000) and present data, Oxytricha longa can be characterized as follows: Size 60-
100 x 20-40 urn in vivo (47-77 x 13-30 urn in protargol slides); outline elliptical to elongate
elliptical; 2 almost abutting macronuclear nodules, 2 micronuclei; 18-25 adoral membra-
nelles, 10-23 (M = 15-22) right marginal cirri, 14-23 (M = 16-20) left marginal cirri, 3
frontal cirri, 4 frontoventral cirri, 1 buccal cirrus, 3 postoral cirri, 2 pretransverse cirri, 4
transverse cirri, 2 caudal cirri, 4 dorsal kineties. The Namibian population stands out by its
numerous cytoplasmic crystals (Fig. 163a; 38lp) and the highly saline habitat. Thus, and to
document the similarity of widely distant ciliate populations, we provide a detailed descrip-
tion.
Description of population from Namibian site (69): Size 70-90 x 20-35
um in vivo, length:width ratio 2.8-4.9:1 in vivo, 2.3-3.4:1 after protargol impregnation.
Elliptical to elongate elliptical, that is, both ends rounded (Fig. 163a, b); flexible but
acontractile. Macronuclear nodules in body centre left of midline, ellipsoidal (2-3:1), on
average near 2:1 and very close together. Two micronuclei about 3.5 urn across in vivo, one
attached to each macronuclear nodule in variable positions. No cortical granules. Cytoplasm
colourless, usually with many crystals of ordinary shape and size (Fig. 163a; 381p); crystals
less abundant in specimens from site (58). Feeds on bacteria and flagellates digested in
vacuoles about 7 urn across. Moderately fast gliding movement.
Cirral pattern rather constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 163c, d; 390g; Table
145). Transverse and caudal cirri 17-20 urn long and thus prominent, other cirri about 10 urn
long in vivo. Right marginal row commences near level of last frontoventral cirrus and is
slightly (5 urn) shortened posteriorly, left marginal row often terminates at rear, near midline.
Frontal and transverse cirri slightly larger than other cirri. Buccal cirrus right of anterior end
of paroral and ahead of endoral. Frontoventral cirri in ordinary, hook-shaped pattern. Postoral
cirri also in ordinary pattern, occasionally the rear or the rear and the middle cirrus are
lacking (specimens with only one postoral cirrus occur very rarely and were excluded from
morphometry). Both pretransverse ventral cirri close to J-shaped transverse cirri.
Dorsal bristles about 4 urn long in vivo (6 urn in specimens from site 58), arranged in four
rows: rows 1 and 2 distinctly, respectively, slightly shortened anteriorly and with a caudal

portion of adoral zone almost completely and bears paroral membrane (Fig. 163b). Undu-
lating membranes slightly curved and almost parallel to each other after protargol impregna-
tion, endoral on average 10 urn long, paroral 8 urn and commencing about 2 urn ahead of
endoral at level of buccal cirrus (Table 145); both membranes likely composed of dikinetids,
paroral cilia about 5 urn long. Pharyngeal fibres of ordinary length.
Morphogenesis proceeds in the Oxytricha pattern (BERGER 1999) and as in population 3 of
GANNER et al. (1987), that is, primordia V and VI of the proter originate from the postoral
cirri. By contrast, these primordia originate de novo in Urosomoida (FOISSNER & ADAM
1983a). In the Spanish population, the relevant stages are not shown.
Occurrence and ecology: GELEI & SZABADOS (1950; Fig. 163f) discovered
Oxytricha longa in a rain-water puddle in the town of Szeged, Hungary, while GANNER et al.
(1987) found it in a polluted river in Salzburg, Austria (Fig. 163e) and a meadow soil from
Israel. In Namibia, Oxytricha longa occurred in several highly saline, not strictly edaphic sites
(Table 4). Abundances were high in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures showing that it is a
truly euryhaline ciliate occurring both in limnetic and edaphic habitats.

Vermioxytricha nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Oxytrichidae EHRENBERG, 1838 with bipartite adoral zone of membranelles,
undulating membranes side by side, and frontoventral cirri in V-shaped pattern. Postoral,
pretransverse, transverse, and caudal cirri lacking. Frontal and frontoventral cirri originate
from 5 anlagen, the rightmost of which is a primary primordium. Dorsal morphogenesis in
Urosomoida pattern.
Type species: Vermioxytricha arenicola nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun vermis (worm) and the Greek generic name
Oxytricha (pointed hair ~ cirrus), referring to the slender body and the relationship with
Oxytricha BORY DE SAINT-VINCENT, 1824. Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera: Vermioxytricha is established for a new species
described below and Hemisincirra muelleri FoiSSNER, 1986. The overall features (slender
body, reduced number of cirri, soil habitat) of these species are highly similar to Hemi-
sincirra. However, the type species of that genus, Uroleptus kahli BuiTKAMP, 1977b, has
transverse cirri, which are lacking in Vermioxytricha, and the lack of a certain cirral group is
commonly used as a generic feature (BERGER & FOISSNER 1997).
Vermioxytricha is very likely an oxytrichid ciliate because the frontal ciliature and onto-
genesis are basically as in that group, except that not the usual six, but only five frontoventral
cirral anlagen are generated. However, five anlagen also occur in two other new oxytrichid
genera, namely —> Hemiurosoma and —» Erimophrya. An oxytrichid relationship is also
emphasized by the urosomoid dorsal ontogenesis. All species of these three genera have a
749

reduced number of postoral cirri, namely 0, 1, or 2 vs. 3 in ordinary oxytrichids. In most
oxytrichids, the postoral cirri (IV/2, V/3, V/4) are formed by the anlagen IV and V, while the
frontoventral cirri (III/2, IV/3, VI/3, VI/4) originate from the anlagen III, IV, and VI (see
figure 6a in BERGER 1999 for designation of cirri). Primordium V has a special position
because all of its descendants are located postorally during interphase. This suggests that
Vermioxytricha, which lacks postoral, pretransverse, and transverse cirri, secondarily lost
anläge V. Furthermore, Vermioxytricha does not form cirrus IV/2, which is the third postoral
cirrus in species with a full set of postorals. The fifth (= rightmost) anläge of Vermioxytricha
is obviously homologous with anläge VI of ordinary oxytrichids, as indicated by the
formation of the characteristic, ontogenetically inactive frontoterminal (migratory) cirri.
Vermioxytricha is likely related to Oxytricha, as indicated by the V-like arranged
frontoventral cirri and some ontogenetic features, for example, the formation of proter's
anläge II from the buccal cirrus, anläge III from the cirrus behind the right frontal cirrus,
anläge IV from the rear frontoventral cirrus (IV/3), and anläge V from anläge V of the opisthe
(Fig. 165c). By contrast, Hemiurosoma is obviously closely related to Urosoma (Urosoma
pattern of frontoventral cirri; almost all frontal, ventral, and transverse cirri originate from
primary primordia). This suggests that the ordinary oxytrichid anläge V was lost independ-
ently at least twice. Accordingly, the feature cannot be used to split the family, which now
contains almost 30 genera (BERGER 1999 and present study).
Vermioxytricha differs from Hemiurosoma by the lack of transverse and caudal cirri, the
arrangement of the frontoventral cirri (V-shaped vs. Urosoma pattern), and the lower number
of primary primordia (1 vs. 4). Erimophrya species have postoral, transverse, and caudal cirri,
and are thus also easily distinguished from Vermioxytricha species. Circinella species, which,
like Vermioxytricha lack, transverse and caudal cirri, usually have a rather long frontoventral
row composed of many cirri. Thus, they resemble amphisiellids. Furthermore, the type
species, Circinella arenicola, generates an oral primordium extending from mid-body to
proter's frontal area, and the frontoventral cirri originate from only four anlagen (FOISSNER
1994a). Thus, Circinella and Vermioxytricha are distinct taxa, likely even belonging to
different families.
Vermioxytricha species not only have a strongly reduced ventral ciliature (no postoral,
pretransverse, and transverse cirri), but also a sparse dorsal infraciliature, namely only one
bipolar kinety and a very short row near the anterior end. In spite of this, ontogenesis matches
the Urosomoida pattern, that is, the single bipolar kinety (vs. three in the ordinary Uro-
somoida pattern) divides by within-proliferation, while the short row is generated dorso-
marginally.
As mentioned above, a Hemisincirra species has to be transferred to the new genus: Vermi-
oxytricha muelleri (FOISSNER, 1986) nov. comb, (basionym: Hemisincirra muelleri FOISSNER,
1986). We checked all other Hemisincirra species listed by BERGER (2001) to see whether or
not some of them belong to Vermioxytricha. However, most of them have, like the type
species of Hemisincirra, transverse cirri and thus cannot be included in Vermioxytricha. The
absence of transverse cirri in Hemisincirra vermiculare HEMBERGER, 1985 is uncertain, and
—• Hemisincirra rariseta very likely lacks a buccal cirrus; hence, both species should remain
in Hemisincirra, which includes mostly small, slender species that do not fit into any other
genus well.

Vermioxytricha arenicola nov. spec. (Fig 164a-z, 165a, b; 397a-n; Table 146)
Diagnosis: Size about 170 x 17 urn in vivo; vermiform. Usually 13-16 macronuclear
nodules in single strand left of midline. Cortical granules around cirri and dorsal bristles and
scattered in short rows, about 1 urn across and yellowish. On average 43—46 right and 39 left
marginal cirri. Adoral zone occupies 12-14% of body length, comprises 3 frontal and 14-15
ventral membranelles. Invariably 1 bipolar and 1 very short dorsal kinety near anterior end.
Type location: Humous sand under Acacia erioloba trees (Camel thorn) in the Sossus
Vlei of the Namib Desert, 24°50'S 15°20'E (site 24 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective arenicola (living in sand) refers to the preferred habitat.
Description: Two populations were studied, namely from Tunisia and from Namibian
site (24). They agree so well in all features that conspecificity is beyond reasonable doubt
(Table 146). Thus, the diagnosis and description contain data from both populations.
Size 120-220 x 12-25 urn in vivo, usually about 170 x 17 urn, length:width ratio around 10:1
on average both in vivo and in protargol preparations (Table 146), flattened only in oral area;
acontractile, occasionally slightly twisted about main body axis. Vermiform with anterior
portion slightly narrowed and inconspicuously bulged where the adoral zone enters the buccal
cavity; posterior region usually tail-like and more or less distinctly curved with slight, but
typical subterminal notch at right side (Fig. 164a-g; 397a, g). Nuclear apparatus in central
quarters of cell. Macronuclear nodules in single strand left of midline, individual nodules
usually elongate ellipsoidal, rarely globular or ellipsoidal; nucleoli minute. Usually 2-4
globular micronuclei along macronuclear strand. Contractile vacuole with distinct collecting
canals above mid-body at left cell margin. Cortex thin and flexible, contains granules around
cirral and dorsal bristles bases, but also scattered in bare areas; individual granules about 1
urn across and yellowish, usually impregnate distinctly with the protargol method used; when
methyl green-pyronin is added, they become red but are not released; underneath cortex
ellipsoidal, about 2 (am-sized, pale structures, likely mitochondria (Fig. 164h, i; 397g, i, j).
Cytoplasm colourless, packed with lipid droplets 1-2 urn across and some vacuoles with a
single crystal each. Food vacuoles 5 urn across, contain rod-shaped bacteria, yeast cells, short
fungal hyphae, and debris. Moves rapidly and serpentinely on microscope slide and between
soil particles, showing great flexibility; if numerous, the whirling bodies produce a curious
spectacle.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability, except for the number of marginal cirri,
which varies distinctly in the Tunisian specimens (Fig. T64a, j-1, o-q; 397a, f, g, h; Table
146). Most cirri only about 8-10 um long and fine, each usually consisting of only two or
four cilia. Right marginal row slightly shortened and extending dorsolaterally anteriorly, ends
subterminally; left row of Tunisian specimens usually terminates with three closely spaced
cirri at rear end. Frontal cirri of about same size as other cirri, in subapical, oblique row, first
(= left) cirrus invariably in or near gap between frontal and ventral adoral membranelles.
Frontoventral row right of midline, ends slightly to distinctly above oral vertex, usually
composed of only three cirri, namely the two frontoterminal cirri and the single cirrus
originating from anläge IV. Majority of specimens with a single cirrus left of frontoventral
row, rarely specimens without cirrus or with two cirri occur. Buccal cirrus in corner of
•751

undulating membranes, usually composed of two cilia only. Postoral and transverse cirri
lacking.
Dorsal bristles about 2 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows: row 1 bipolar, slightly
shortened anteriorly and posteriorly; row 2 usually composed of only two basal body pairs
near anterior right end of cell. Caudal cirri lacking (Fig. 164m, p; 397a, c-e; Table 146).
Adoral zone inconspicuous because occupying only 12-14% of body length, three frontal and
14-15 ventral membranelles of ordinary fine structure separated by a distinct gap at left
anterior body corner. Buccal field narrow and flat; buccal lip covers proximal adoral
membranelles. Paroral and endoral membrane almost straight, close together, staggered, and
likely composed of monokinetids. Pharynx without peculiarities (Fig. 164a, b, e, j-1, o, p;
397a-e, g, h; Table 146).

Ontogenesis (Fig. 164o-z, 165a, b; 397k-n): Division, studied in specimens from type
location, is similar to that of oxytrichids (for a review, see BERGER 1999), but simpler due to
the reduced number of anlagen and cirri.
Ontogenesis commences with the formation of a long, narrow oral primordium slightly above
mid-body (Fig. 164n, o). Then, four cirral anlagen streaks in forked pattern arise from the
anterior end of the oral primordium, where adoral membranelles are already assembled (Fig.
164r-t; 397k, 1). Next, the rightmost cirral anläge splits transversely to produce an anläge
each for the frontoterminal cirri of the proter and opisthe; thus, this streak is a primary
primordium (Fig. 164t, u; long arrow; 397 1). Furthermore, the parental undulating mem-
branes begin to reorganize, and the buccal cirrus, the cirrus behind the right frontal cirrus, and
the rear frontoventral cirrus modify to proter's anlagen I to IV.
In middle dividers, five frontoventral cirral anlagen streaks are recognizable both in proter
and opisthe (Fig. 164v, x, y; 397 1). In late dividers, frontoventral cirri begin to segregate and
arrange to the species-specific pattern, showing that neither postoral nor pretransverse and
transverse cirri are formed (Fig. 164z, 165a; 397m). On average, the following number of cirri

is formed by the anlagen I-V: 1, 2, 2, 1,2. Nuclear division and ontogenesis of the remaining
ventral ciliature occur in the usual manner (Fig. 164w-z, 165a, b; 397n).
Formation of the dorsal ciliature commences with the production of two anlagen within
parental kinety 1 (Fig. 164w). Later, a very short dorsomarginal kinety (= kinety 2) develops
at/near the anterior end of the right marginal cirral anlagen (Fig. 164z, 165a). No caudal cirri
are generated (Fig. 165b).
Occurrence and ecology: Great numbers of Vermioxytricha arenicola developed in
the non-flooded Petri dish cultures from type location and nearby (Table 4), indicating the
presence of many resting cysts and optimal growth conditions. The Tunisian sample, kindly
provided by Prof. Dr. Thomas PEER from Salzburg University, was an alkaline (pH 8.1),
cyanobacteria-covered crust soil mixed with red sand and some litter from drifting sand of the
eastern part of the Grand Erg, 33°N 09°E. Vermioxytricha arenicola is well adapted to the
sandy habitat by its vermiform shape, and is thus rather common in the dunes of the Namib
Desert (Table 4).
Comparison with related species: Vermioxytricha arenicola is likely the sister
species of V. muelleri (FOISSNER, 1986), which also occurs in Namibia, differing only by the
cortical granules, distinct organelles we use as a species feature. —> Hemisincirra rariseta,
which has the same size, shape, and nuclear apparatus, also lacks cortical granules, and is thus
easily confused with V. muelleri. However, Hemisincirra rariseta has more cirri in the frontal
field (12 vs. 8), likely lacks a buccal cirrus, has fewer marginal cirri (around 26 per row vs.
around 40), and two bipolar dorsal kineties (vs. one bipolar and one strongly reduced kinety
in V. arenicola). There are several other, rather similar species discussed under —> Hemi-
sincirra rariseta. In vivo, Vermioxytricha arenicola is recognizable by the vermiform shape,
the strand-like nuclear figure, the cortical granules, and the two dorsal bristle rows, one of
which is strongly reduced. However, identification should be checked in protargol prepara-
tions.
Apourosomoida nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Oxytrichidae EHRENBERG, 1838 with adoral zone formed like a question mark
and interrupted by a minute gap at left anterior corner of body. Undulating membranes in
Gonostomum pattern. Frontoventral cirri in V-shaped pattern; originate from five anlagen, of
which the rightmost are primary primordia. Number of postoral cirri increased to a conspicu-
ous row, originating from anläge IV. Single transverse cirrus produced by rightmost anläge V.
1 right and 1 left row of marginal cirri. 2 dorsal kineties, each with a caudal cirrus; proter
kineties originate from ordinary anlagen, while opisthe's kinety 1 is generated by posterior
fragmentation of kinety 2.
Type species: Apourosomoida halophila nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the generic name
Urosomoida. Feminine gender.
Species assignable: The genus is monotypic. However, Urosomoida minima
HEMBERGER, 1985 (Fig. 171e) might belong to Apourosomoida, as indicated by the gap in the
759

adoral zone and the reduced dorsal infraciliature, unfortunately not shown in detail by
HEMBERGER. Cladotricha variabilis, as redescribed by BORROR & EVANS (1979), also has
features resembling A. halophila. However, it likely produces six fronto-ventral-transverse
cirral anlagen and an additional short row of postoral cirri. Thus, it might be a new genus
related to Apourosomoida (see also discussion of Cladotricha below). Unfortunately, the
genesis of the dorsal infraciliature was insufficiently described. Data from Uroleptus
natronophilus DlETZ, 1965 are also too meagre for a definite classification.
Comparison with related genera: The ontogenetic data indicate that Apouro-
somoida belongs to the Oxytrichidae, as defined by BERGER & FOISSNER (1997) and BERGER
(1999). Likely, it is related to Urosomoida and -» Erimophrya, but the unique genesis of the
postoral cirral row and the dorsal infraciliature forbids excluding that Apourosomoida belongs
to another family, or even that it is the representative of a new family. Actually, this species
shows once more that hypotrich evolution is possibly too intricate to be unravelled, both with
classical and modern methods. The family Oxytrichidae contains now almost 30 genera, an
indefensible situation for cladistic phylogeneticists. The following comparison is confined to
genera which might be confused with Apourosomoida; as concerns the oxytrichids, the major
revision by BERGER (1999) should be consulted.
Apourosomoida differs, inter alia, from Urosomoida by the adoral zone (with vs. without gap
separating frontal and ventral membranelles), the number of dorsal kineties (two vs. four), the
number of cirral anlagen (five vs. six), and the ontogenesis of the postoral cirri (from single
vs. two anlagen) and dorsal bristles {Apourosomoida vs. Urosomoida pattern).
At first glance, Apourosomoida looks similar to —>• Erimophrya because both have the same
fronto-ventral-transverse cirral pattern and both generate it from only five anlagen. However,
—> Erimophrya has distinctly reduced postoral cirri and an urosomoidal ventral and dorsal
ontogenesis. Accordingly, the great overall similarity of, especially, —» Erimophrya arenicola
is produced by homoplasy.
Apourosomoida has, like Gonostomum, Urosoma, and —> Hemiurosoma, primary primordia, a
distinct apomorphy uniting these genera to a clade in the phylogenetic system of the Oxy-
trichidae (BERGER & FOISSNER 1997, BERGER 1999). However, the primary primordia of
Apourosomoida possibly evolved convergently because, inter alia, the arrangement of the
frontoventral cirri {Urosomoida vs. Urosoma pattern) and the arrangement and genesis of the
dorsal bristles are entirely different {Apourosomoida pattern with fragmentation of kinety 2
vs. Urosomoida pattern without fragmentation but with a dorsomarginal kinety).
Apourosomoida differs from Cladotricha koltzowii (Fig. 166n), type of the genus and
redescribed by BORROR & EVANS (1979), by the transverse cirri (present vs. lacking), the
postoral cirri (present vs. lacking), and the arrangement of the frontoventral cirri {Urosomoida
vs. Cladotricha pattern). Furthermore, ontogenesis is obviously quite different in C. koltzowii
and C. halophila (BORROR & EVANS 1979, WILBERT 1995). BORROR & EVANS (1979) also
investigated Cladotricha variabilis, whose morphology and ontogenesis are quite different
from that of C. koltzowii and C. halophila, but rather similar to that of Apourosomoida,
except for the transverse cirri (lacking vs. present) and the number of fronto-ventral-
transverse cirral anlagen (likely six vs. five). Thus, C. variabilis redescribed by BORROR &
EVANS is neither congeneric with C. koltzowii nor Apourosomoida halophila (Fig. 166o-s).

Apourosomoida halophila nov. spec. (Fig. 166a-f, 167a-v; 398a-j; Table 147)
Diagnosis: Size about 100 x 20 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal with pointed posterior
end. 2 elongate ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules and 1 micronucleus. Adoral zone usually
composed of 17 membranelles occupying 20% of body length. On average about 19 cirri each
in right and left marginal row, 3 frontal cirri, 4 frontoventral cirri, 1 buccal and transverse
cirrus each, 5 cirri in postoral row, and 2 caudal cirri. Dorsal kineties 1 and 2 composed of an
average of 2, respectively, 8 bristles.
Type location: Highly saline, sandy soil from the Unjab river bed, northern Namib
Desert, Namibia, 20°10'S 13°10'E.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words hal (salt) and phil (to like), referring to the
saline environment the species prefers.
Description: Size 60-130 x 15-25 urn in vivo, usually near 100 x 20 urn, considerably
shrunken and stouter in protargol and SEM preparations, viz., 71 x 21 urn, as also indicated
by the high variation coefficient (25%; Table 147). Shape rather constant, elongate ellipsoidal
to bluntly cylindroidal with anterior end narrowly rounded and posterior rather abruptly
pointed; rarely slipper-shaped or curved specimens occur. Slightly to distinctly twisted along
main body axis and flattened up to 2:1 dorsoventrally in oral area (Fig. 166a-c, e; 398a, c-e).
Macronuclear nodules in middle third of cell left of midline, usually close together and
connected by a fine thread, ellipsoidal to cylindroidal (7:1), on average elongate ellipsoidal
(3:1); contain many small, globular nucleoli. Micronucleus lacking or not impregnated in
about 30% of specimens, others have 1 or 2 micronuclei attached to the macronuclear nodules
at variable position. No contractile vacuole recognizable. Cortex very flexible, lacks specific
granules. Cytoplasm colourless, contains up to 7 um-sized food vacuoles with bacterial
remnants, some 3-5 urn long, ordinary crystals, and pale lipid droplets up to 3 urn across
mainly in posterior body half. Glides and swims slowly on microscope slide.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability, except for frontoventral cirri, which
vary from 3-6 (Fig. 166a, e, f, 167a, n; 398d-f; Table 147). Cirri usually composed of 4-6
cilia, rarely of 2 (last cirrus of left marginal row) or 9 (frontal cirri, right caudal cirrus).
Marginal cirral rows obliquely arranged due to body torsion, right row commences subapi-
cally on dorsal side and extends onto ventral margin in mid-body to end far subterminally, left
row curves onto dorsal margin in mid-body and extends onto pointed end of cell; cirri
decrease in size and become more widely spaced in posterior third, especially in left row.
Frontal and frontoventral cirri in Urosomoida pattern, right frontoventral cirri form short row
in flat furrow at right body margin. Postoral cirri conspicuous because forming a straight or
slightly oblique row in body midline underneath adoral zone. Transverse cirrus at rear body
end, forms rather conspicuous tuft together with caudal cirri and last cirri of left marginal
row.
Adoral zone occupies about 20% of body length in vivo, while 26% in protargol preparations,
likely due to increased shrinkage of postoral body portion; composed of an average of 3
minute frontal and 14 ordinary ventral membranelles separated by a distinct gap at left
anterior corner of cell. Buccal field very narrow and flat, covered by an angularly projecting,
hyaline lip bearing paroral membrane. Paroral and endoral membrane staggering side by side,

one or two bristles close to right caudal cirrus, one to three anterior bristles more or less
distinctly dislocated, seemingly forming third kinety along anterior portion of right marginal
row (see ontogenesis).

Ontogenesis: The genesis of the infraciliature basically occurs as in oxytrichid hypo-
trichs (for a review, see BERGER 1999). Accordingly, it will be described briefly, emphasizing
new, apomorphic features. Likewise, nuclear and cell division occur in the ordinary manner.
All parental cirri and dorsal bristles not involved in anlagen formation are resorbed in late
dividers and post-dividers. The parental buccal field and undulating membranes are com-
pletely reorganized, while the adoral zone is only partially renewed, that is, the short
(leftmost) ciliary row of the membranelles disappears for a short period in late dividers (Fig.
Division commences with the formation of an oral primordium along the postoral cirral row,
which is soon incorporated into the growing, obtriangular primordium, producing adoral
membranelles very early (Fig. 167b, c). Some scattered dikinetids remain at the anterior
margin of the growing membranellar ribbon and organize to long cirral streaks (primary
primordia) extending into the parental frontarfield. Concomitantly, cirrus Hi/2 and the buccal
cirrus modify to anlagen proliferating basal bodies posteriorly; eventually, streak III/2
touches opisthe's anläge III. Thus, three long cirral anlagen streaks, so-called primary
primordia, are recognizable in early dividers (Fig. 167c, d; 398h). Next the primary primordia
divide transversely, providing each proter and opisthe with three anlagen (Fig. 167e). Five
cirral anlagen streaks are recognizable in early-middle dividers (Fig. 167e, f; 398i). The proter
anlagen originate as follows: anläge I is produced by the reorganizing undulating membranes;
anläge II originates from the buccal cirrus; anläge III from cirrus III/2 and opisthe anläge III;
and the anlagen IV and V originate from primary primordia generated by the opisthe. All
opisthe anlagen originate from the oral primordium, which incorporates the postoral cirral
row.

contour, newly formed shaded black, e, f: An early-middle and middle divider showing that the parental undulating
membranes disorganize and form cirral anläge I (arrow). The three primary primordia (cp. figure 167d) split transversely.
Thus, five cirral anlagen streaks (I-IV) are now recognizable both in proter and opisthe; in contrast, most oxytrichids have
six streaks (BERGER 1999), but see several other oxytrichid genera described in this book, which also have only five anlagen
streaks. Arrowheads mark marginal anlagen, which develop as is usual, g: A middle-late divider showing cirral segregation
within the anlagen as well as beginning migration of the single transverse cirrus and anläge IV, which will form the postoral
cirral row. The oral structures of the opisthe are almost finished. Note that the gap between frontal and ventral adoral
membranelies disappeared (arrowhead). PO - migrating postoral cirral row (= anläge IV), TC - migrating transverse cirrus.
Scale bars 30 um.
Cirral segregation occurs in middle dividers and usually produces some supernumerary cirri,
which are later resorbed, as in most oxytrichids. Cirral migration commences in middle-late
dividers, while the final positioning occurs in early and late post-dividers. The entire anläge
IV migrates to the buccal vertex, where it becomes the "postoral cirral row", while the last
cirrus (rarely the last two cirri) of anläge V migrates to the rear to become the transverse
cirrus (Fig. 167g-m).
Dorsal ontogenesis commences when the long primary primordia has been formed, that is, in
early dividers. The anterior bristle of row 1 produces an anläge in the proter. The second,
third, and likely the forth bristle of row 2 generate an anläge each in proter and opisthe (Fig.

kinety 1 consists of two bristles only, one in anterior body half and another close to the left caudal cirrus. Dorsal kinety 2 is
composed of an average of seven bristles, of which one to three anterior bristles are more or less distinctly dislocated to the
right, seemingly forming a third dorsal kinety along the anterior portion of the right marginal row (arrow); see also figures
166d, f. o, p: Early dividers showing that the anterior bristle of row 1 forms an anläge (arrow), while two anlagen are
generated in kinety 2 (arrowheads), one for the proter and another for the opisthe. q: A middle divider showing that the new
opisthe kinety 1 is generated by fragmentation and migration to the left of the anläge in kinety 2 (arrow). This unique mode
is the main generic feature. The macronuclear nodules fuse and the micronucleus commences division. CC - caudal cirri,
LMR - left marginal row, MA - macronucleus, MI - micronucleus, RMR - right marginal row.
While growing, the posterior portion of the opisthe anläge splits off and migrates left to
become dorsal kinety 1 of the opisthe, an extraordinary process and the main generic feature.
Thus, two dorsal anlagen each in proter and opisthe are recognizable in middle dividers (Fig.
167q, r). In late and very late dividers, when a caudal cirrus each has been formed at the
posterior end of the anlagen and cell furrowing is in progress, one to three bristles at the
anterior end of row 2 migrate more or less distinctly rightward (or are possibly displaced by
cell shaping), producing a third row of dorsal bristles in the right anterior quadrant of the cell.
We carefully checked that this row does not originate dorsomarginally, as in many
oxytrichids; actually, it is the anterior part of row 2, as evident from bristle counts in
interphase specimens and proter dividers (Fig. 167s-v; Table 147).

Occurrence and ecology: Rare at site (61), that is, in a highly saline soil from the
margin of the Etosha Pan. Fortunately, an abundant population developed in a sample
collected in 2001 in the area where the Unjab river crosses the main road to the village of
Terrace Bay, about 150 m NE of the road. Here, the river bed is a swampy area grown with
grasses, Cyperus, Phragmites, and shrubs. Up to 1 m high sand hills accumulate around the
grass Odyssea paucinervis (brakweed). The sample was taken from such a sand hill, which
contained so much organic debris that the sand was dark in colour. In the laboratory, no
ciliates developed within three days because the sample had a salinity of 180%o. Thus, we
washed it three times with tap water, decreasing salinity to 150%o. After a few days, Apouro-
somoida halophila appeared and reproduced rapidly. With time, the ciliate could be adapted
to ordinary sea water (35%o), but did not grow as well as between 100%o and 150%o, indicat-
ing that it prefers very high salinities.
Comparison with related species: Apourosomoida halophila has a clear identity
due to the postoral cirral row. There are only two species with the same feature, viz.,
Cladotricha variabilis RUINEN, 1938 and Uroleptus natronophilus DIETZ, 1965. The
specimen shown by RUINEN in figure 8c (here reproduced as Fig. 166j) highly resembles A.
halophila, but lacks the single transverse cirrus so typical for that species. However, RUINEN
might have mixed transverse and caudal cirri (Fig. 166j, k). On the other hand, BORROR &
EVANS (1979), who reinvestigated a very similar species, confirmed the absence of transverse
cirri by ontogenetic data (Fig. 166n, o). Later, this was sustained by an ontogerietic study of
Cladotricha halophila WiLBERT, 1995. Thus, the Namibian population cannot be conspecific
with the Australian C. variabilis. Furthermore, RUINEN (1938) likely mixed at least two
species, as indicated by the different nuclear and postoral cirral pattern (Fig. 166g-m). We fix
the unnumbered, leftmost specimen shown in RUINEN'S figure 8 as type of Cladotricha
variabilis (here reproduced as Fig. 166g). It differs from Apourosomoida halophila by the
number of macronuclear nodules (four vs. two) and a second, short row of postoral cirri.
Cladotricha variabilis redescribed by BORROR & EVANS (1979) from New Hampshire, USA,
has only two macronuclear nodules and many more frontoventral cirri, suggesting that it is
another, new species (Fig. 166o, p).
Uroleptus natronophilus DlETZ, 1965 has a similar cirral pattern as A. halophila, but is only
35-50 x 9-11 urn in size and has a conspicuous, sail-like undulating membrane. Further, the
macronuclear nodules are small and close together in the left anterior half of the cell. Likely,
it lacks a buccal cirrus.
Urosomoida reticulata nov. spec. (Fig. 168a-e, i-1; 381m-o; Tables 148, 149)
Diagnosis: Size about 140 x 40 urn in vivo; elongate ellipsoidal to oblanceolate. 2
macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus each. On average 37 adoral membranelies, 29
right marginal cirri, 25 left marginal cirri, 3 postoral cirri, 3 pretransverse and transverse cirri,
and 2 caudal cirri. Buccal cavity deep and of usual width; paroral commences close to left
frontal cirrus.
771

Type location: Litter of Combretum imberbe (leadwood tree) at foot of the Brandberg,
an island mountain at the east margin of the central Namib Desert, Namibia, 21°S 14°35'E
(site 48 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun reticulum (small web), the suffix -at, and the
inflectional ending -a, referring to the web-like, cortical pattern usually present.
Description of type population: Three populations were studied, namely from
Namibian site (48; type population), from Costa Rica, and from Venezuela (only in vivo).
They agree very well in the main features so that conspecificity is beyond reasonable doubt.
However, data are kept separate and the diagnosis and description contain only the type
population because some features indicate that the South American populations might be a
distinct subspecies.
Size 110-200 x 35-60 urn in vivo, usually about 140 x 40 urn, average length:width ratio
3.4:1 both in vivo and in protargol preparations (Table 148), only slightly flattened dorso-
ventrally, ventral side flat, dorsal often distinctly vaulted in mid-body. Shape highly variable,
that is, elongate ellipsoidal to oblanceolate and sigmoidal due to the gradually narrowed and
curved posterior body portion; about 20% of specimens with prominent and about 40% with
moderately distinct furrow along dorsal kinety 4 (Fig. 168a-c); body acontractile but very
flexible. Macronuclear nodules in middle third of body left of midline, each nodule with small
to medium-sized nucleoli, and, on average, two micronuclei attached at various positions;
anterior nodule invariably shorter but wider than posterior (Table 148), usually ellipsoidal
(2:1); posterior nodule on average elongate ellipsoidal (3:1). Contractile vacuole slightly
above mid-body at left cell margin. Cortex with web-like pattern produced by many bright,
about 0.5 um-sized globules arranged in single, paired, or rarely triplicate short rows; web
nodes frequently contain an about 1 um-sized crystal sparkling under interference contrast
illumination. Larger, 2-4 um-sized crystals of ordinary shape scattered underneath cortex
and, more rarely, in cytoplasm (Fig. 168c; 381m-o). Globule and crystal pattern pronounced
only in cells from well-growing cultures, while almost lacking in young, just excysted
specimens. Cytoplasm colourless, often packed with fat globules 2—4 urn across and some
crystals as described above. Feeds on fungal spores (Fusarium), testate amoebae (Euglypha
sp.), and ciliates {Gonostomum sp.) digested in 15-40 urn sized vacuoles. Moves moderately
fast, sometimes jerkily on microscope slide and between soil particles, showing great
flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number rather constant, except for postoral cirri, which vary from two to
four (Fig. 168d; Table 148). Marginal cirri about 15 urn long in vivo, right row commences at
level of froritoventral cirri and terminates, like left row, at rear end, leaving blank small area
occupied by caudal cirri on dorsal side. Frontal cirri distinctly enlarged. Buccal cirrus on
average 5 urn (range 2-7 urn) behind anterior end of paroral. Frontoventral cirri in hook-
shaped pattern. Postoral cirri rather close to buccal vertex. Near posterior end usually one,
rarely two pretransverse cirri ahead of two slightly enlarged, about 23 urn long transverse
cirri.
Dorsal bristles 3^4 urn long in vivo, arranged in four rows, as in most congeners (Fig. 168e;
Table 148). Row 1 distinctly shortened anteriorly; rows 2 and 3 bipolar; row 4 extends beside
a distinct furrow and terminates near mid-body. Usually one about 23 urn long and thus
prominent caudal cirrus at end of dorsal kineties 1 and 2; rarely two cirri attached to kinety 1
and one to kinety 2.

Adoral zone occupies 26-38%, usually 33% of body length, composed of an average of 37
membranelies of ordinary shape and structure (Fig. 168a, d; Table 148); bases of largest
membranelles about 10 urn wide in vivo, in the largest specimens up to 15 urn. Buccal cavity
deep but rather narrow, anterior margin semicircular as in Cyrtohymena, right (buccal lip)
conspicuously curved bearing paroral in distinct slit and covering proximal portion of adoral
zone. Undulating membranes in Oxytricha pattern, that is, distinctly curved and optically
intersecting slightly behind buccal cirrus; paroral uniquely commencing close to left frontal
cirrus, likely composed of zigzagging, about 10 urn long cilia; endoral cilia about 15 urn
long. Pharyngeal fibres clearly recognizable in vivo and after protargol impregnation, extend
obliquely backwards.
Observations on other populations: We found Urosomoida reticulata also in
Costa Rica and Venezuela. A detailed morphometric analysis of the Costa Rican population
revealed some conspicuous differences to the type population, indicating subspecies status.
However, at the present state of knowledge it seems more appropriate to describe them as
populations (Fig. 1681—1; Table 148): Size 110-150 x 25-45 urn, usually around 130 x 35 urn
in vivo; no reticulate cortical pattern, but this feature was probably not recognized or weakly
developed, as described in the Venezuelan population; on average two micronuclei, usually
one attached to each macronuclear nodule in various positions. Feeds on bacteria up to 15 jam
long and heterotrophic flagellates. Number of buccal cirri, frontoventral, and postoral cirri
rather variable. Buccal cirrus on average 2 urn (range 0-6 urn) behind anterior end of paroral;
a quarter of the specimens analyzed has a second buccal cirrus at 13% of body length. Dorsal
kinety 2 distinctly shortened anteriorly, kinety 4 terminates at 37% of body length on average.
Adoral zone of membranelles occupies 22-36%, on average 29% of body length, bases of
largest membranelles about 7 urn wide in vivo.
Venezuelan population (only data from life): Size 135 x 45 urn (n = 8, range 120-160 x 35-
60 urn); specimens analyzed three days after rewetting the sample without reticular cortical
pattern; however, after a week, when many specimens were present, all had the same cortical
pattern as described in the type population. Also in the Venezuelan specimens it is highly
conspicuous that the paroral almost touches the first frontal cirrus.
Occurrence and ecology: In Africa as yet found only at type location, where it
became abundant three weeks after rewetting the sample. The Costa Rican population
occurred in a mud sample (pH 3.9) from the tanks of bromelias at the bank of the Rio
Sarapiqui, Selva Verde National Park, 10°28'N 84°W. The Venezuelan population was found
in a slightly saline (10 %o) soil taken near the coastal village of Choroni in the Henry Pittier
National Park. These data indicate that U. reticulata has a broad ecological range and an at
least Gondwanan distribution.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: This
oxytrichid ciliate is unusual because it has a reduced number of cirri, in spite of its consider-
able size and deep, CyrtohymenaAike buccal cavity. However, the hook-like arranged
frontoventral cirri, the reduced number of pretransverse, transverse (three instead of seven)
and caudal cirri (two instead of three), the four dorsal kineties, and the undulating membranes
in Oxytricha pattern classify it unequivocally in Urosomoida HEMBERGER in FOISSNER, 1982.
However, the most outstanding feature of U. reticulata is the paroral membrane which
extends almost to the left frontal cirrus (Fig. 168d, k), similarly as in Tachysoma pellionellum
sensu PÄTSCH (1974; possibly a preparation artifact) and the quadrinucleate Urosomoida
775

dorsiincisura FOISSNER, 1982 (Fig. 168f-h). The latter species has not only this feature in
common with U. reticulata, but also the reticular cortical pattern (Fig. 168c, h) and, only with
the Namibian population, the specific dorsal infraciliature (Fig. 168e, g): both have an
anteriorly unshortened dorsal kinety 2, a long (about 50% of body length) kinety 4, and a
rather high number of bristles within each row. By contrast, the dorsal ciliary pattern of the
Costa Rican specimens agrees with that of Urosomoida agiliformis FOISSNER, 1982 (cp.
figure 168 1 with figures 168n, p) in that kinety 2 is distinctly shortened anteriorly, kinety 4 is
rather short (< 40% of body length), and the bristles within each row are widely spaced.
However, Urosomoida agiliformis differs from all populations of U. reticulata in size (length
below 100 urn vs. above 100 urn), distance between left frontal cirrus and paroral (large vs.
small), shape of buccal cavity (flat vs. Cyrtohymena-Mke), location of buccal cirrus (at
anterior end of paroral vs. distinctly behind), and some main morphometrics (Table 149). In
vivo, Urosomoida reticulata is easily confused with certain Oxytricha, Notohymena, and
Cyrtohymena species (usually five transverse and two pretransverse cirri; for a review, see
BERGER 1999).
We exclude that the Namibian population is composed mainly of macrostome individuals of
Urosomoida spp. because the relative length of the adoral zone of membranelies (33%) is
very near to that found in U. dorsiincisura (31%) and of flexible oxytrichids in general (<
40%). In vivo, Urosomoida reticulata is recognizable by the considerable size (> 100 urn),
the Cyrtohymena-\ike buccal cavity, the paroral membrane extending to the first frontal
cirrus, the reduced number of pretransverse and transverse cirri, the two macronuclear
nodules, and the reticulate cortical crystal pattern.

dorsiincisura from FOISSNER (1982).
Urosomoida namibiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 169a, b; Table 150)
Diagnosis: Size about 115 x 35 urn in vivo; outline elongate elliptical. 4 macronuclear
nodules in series. Cortical granules in longitudinal rows, ellipsoidal (1.5 x 0.8 urn), colour-
less. On average 22 adoral membranelles, 26 cirri each in right and left marginal row, 1
buccal cirrus, 3 postoral cirri, 3 transverse cirri, 3 caudal cirri, and 4 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm, Namibia,
20°10'S 15°25'E (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: The overall appearance, size, and the cortical granulation of this species are
very similar to the binucleate Oxytricha longigranulosa BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989a. Thus,
we refer to this species as concerns the in vivo aspect.
Size about 100-140 x 25-45 urn in vivo, length:width ratio on average 3.2:1 in protargol
preparations (Table 150). Centre of nuclear figure slightly ahead of body centre, left of
midline. Macronuclear nodules in series, rarely in fairly distinct pairs, ellipsoidal to globular,
with some large (3 urn) and small nucleoli. Most specimens with two or three slightly
ellipsoidal, compact micronuclei usually attached or close to first, third and fourth macro-
nuclear nodule. Cortical granules in closely spaced rows, individual granules colourless,
ellipsoidal (about 1.5 x 0.8 urn), do not impregnate with the protargol method used.
Cirral pattern constant, number of cirri rather variable (Fig. 169a; Table 150). Right marginal
row begins at level of first frontoventral cirrus and ends slightly subterminally, left row
usually ends in midline of rear end; bases of cirri in posterior body half often distinctly
smaller than those in anterior. Frontal cirri slightly enlarged, in usual pattern. Buccal cirrus
right of anterior end of paroral membrane. Frontoventral cirri in V-shaped pattern with left

cirrus (= cirrus III/2; arrow in Fig. 169a) slightly above level of last frontoterminal cirrus.
Usually three postoral cirri in series with first cirrus very near to oral vertex. Frequently three,
rarely two, four or five transverse cirri (including pretransverse cirri possibly present close to
transverse cirri) at rear end and thus distinctly projecting from body proper, about of same
size as most marginal cirri.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long, arranged in four rows (Fig. 169b; Table 150): row 1 begins
about at 20% of body length, composed of only eight bristles on average, distances between
individual bristles increase from anterior to posterior; row 2 also distinctly shortened
anteriorly, slightly sigmoidal, composed of 14 bristles on average; row 3 only slightly
shortened anteriorly, composed of 12 bristles on average; row 4 begins at about 9% and
terminates at 26% of body length, composed of only five bristles on average. Usually one
inconspicuous caudal cirrus each associated with bristle rows 1, 2 and 3.
Adoral zone occupies 19-30%, on average 25% of body length, composed of an average of
22 membranelles, of usual shape and structure (Fig. 169a; Table 150); bases of largest
membranelles about 6 urn wide in protargol preparations. Undulating membranes straight to
slightly curved, side by side, paroral 9 urn long, begins 2-3 urn ahead of 10 |im long endoral
at level of buccal cirrus; both membranes likely composed of dikinetids. Pharyngeal fibres
distinct after protargol impregnation, of ordinary length and structure.

' Of 25 specimens analyzed, two have only one postoral cirrus, and one has four.
f Including pretransverse ventral cirri possibly present close to transverse cirri.
g Specimens with five caudal cirri occur very rarely.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was fairly
rare.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: In the
absence of ontogenetic data, we classify this species in Urosomoida because it has only three
transverse cirri (including pretransverse cirri possibly present close to transverse cirri) and
four dorsal kineties. Oxytricha species usually have seven transverse cirri (including
pretransverse cirri) and five or six dorsal kineties (for a review, see BERGER 1999).
Urosomoida namibiensis differs from Urosomoida dorsiincisura FOISSNER, 1982 (Fig. 169c-
d), the sole quadrinucleate congener, by several features: distinct dorsal furrow absent vs.
present; cortical granules ellipsoidal (1.5 x 0.8 urn) and in longitudinal rows vs. 0.5 urn
783

across and in reticular pattern; undulating membranes rather short and almost straight vs.
rather long and curved; buccal cirrus at anterior end of paroral vs. behind; left frontoventral
cirrus (arrows in Fig. 169a, d) in front of level of rear frontoterminal cirrus vs. behind; on
average 22 vs. 32 adoral membranelles; three caudal cirri vs. usually two; lower number of
bristles in dorsal kineties 1-4, namely on average 8, 14, 12, 5 vs. 18, 26, 18, 14 (values from
type specimen; Fig. 169e). Oxytricha islandica BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989a, another
quadrinucleate species, lacks cortical granules and invariably has seven transverse cirri
including two pretransverse ventral cirri (Fig. 169f, g). In vivo, Urosomoida namibiensis is
characterized by the following combination of features: four macronuclear nodules; ellipsoi-
dal cortical granules in longitudinal rows; usually three transverse cirri.
Urosomoida monostyla nov. spec. (Fig. 170a-d; Table 151)
Diagnosis: Size about 45 x 12 urn in vivo; outline elongate elliptical. 2 ellipsoidal
macronuclear nodules with a single micronucleus in between. On average 15 adoral membra-
nelles, 14 cirri each in right and left marginal row, 1 postoral cirrus, 3 transverse and 2
pretransverse cirri, 2 caudal cirri, and 4 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, lookout site "Pan",
Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E (site 57 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of Greek adjective mono (single) and the Greek noun styla (rod ~
cirrus), referring to the single postoral cirrus, a main feature of this minute ciliate.
Description: Size 35-65 x 10-15 urn in vivo, usually about 45 x 12 urn, length:width
ratio on average 3.5:1 in protargol preparations (Table 151). Outline elongate elliptical or, in
the broader specimens, almost rectangular (Fig. 170a, b); dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1,
acontractile. Nuclear apparatus in body centre left of midline, invariably consists of two
ellipsoidal, almost abutting macronuclear nodules and a single, compact micronucleus in
between (Fig. 170a, d). Contractile vacuole near mid-body at left margin. Cortex flexible and
thin, without specific granules. Cytoplasm colourless, contains some small fat globules and
food vacuoles with remnants of bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates. Ontogenesis com-
mences with the formation of an oral primordium underneath the postoral cirrus.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 170a, c; Table 151). Cirri thick
compared to body size, marginal and frontoventral cirri 7-8 urn long, transverse and caudal
cirri about 12 urn. Right marginal row commences slightly above level of last frontoventral
cirrus and ends subterminally, left row extends to body midline posteriorly; distances between
individual marginal cirri increase slightly from anterior to posterior in both rows. Frontal cirri
about of same size as other cirri. Buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane.
Four frontoventral cirri, three of which forming conspicuous bow with frontal cirri. A single
postoral cirrus behind buccal vertex. Number and pattern of transverse and pretransverse cirri
very constant: transverse cirri close together, right of body midline near rear end and thus
distinctly projecting from body proper; pretransverse cirri between transverse cirri and last
cirrus of right marginal row.

Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long, arranged in four rows (Fig. 170d; Table 151): rows 1 and 2
commence subapically, row 1 composed of an average of only six bristles, distances between
individual bristles increase slightly from anterior to posterior; row 3 commences near anterior
end in body midline and ends subterminally at right margin of cell; row 4 consists of only two
to three bristles near left anterior body end. Invariably two conspicuous caudal cirri associated
with dorsal kineties 1 and 2, as shown by a late divider.
Adoral zone occupies 21-40%, on average 30% of body length, composed of an average of
15 membranelies of usual shape and structure; bases of largest membranelles about 3 urn
wide in protargol preparations (Fig. 170a, c; Table 151). Buccal cavity narrow and flat;
buccal lip angularly projecting, covers proximal portion of adoral zone and bears paroral
membrane. Undulating membranes slightly curved and staggering side by side, further details
not recognizable. Pharyngeal fibres distinct, of ordinary length and structure, extend
rightwards and then posteriorly (Fig. 170a, c; Table 151).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it developed in
a culture of artificial sea water, some crushed wheat grains, and a few millilitres of the
785

percolate from the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Abundance was low. Urosomoida
monostyla is well adapted to the soil habitat by its minute and flexible body.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: Possibly,
this species belongs to the genus -» Erimophrya, as indicated by the reduced number of
postoral cirri. However, in the absence of detailed ontogenetic data, we classify it conserva-
tively in the genus Urosomoida.
Urosomoida monostyla has a clear identity, making it easily recognizable both in vivo and
protargol preparations: small size (< 50 urn); only one postoral cirrus; and a reduced number

(3 vs. 5) of transverse cirri. There is only one congener with the same nuclear pattern, viz.,
Urosomoida perthensis, which has a size of 50-70 x 20-30 urn and the usual three oxy-
trichid postoral cirri (for a review of the genus, see BERGER 1999). Lamtostyla perisincirra
(HEMBERGER, 1985) BERGER & FOISSNER, 1988a, which has a similar size (50-90 x 20-30
urn) and the same nuclear pattern, lacks the postoral cirrus and the short dorsal kinety 4.
Inexperienced workers might confuse U. monostyla with several Oxytricha species, especially
O. elegans FOISSNER, 1999b, which occurs in the same geographic region and has the same
nuclear pattern. However, O. elegans is larger (70 x 25 vs. 45 x 12 urn in vivo), has five
transverse cirri (vs. three), and the cirri are extraordinarily long (17-25 urn vs. 7-12 (im) and
fine (Fig. 170e).
Urosomoida deserticola nov. spec. (Fig. 171a-d; Table 152)
Diagnosis: Size about 65 x 10 (im in vivo. 2 ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules with a
micronucleus each. Both marginal cirral rows anteriorly and posteriorly shortened by an
average of at least 15%. Transverse and caudal cirri form conspicuous tuft at posterior body
end. On average 13 adoral membranelles, about 10 right and left marginal cirri each, 2
postoral cirri, 3 transverse and 2 pretransverse cirri, 2 caudal cirri, and 4 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Dune soil (sand) in the Central Namib Escarpment, north of the village
of Solitaire, Namibia, 23°50'S 16°E (site 33 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Latin words deserta (desert) and colere (inhabiting),
referring to the habitat the species was discovered.
Description: Size 45-85 x 8-12 urn in vivo, usually near 65 x 10 urn, length:width ratio
4.6-6.7:1, on average 5.7:1 in protargol preparations (Table 152). Outline elongate fusiform
with both ends narrowly rounded, rarely elliptical (Fig. 171a, b); dorsoventrally flattened up
to 2:1, acontractile. Nuclear apparatus in middle body third left of midline, invariably consists
of two ellipsoidal, rather closely spaced macronuclear nodules each associated with an
ellipsoidal micronucleus at various positions. Contractile vacuole slightly above mid-body at
left margin. Cortex flexible, thin, without specific granules. Cytoplasm colourless, contains
some small fat globules and up to 8 um-sized food vacuoles with remnants of bacteria and
heterotrophic flagellates. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide. Ontogenesis commences
with the production of an oral primordium left of the postoral cirri.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability, pattern almost unique within genus
(Fig. 171a, b; Table 152). Cirri fine, consist of four (frontal, frontoventral, postoral, pretrans-
verse, and caudal cirri) to six (marginal and transverse cirri) cilia only. Marginal cirri about 8
urn long in vivo, form a row each at right and left ventral margin of cell, both rows distinctly
(> 15% on average; Table 152) shortened anteriorly and posteriorly, distances between
individual cirri increase from anterior to posterior in both rows. Frontal cirri not enlarged,
arranged in oblique row. Frontoventral cirri about 10 um long in vivo, form two short,
staggering rows each composed of two cirri right of buccal cavity; buccal cirrus at right
anterior end of paroral membrane, that is, far subapical. Postoral cirri in series close under-
neath buccal vertex, indicating that the third cirrus has been lost. Pretransverse, transverse,
787

and caudal cirri about 12 jam long in vivo, number and pattern very constant, form conspicu-
ous tuft at posterior body end: transverse cirri at left posterior margin of cell, pretransverse
cirri subterminal in body midline, caudal cirri at right posterior end of cell.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in four slightly oblique, sparsely ciliated
rows (Fig. 171c, d; Table 152). Rows 1 and 2 distinctly shortened anteriorly, that is, com-
mence at level of oral vertex; row 1 shortened also posteriorly, consists of three to four
bristles only. Row 3 slightly shortened anteriorly, where it commences in body midline, and

distinctly so posteriorly, where it ends at right margin of cell. Row 4 in right anterior corner
of cell, invariably consists of two bristles only. Two caudal cirri at right posterior margin of
cell associated with dorsal kineties 1 and 2, one bristle invariably close to upper caudal cirrus.

Adoral zone inconspicuous because occupying only 23-28%, on average 25% of body length,
composed of an average of 13 membranelles of usual shape and structure; bases of largest
membranelles about 3 urn wide in protargol preparations (Fig. 171a, b; Table 152). Buccal
cavity narrow and flat; buccal lip angularly projecting, covers proximal portion of adoral zone
and bears paroral membrane. Undulating membranes slightly curved and staggering side by
side frequently slightly overlapping in anterior third. Pharyngeal fibres of ordinary length and
structure.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, once more emphasiz-
ing the highly clumped distribution of ciliate species in the Namib Desert. Urosomoida
deserticola is well adapted to sand life by its slender, flexible, small body. Abundance was
moderate in the non-flooded Petri dish culture.
Generic assignment and comparison with related species: The generic
home of U. deserticola is uncertain because no appropriate dividers were found. The two
postoral cirri indicate that it could belong to —» Erimophrya.
Urosomoida deserticola has several outstanding features, especially the distinctly shortened
marginal rows and the tuft formed by the pretransverse, transverse, and caudal cirri at
posterior body end. There is only one congener with the same combination of features, viz.,
Urosomoida minima HEMBERGER, 1985 (Fig. 171e). However, this species, which was
discovered in garden soil near Bonn, Germany, has only three dorsal kineties, but possesses
six frontoventral, three postoral, and three caudal cirri. Furthermore, frontal and ventral adoral
membranelles are separated by a wide gap. Thus, these are distinct species.
The general appearance of U. deserticola is very near to other small members of the genera
—» Urosomoida, —» Erimophrya, and —» Oxytricha (for a review, see BERGER 1999). Thus,
identification should be checked by protargol impregnation.
Urosomoida agiliformis FOISSNER, 1982
This species is frequent in Namibia and in soils globally. The knowledge available was
reviewed by BERGER (1999). Several "typical" populations occur in Namibia. However, at
site (27) rather unusual specimens were discovered, casting doubts on, especially, the
taxonomic value of the number of postoral cirri, which is highly variable. Likewise, the
number of transverse and pretransverse cirri is between that of the Austrian type population
(3) and of classical Oxytricha species (7), namely 4 to 5. Possibly, the Namibian site (27)
population is a distinct subspecies, as indicated by the increased number of transverse and
pretransverse cirri.
Among 30 specimens investigated, 7 have only one postoral cirrus, 1 has two, and 22 have the
usual three; 6 have two transverse cirri and 24 have three; all have two pretransverse cirri.

Erimophrya nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Oxytrichidae with oral apparatus in Oxytricha pattern and V-like arranged
frontoventral cirri. Number of postoral and transverse cirri distinctly reduced. 1 right and 1
left row of marginal cirri. 3 or 4 dorsal kineties. Caudal cirri present. Ontogenesis in
Urosomoida pattern, but with only 5 fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen streaks.
Type species: Erimophryaglatzelinov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek nouns erimos (desert) and ophrya (eyebrow ~ cilia ~
ciliate), meaning a ciliate type occurring in deserts. Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera: This new genus is established for two Uro-
somoida-Wke hypotrichs as yet found only in the dunes of the Namib Desert. The genus is
founded with the arguments discussed under —> Hemiurosoma, that is, mainly based on the
reduced number (5 vs. 6) of fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen, a feature possibly caused
by the reduced number of transverse and postoral cirri. The general and especially the
frontoventral cirral pattern is quite similar to that of Urosomoida, from which this type of
hypotrichs likely evolved. Thus, it cannot be confused with Hemisincirra. Urosomoida
antarctica FOISSNER, 1996a also lacks one postoral cirrus, but has a full set of transverse cirri
and thus likely does not belong to Erimophrya. The generic home of —>• U. monostyla, which
lacks even two of the three postoral cirri, also requires ontogenetic data.
Erimophrya glatzeli nov. spec. (Fig. 172a-g; Table 153)
Diagnosis: Size about 110 x 25 urn in vivo; elongate elliptical. On average 2 widely
separated, elongate ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules, 21 adoral membranelles, 20 cirri each
in right and left marginal row, 2 postoral cirri, 1 transverse cirrus, 2 caudal cirri, and 4 dorsal
kineties.
Type location: Humous sand under Acacia erioloba in the Sossus Vlei of the Namib
Desert, 24°50'S 15°20'E (site 24 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Dedication: Wilhelm FOISSNER dedicates this new species to Prof. Dr. Gerhard GLATZEL,
famous forest ecologist at the University of Vienna, for his friendship over many years.
Description: Size 80-150 x 20-30 urn in vivo, usually near 110 x 25 urn, length:width
ratio highly variable, that is, 3.3-6.6:1, on average 4.7:1 both in vivo and protargol prepara-
tions (Table 153); flexible but acontractile, dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1 with rather
distinct furrow along dorsal kinety 4. Body outline usually very elongate elliptical with a
small concavity at oral vertex; posterior portion more distinctly narrowed than anterior,
occasionally with bluntly pointed end or rather broad, highly resembling —> Urosomoida
agiliformis (Fig. 172a-c, e-g). Macronuclear nodules in middle body third left of midline,
posterior nodule usually closer to body margin than anterior one, invariably connected by a
fine, granulated thread, broadly (1.5:1) to very elongate (5:1) ellipsoidal, on average 2.6:1 and
widely separated; nucleoli highly variable, often some large and many small ones. A globular

to ellipsoidal micronucleus each attached to left side of macronuclear nodules, about 2.5 urn
across and thus inconspicuous. Contractile vacuole slightly to distinctly above mid-body at
left cell margin. Cytopyge subterminal dorsal. No specific cortical granules. Cytoplasm
colourless, contains some lipid droplets and 5-15 um-sized food vacuoles with heterotrophic
flagellates and bacteria. Swims and glides rather rapidly.
Cirral pattern very constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 172a, b; Table 153).
Most cirri in vivo 10 um long, caudal cirri elongated to about 15 urn and obliquely spread.
Right marginal row commences at level of middle frontoventral cirrus and ends subtermi-
nally, while the left ends at level of transverse cirrus, that is, almost at posterior body end;
distances between individual cirri increase slightly from anterior to posterior in both right and
left row, while cirral size hardly changes. Frontal cirri slightly enlarged. Buccal cirrus right of
anterior end of paroral membrane. Invariably four frontoventral cirri in V-like pattern, three
of which form a conspicuous bow with the frontal cirri. Usually two, rarely one or three
postoral cirri distinctly behind buccal vertex, indicating that the first of the three cirri has
been reduced. Usually one, rarely two transverse cirri between last cirrus of marginal rows,
that is, in body midline near posterior end, producing seemingly confluent marginal cirral
rows.
Dorsal bristles 3-4 urn long in vivo, arranged in four rows forming very constant pattern (Fig.
172c, g; Table 153). Rows 1 and 2 slightly shortened anteriorly, each composed of about 10
bristles and associated with a caudal cirrus; row 3 slightly shortened anteriorly, extends to
rear body end, convex, leaving blank a fusiform field in body midline because row 2 is
concave; row 4 originates dorsomarginally and is composed of only three to six bristles
extending along a rather distinct furrow in anterior quarter of cell.
Adoral zone occupies 18-30%, on average 22% of body length, of usual shape and structure,
consists of an average of 20 membranelles; bases of largest membranelles about 6 urn wide in
vivo. Buccal cavity narrow and flat; buccal lip angularly projecting and thus prominent,
covers posterior portion of adoral zone of membranelles and bears paroral membrane. Both
undulating membranes curved and almost side by side, optically intersecting slightly in
anterior quarter; paroral commences a few micrometers ahead of endoral, which is longer
posteriorly, likely consists of closely spaced dikinetids. Pharyngeal fibres distinct in vivo and
protargol preparations, extend to at least mid-body right of midline (Fig. 172a, b; Table 153).
Ontogenesis not studied in detail, commences with the formation of an anarchic field of basal
bodies each left of the posterior postoral cirrus and the single transverse cirrus, quite similarly
to Urosomoida agiliformis (for a review, see BERGER 1999). Proter and opisthe cirral anlagen
streaks develop independently and produce supernumerary cirri that are reduced during cirral
patterning, indicating that the Erimophrya pattern is apomorphic. Four middle dividers
invariably show that only five cirral anlagen streaks develop (Fig. 172d), that is, one less than
in most oxytrichids (BERGER 1999).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location and surroundings, where it
occurred in great numbers, indicating that many cysts were present.
Comparison with related species: Erimophrya glatzeli differs from —> E.
arenicola by body shape (elongate elliptical vs. distinctly narrowed posteriorly), nuclear
pattern (macronuclear nodules widely separated and connected by a thread-like structure vs.
almost abutting and not connected), the number of postoral cirri (two vs. one), the dorsal
793

infraciliature (four vs. three rows and row 1 complete vs. distinctly reduced), and ontogenesis
(E. arenicola lacks the anarchic field of basal bodies left of the transverse cirrus). Thus, both
species are very distinct and easily distinguished even in vivo.
However, in vivo E. glatzeli is easily confused with several medium-sized hypotrichs,
especially Urosomoida agiliformis. Thus, check the number of postoral cirri (two vs. three),
which are easily recognized.

Erimophrya arenicola nov. spec. (Fig. 173a-h; Table 153)
Diagnosis: Size about 90 x 13 urn in vivo; pisciform and slightly twisted about main
body axis. On average 2 almost abutting, very elongate ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules, 15
adoral membranelies, 19 cirri each in right and left marginal row, 1 postoral cirrus, 1
transverse cirrus, 2 caudal cirri, and 3 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Sand with litter from Nara scrubs in the Sossus Vlei of the Namib
Desert, 24°50'S 15°20'E (site 23 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin arenicola (living in the sand) refers to the habitat the species was
discovered.
Description: Size 70-110 x 10-20 um in vivo, length.width ratio about 7:1 on average
both in vivo and after protargol impregnation (Table 153); flexible but acontractile. Shape
fairly constant, usually slenderly fusiform or pisciform, that is, anterior end narrowly rounded
and posterior tail-like elongated (Fig. 173a, b, d-f); occasionally elongate ellipsoidal with
both ends rounded or posterior end bluntly pointed (Fig. 173c); usually slightly twisted about
main body axis and inconspicuously flattened dorsoventrally. Macronuclear nodules in
middle body third left of midline, ellipsoidal (2:1) to very elongate ellipsoidal (4.5:1), on
average 4:1 and close together; with many minute nucleoli. On average two ellipsoidal
micronuclei, one attached to each macronuclear nodule in variable positions. Contractile
vacuole slightly to distinctly above mid-body at left cell margin. No specific cortical granules.
Cytoplasm colourless, with few to many lipid droplets 1-3 urn across and some ordinary
cytoplasmic crystals mainly in posterior body portion, which may thus appear dark under low
magnification. Feeds on the flagellate Polytomella and bacteria. Moves rather slowly and
clumsily, possibly due to the tortuous body.
Cirral pattern rather constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 173a, e, f; Table 153).
Most cirri about 8 urn long in vivo and rather fine; transverse cirrus and caudal cirri about 12
urn long. Right marginal row begins near level of last frontoventral cirrus, left extends onto
dorsolateral surface posteriorly due to the body torsion; distances between individual
marginal cirri increase distinctly from anterior to posterior in both right and left row. Frontal
796

cirri about same size as other cirri. Buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane.
Usually four frontoventral cirri, uppermost cirrus in, or almost in, line with frontal cirri. A
single postoral cirrus behind the buccal vertex. Number of transverse cirri not recognizable in
morphostatic specimens; ontogenesis shows that only a single transverse cirrus is formed
(Fig. 173g, h); thus, one of the three cirri usually present at posterior end is a transverse cirrus
(Fig. 173e, f; arrows).
Dorsal bristles about 2 urn long in vivo, arranged in three rows (Fig. 173f; Table 153): row 1
composed of 2-7 bristles only, one bristle invariably near corresponding caudal cirrus; row 2
slightly shortened anteriorly and also terminating with a caudal cirrus; row 3 originates
dorsomarginally and is composed of only two to four bristles extending in anterior quarter of
cell.
Adoral zone occupies 18-25%, on average 21% of body length, of usual shape and structure,
consists of an average of 15 membranelles; bases of largest membranelles 6 urn wide in vivo;
frontal three membranelles usually separated from ventral membranelles by a more or less
distinct gap at left anterior body corner. Buccal cavity narrow and flat; buccal lip angularly
projecting and thus prominent, covers posterior third of adoral zone of membranelles and
bears paroral membrane. Both undulating membranes slightly curved and almost in parallel,
endoral about 7-10 urn long, paroral 5-6 urn long, begins about 2 urn in front of endoral at
level of buccal cirrus; exact structure of membranes not clearly recognizable. Pharyngeal
fibres distinct in vivo and after protargol impregnation, of ordinary length and structure,
extend obliquely backwards (Fig. 173a, e; Table 153).
Ontogenesis was not studied in detail, but is very similar to that of Urosomoida (for a review,
see BERGER 1999). It commences with the formation of an oral primordium left of the single
postoral cirrus. Then five cirral anlagen streaks each develop independently in proter and
opisthe, that is, no primary primordia, as in —> Apourosomoida, are generated. Anlage IV
produces the single postoral cirrus, while anläge V generates the transverse cirrus (Fig. 173g,
h). Two dorsal anlagen each are generated in proter and opisthe and produce a caudal cirrus
each; the short kinety 3 originates dorsomarginally.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, that is, the Namib
Desert. Great numbers developed in the non-flooded Petri dish culture, indicating that many
resting cysts were present. With its slender body, Erimophrya arenicola is perfectly adapted
to the sandy biotope, like Circinella arenicola FoiSSNER, 1994a, a very large (about 400 x 22
jam), vermiform species discovered in an inland sand dune of Utah, USA.
Comparison with related species: For distinguishing Erimophrya arenicola and
—> E. glatzeli, see that species. The most important features are the number of postoral cirri
(one vs. two) and dorsal bristle rows (three vs. four). In vivo, E. arenicola is easily confused
with Urosomoida agilis (three postoral cirri and yellow cortical granules) and ->
Hemiurosoma similis (FOISSNER, 1982), which, however, entirely lacks postoral cirri (Fig.
183k). In vivo, E. arenicola is identified by the following combination of features: very
slender (7:1), two almost abutting macronuclear nodules, single postoral cirrus. Nevertheless,
identifications should be checked by protargol impregnation.

Gonostomum algicola GELLERT, 1942 (Fig. 174a-t, w, 175a-t; 399a-g; Tables
154,155)
Neotype material: Neotypified from Namibian site (62) population, according to
reasons 1, 3, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Synonymy: FOISSNER (1998a) synonymized Trachelostyla canadensis BUITKAMP &
WILBERT, 1974 with Gonostomum algicola, but considered the latter, like BERGER (1999),
BUITKAMP (1977b) and HEMBERGER (1982), as a synonym of G. affine.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 80 x 22 urn in vivo; lanceolate. 2 macronuclear
nodules. Cortical granules colourless and loosely spaced. Cirri conspicuously fine, most
comprising only 4 cilia. On average 18 right marginal, 13 left marginal, 2 frontoterminal, 5
frontoventral, and 3 caudal cirri; 1 buccal cirrus slightly above paroral and 1 transverse cirrus
near posterior end. Adoral zone of membranelles about one third of body length, composed of
20 membranelles on average. 3-6, usually 4 paroral kinetids.
Redescription: Size 60-110 x 15-30 jam in vivo, as calculated from measurements of
live specimens and values shown in table 154, assuming a shrinkage of 10-20% due to the
preparation procedures; length:width ratio also highly variable (2.6-5.9:1), usually 3.9:1 both
in vivo and after protargol impregnation; very flexible but acontractile. Overall shape usually
lanceolate, that is, distinctly tapering anteriorly and posteriorly, left margin almost straight,
dorsal convex and with distinct furrow along anterior portion of right marginal row, which
extends onto dorsal side; rarely elongate ellipsoidal or sigmoidal with bluntly pointed left
anterior end (Fig. 174a, k, 1-n); dorsoventrally flattened up to 1.5:1. Macronuclear nodules
usually slightly diagonal in central body third, that is, anterior nodule in midline, posterior left
of midline; elongate ellipsoidal, contain numerous globular nucleoli. Micronuclei near or
attached to macronuclear beads, globular, rarely ellipsoidal. Contractile vacuole with two
collecting canals extending anteriorly and posteriorly slightly above mid-body at left margin.
Cortical granules 0.8 x 0.5 urn in vivo, although highly refractive difficult to recognize
because colourless and loosely spaced in longitudinal rows (Fig. 174p), stain red with methyl
green-pyronin; tightly underneath cortex ellipsoidal structures, possibly mitochondria (Fig.
174o). Cytoplasm without crystalline inclusions, with some colourless fat globules 2-3 urn
across and about 5 um-sized food vacuoles containing residues of bacteria and their spores.
Movement rather rapidly, without peculiarities.
Cirral pattern very constant, cirral number of usual variability. Cirri conspicuously fine
compared to congeners because composed of only 2-8, usually 4 basal bodies (Fig. 174b, c,
q, r; 399a-e; Table 154). Marginal cirri about 10 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows
almost confluent posteriorly, gap occupied by transverse cirrus and caudal cirri; right row
slightly shorter than left, extends onto dorsal side anteriorly. Eleven fronto-ventral-transverse
cirri on average. Frontal cirri about 12 urn long in vivo, not distinctly enlarged, except
slightly posteriorly dislocated cirrus I/I, which invariably consists of two fairly long ciliary
rows. Buccal cirrus slightly right of and above paroral membrane. Frontoventral cirri in three
short, staggered rows close together, thus forming a rather irregular pattern or line usually
slightly shorter than, occasionally as long as adoral zone of membranelles. Frontoterminal
cirri near or on right dorsolateral surface, form short, slightly oblique row. Transverse cirrus
at or slightly right of midline near posterior end.

Dorsal bristles about 3 um long in vivo, arranged in three rows (Fig. 174c, r). Row 1 extends
along left cell margin, commences subapically at level of paroral membrane; row 2 extends in
double curved line from left subapical end to midline (or right) of posterior end; row 3 curves
from midline of anterior end to right posterior end. Caudal cirri about 15 urn long in vivo, one
each attached to dorsal ciliary rows, right cirrus often on lateral surface near last marginal
cirrus. Posterior marginal cirri, caudal cirri and transverse cirrus difficult to distinguish
because of similar size and close together on narrowed body end (see ontogenesis).
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (Fig. 174a, b, q, v; Table 154). Adoral zone of
membranelies occupies only about 37% of body length (50% in congeners), commences near
midline of anterior body end and extends straight along left body margin, performing abrupt
right bend and slight clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal cavity near left body margin.
Largest membraneile bases 4-5 um wide, membranelle structure depends on zone region
(Fig. 174d-g): buccal membranelles composed of two long rows of basal bodies with, except
Table 154. Morphometric data on Gonostomum algicola.

for last membraneile, two short rows of unequal length attached at right anterior end;
membranelles in middle portion of zone consist of two long rows of basal bodies with two
very short rows, each composed of two basal bodies, attached; frontal membranelles very
likely composed of three to four fairly short rows of basal bodies. Proximal portion of adoral
zone of membranelles and buccal cavity covered with curved, about 5 urn wide cortical
process (lip). Buccal cavity narrow and flat, at right bordered by slightly curved endoral
membrane composed of closely spaced basal bodies; paroral slightly above and left of
endoral, consists of only three to six widely spaced, about 9 urn long cilia. Pharyngeal fibres
clearly recognizable only after protargol impregnation, extend obliquely backwards.
Ontogenesis (Fig. 174s, t, w, 175a—t; 399f, g; Table 155): Terminology and interpretation
of the anlagen follow figure 174u, that is, BERGER & FOISSNER (1997). Note that the cirral
primordia of the proter and opisthe develop as single streaks (primary primordia), which
separate (secondary primordia) only in middle dividers. Thus, a distinction between proter's
and opisthe's anlagen is impossible in early dividers, except for anläge 1, which develops
differently.
Stomatogenesis commences with the apokinetal proliferation of basal bodies underneath the
buccal vertex, where a cuneate anarchic field develops (Fig. 174s, t). The differentiation of
adoral membranelles commences at the left anterior end of the oral primordium (Fig. 175a).
Membranelle formation proceeds posteriad, while the anläge for the opisthe's paroral and
endoral separates as a streak of loosely arranged basal bodies at the right margin of the oral
primordium (Fig. 175e, f, g; 399f)- These basal bodies arrange to a straight line of dikinetids
distinctly separate from the forming adoral zone of membranelles, which curves leftward
(Fig. 175i, k; 399g). A rather wide buccal field is thus recognizable in this stage (Fig. 399k).
Later, when the shaping of the oral apparatus commences, the paroral and endoral incline and
move close to the posterior half of the adoral zone. Thus, the buccal field narrows. The
further differentiation of the paroral and endoral anläge occurs as follows (Fig. 175m; 399g):
the anterior portion of the dikinetidal line splits longitudinally, producing a long row of
closely spaced basal bodies (the new endoral) to the left and, to the right, a short row of
widely spaced basal bodies, the prospective paroral. Interestingly and typical for the
Gonostomum group, the paroral locates left of the endoral when the buccal cavity is shaped,
respectively, reorganized in the proter (Fig. 175g, i, o, q; BERGER & FOISSNER 1997).
Possibly, this is caused by the growing buccal lip, which takes along the paroral. In the proter,
both membranes reorganize after the formation of frontal cirrus I/I (Fig. 175k, m), while the
parental adoral zone of membranelles is retained; the pharyngeal fibres, however, disaggre-
gate in middle dividers and are rebuilt in post-dividers.
The fronto-ventral-transverse cirri originate as follows: when the anarchic field of the oral
primordium elongates, proter's anläge I originates at the anterior end of the paroral, and the
buccal cirrus disorganizes and proliferates basal bodies anteriorly and posteriorly; further-
more, the posteriormost cirrus of frontoventral row 1 (Fig. 174q) disorganizes and proliferates
basal bodies posteriorly, which become anläge III (Fig. 174t, w). Simultaneously, anläge VI is
formed de novo right of and at large distance from the frontoterminal cirri (Fig. 174w, 175a,
b). In the next series of events, basal bodies from the anterior end of the oral primordium
migrate anteriad and form two streaks right of the parental endoral (Fig. 175c, d): the left
streak, which becomes opisthe's anläge I, is slightly but clearly separate from anläge II, while
the right streak touches proter's anläge III. Subsequently, anlagen IV and V, which are generated

anlagen and adoral membranelles, which commence to
differentiate at the anterior end of the oral primordium.
Basal bodies from the anterior end of the oral primordium
migrate anteriad and organize to two streaks (arrowheads).
The left streak becomes opisthe's anläge I, the right (III1)
touches anläge III. In the specimen shown in Fig. 175a, we
cannot exclude that the right anläge (left arrowhead) did
not originate by migration of basal bodies from the oral
primordium, but from a cirrus because about 15% of the
specimens have a cirrus at this site. Note that anläge VI,
which originates de novo, is distinctly separate from the
oral primordium and the frontoterminal cirri, e: Anlagen

by the posteriormost cirrus of rows 2 and 3 (Fig. 174q, 175e; 399f), elongate anteriad,
probably incorporating the remaining frontoventral cirri (Fig. 175f, g). Thus, two short
(anlagen I and I', which later form the left frontal cirrus in each proter and opisthe) and five
long streaks (anlagen II-VI) are now recognizable in the proter frontal area. The long streaks
(the so-called primary primordia) then divide transversely to form a set of cirral anlagen
(secondary primordia) each for the proter and opisthe (Fig. 175i). Cirri segregate from
anterior to posterior and very likely originate in the following manner (Fig. 175k, o, q, s;
399g; Table 155): frontal cirrus I/I from anläge I; buccal and frontal cirrus II/l from anläge
II; frontal cirrus III/l and usually one frontoventral cirrus from anläge III; usually two
frontoventral cirri from anläge IV; one transverse cirrus and usually two frontoventral cirri
from anläge V; two or three frontoterminal cirri from anläge VI. We must emphasize that this

is generated by the oral primordium. The new frontal cirrus I/I, which is generated by the anlagen I and I1, assembles in the
proter, while it still consists of widely spaced dikinetids in the opisthe. Note that the parental paroral (arrow), which is left of
the endoral in morphostatic cells, moved to the right, very likely due to the flattening of the buccal cavity during the
reorganization of the parental oral apparatus (see also Fig. 175i). i, j: Ventral and dorsal view of same specimen. The five

pattern was deduced from stages like those shown in figures 175m, o and 399g. Accordingly, we
cannot exclude that some cirral migration has already occurred and the pattern is thus different.

adoral zone is complete. The new cirri arrange to the mature pattern, that is, the proter frontal cirrus 1/1 replaces the old one
and the posteriormost cirrus of anläge V migrates posteriad to become the transverse cirrus (arrowheads). However, we
cannot exclude that some cirral migration has already occurred and the pattern is thus different. The anterior third of the
prater's and opisthe's paroral and endoral anläge splits longitudinally: the left fork becomes the long endoral, while the right
becomes the minute paroral. EM - endoral membrane, FT - frontoterminal cirri, PM - paroral membrane, TC - transverse

Finally, the new cirri arrange to the mature pattern and replace the parental frontal and
frontoterminal cirri in the proter and the transverse cirrus in the opisthe (Fig. 175m, o, q;
399g); the distinct migration of the latter, from the frontal field to the posterior body end, is
highly remarkable (Fig. 175m, o, q, s; 399g). Proter's anläge VI never contacts the last fronto-
terminal cirrus (VI/2 or VI/3), only the newly formed frontoterminal cirri come rather close to
the old ones when they migrate anteriad (Fig. 175m, o, q, r).

due to the shaping of the opisthe's buccal cavity and lip, while that of the proter is still moving to the left (cp. figure 175m
with figure 175q). Caudal cirri were generated at the end of all dorsal ciliary rows (arrowheads). CC - parental caudal cirri,

The marginal rows, the dorsal kineties and the nuclear apparatus divide as in congeners (Fig.
175h-t; BERGER & FOISSNER 1997, HEMBERGER 1982, OLMO & TELLEZ 1997, SONG 1990a).
The three dorsal kineties form an anläge each in the proter and opisthe by intrakinetal
proliferation of basal bodies and usually generate caudal cirri in a very specific time se-
quence: middle dividers produce a caudal cirrus each in rows 1 and 3 of the opisthe (Fig.
175j, 1), late dividers generate a caudal cirrus in the middle row of the opisthe and in each row
of the proter (Fig. 175n, p). This pattern is not entirely constant, that is, occasionally very late
dividers produce caudal cirri only in rows 1 and 3 of the proter and in the middle row of the
opisthe, while the caudal cirrus of the proter's middle row only assembles in early post-
dividers (Fig. 175r, t).
Other temporal relationships are also somewhat variable. For instance, the macronuclear
nodules may fuse before or after the primary primordia have split (Fig. 175g-j) and anläge I
of the opisthe may develop at the beginning or after streak formation (Fig. 175a-f).

Ontogenetic comparison: Our study focused on the formation of the six fronto-
ventral-transverse cirral anlagen, especially anläge VI, because previous investigations differ
in this respect. It is important to note that an Australian population of G. strenuum, which we
investigated for comparison (data not shown), has virtually the same pattern as G. algicola.
Gonostomum affine, as described by HEMBERGER (1982): Anlage II is formed by the buccal
cirrus and the oral primordium; the anterior portion of anläge VI is formed de novo, while the
posterior half is generated by the oral primordium. In G. algicola and the Australian popula-
tion of G. strenuum, the whole anläge II is formed by the buccal cirrus and anläge VI
originates entirely de novo (Fig. 174w, 175a, b).
Gonostomum strenuum from China, as described by SONG (1990a): The anlagen streaks are
formed mainly by the oral primordium (Fig. 9 in SONG'S paper; showing a reorganizer in our
opinion!). In G. algicola and the Australian population of G. strenuum, the anlagen streaks
are formed by the frontoventral cirri (except for opisthe's streaks I and VI and possibly the
posterior portion of anläge III; Fig. 174w, 175a, e, f, g, i). Gonostomum strenuum from
Europe, as described by OLMO & TELLEZ (1997): anläge VI originates from the last fronto-
terminal cirrus. In G. algicola and the Australian population of G. strenuum, anläge VI
originates de novo (Fig. 174w, 175a, c).
Very recently, after the present text was written, EIGNER (1999) studied the ontogenesis of G.
kuehnelti and G. affine. Unfortunately, the text is rather confusing and difficult to read.
Furthermore, EIGNER (1999) hardly discussed previous results. Thus, a proper comparison is
difficult. However, it seems that his data match ours: anläge VI originates de novo, without
any participation of the parental frontoterminal cirri; proter's and opisthe's anläge I are not
connected in G. affine; and the primary primordia develop mainly from the frontoventral cirri,
not from the oral primordium, as stated by SONG (1990a). On the other hand, EIGNER (1999)
denies any reorganization of the parental undulating membranes in G. affine and possibly also
in G. kuehnelti. This is an incorrect statement because his figures 18 and 25 show the
reorganization in G. affine very clearly and are virtually identical to our figure 175m. Thus,
we also doubt that proter's and opisthe's anläge I are connected in G. kuehnelti.
Although some of the differences detailed in the previous paragraphs might be species-
specific, we suggest that all populations have the same pattern as G. algicola, that is, we
interpret most differences as observation errors.
Occurrence and ecology: Gonostomum algicola was discovered by GELLERT (1942)
in Hungary in the algal layer covering tree bark. Our record is the first from mineral soil and
the second world-wide; both habitats agree in being ephemeral. Also found at Namibian site
(50) with the same features.
Comparison with original description and related species: Our
specimens agree with Gonostomum algicola GELLERT, 1942 in several specific features (cp.
809

figures 174b, c with figures 174h, i): size (prepared specimens 52-95 |im respectively
60-100 urn), short adoral zone of membranelles (about 40% of body length; about 50% in
congeners), and pattern and number of frontoventral and frontoterminal cirri. There are,
however, some differences, namely, the number of transverse (1 vs. 4) and caudal cirri (3 vs.
2). Both are difficult to ascertain without ontogenetic data, even in protargol-impregnated
specimens, because all cirri have a very similar size and are close together due to the
narrowed body end. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that GELLERT, who studied only opal
blue-treated, air-dried, morphostatic specimens, misidentified the posteriormost marginal cirri
and the right caudal cirrus, which is often laterally inserted, as transverse cirri (cp. figures
174h, i with figures 174q, r); accordingly, he counted four ventral transverse and two dorsal
caudal cirri. Some other small differences, for instance, in the arrangement of the dorsal
kineties and the length of the right marginal row, are very likely also caused by GELLERT'S
insufficient preparation method.
Gonostomum algicola differs from the congeners so far investigated in detail (BERGER 1999,
BUITKAMP 1977b, BUITKAMP & WlLBERT 1974, EIGNER 1999, FOISSNER 1982, 1987b,
HEMBERGER 1982, OLMO & TELLEZ 1997, SONG 1990a) by the short adoral zone of membra-
nelles (37% vs. about 50% of body length), the slender body (4:1 vs. 2.6-3.4:1), the fine cirri
(4 vs. > 8 cilia), the low number of transverse cirri (1 vs. usually > 3), and the minute paroral
membrane (4 vs. > 10 cilia). The single transverse cirrus is probably the most useful feature
because it was found also in the population from site (50). The other differences occur also in
—>. G. namibiense, which is probably the most closely related species, but has a distinct tail
and thus cannot be mixed with G. algicola.
Gonostomum namibiense nov. spec. (Fig. 176a—j; Table 156)
Diagnosis: Size about 90 x 20 urn in vivo. Elongate lanceolate with tail-like posterior
portion occupying about 15% of body length. 2 macronuclear nodules. Cortical granules
about 1 x 0.3 urn, colourless, scattered. On average 26 right marginal, 17 left marginal, 2
frontoterminal, 6 frontoventral, 2 pretransverse, and 5 transverse cirri; 1 buccal cirrus in front
of anterior end of paroral. Adoral zone of membranelles about 37% of body length, composed
of 27 membranelles on average. 5-10, usually 6 paroral kinetids.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E
(site 61 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size 80-110 x 15-25 urn in vivo, usually near 90 x 20 urn. Body elongate
ellipsoidal or lanceolate, with short but distinct tail occupying about 15% of body length in
vivo (Fig. 176a, c, d; Table 156). Cells acontractile but flexible and very fragile, prepared
specimens thus considerably stouter (2.8-3.5:1, on average 3.1:1) and with broadened tail.
Trunk flattened up to 2:1 and asymmetrical, left margin straight to slightly sigmoidal, right
convex and narrowed in posterior quarter producing tail-like process. Anterior macronuclear
nodule about in, posterior slightly left of midline, ellipsoidal (2:1) to elongate ellipsoidal
(3:1), contain numerous globular nucleoli. Micronuclei near or attached to macronuclear
810

nodules, about 3 um across in vivo. Contractile vacuole with two collecting canals near mid-
body underneath buccal vertex. Cortical granules closely spaced, scattered, difficult to
recognize because minute (1 x 0.3 urn) and colourless, stain red with methyl green-pyronin
and increase to 2 x 1 urn (Fig. 176b, d); impregnate more or less intensely with protargol.
Cytoplasm colourless but opaque, with 1-3 um-sized crystals mainly in posterior body
portion, and food vacuoles 4-5 urn across containing bacterial residues. Glides slowly to
rather rapidly on microscope slide.
Cirral pattern rather constant and conspicuous because of midventral-like frontoventral cirral
pairs; number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 176e, f; Table 156). Most cirri about 10 urn
long. Marginal cirri in two rows, both extend onto tail and posterior end, where they become
cilia-like and are thus easily mistaken for dorsal bristles. Twelve frontoventral cirri on
average. Frontal cirri moderately enlarged. Buccal cirrus slightly right and in front of paroral
membrane. Frontoventral row usually distinctly shorter than adoral zone of membranelies,
slightly right of midline, composed of two to four, usually three cirral pairs and a single cirrus
at posterior end of row. Frontoterminal cirri near dorsolateral surface, form short, often
slightly oblique row. Transverse cirri subterminally in midline, form hook-like pattern,
slightly enlarged and about 15 urn long in vivo; pretransverse cirri very close to transverse
cirri.
Dorsal bristles 3—4 urn long in vivo, arranged in three rows (Fig. 176g, i). Row 1 extends,
except anteriorly, along left cell margin, commences, like row 2, subapically; row 3 com-
mences apically and extends along right cell margin. Possibly two fine caudal cirri at top of
tail; however, the arrangement and composition of the tail ciliature are difficult to analyze
because both (marginal? caudal?) cirri and dorsal bristles are composed of basal body pairs;
in vivo, the bristles (cirri) on the top of the tail are inconspicuous. Consequently, caudal cirri
were not included in the diagnosis.
Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (Fig. 176a, e, f). Adoral zone occupies only about 37%
of body length (50% in most congeners), composed of an average of 26 membranelies,
commences near midline of anterior body end and extends straight along left body margin,
performing abrupt right bend and slight clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal cavity near
left body margin. Largest membraneile bases about 5 urn wide. Proximal portion of adoral
zone and buccal cavity almost entirely covered by a curved, rather prominent cortical process
(buccal lip) bearing the paroral membrane, which consists of five to ten widely spaced, 10 urn
long cilia. Buccal cavity flat and narrow, at right bordered by slightly curved endoral
membrane composed of tightly spaced basal bodies. Pharyngeal fibres clearly recognizable in
vivo, extend obliquely backwards.

Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in
Namibia, where it occurs in non-saline to highly saline
habitats. However, the populations from sites (30) and (49)
might be distinct subspecies because of considerable differ-
ences in quite a number of morphometrics (Table 156). On
the other hand, body shape, cortical granules, and cirral
pattern are rather similar in all populations. Comparable
differences have been reported among Gonostomum affine
populations (BERGER 1999, FOISSNER et al. 2001). Very
recently, we found G. namibiense in a slightly saline soil
sample from Saudi Arabia. This indicates that it has a wide
geographical distribution and prefers saline habitats.
Comparison with related species: Gonostomum
namibiense differs from all congeners by the tail-like
elongation of the rear end, a very distinct feature facilitating
in vivo identification. However, we have three further tailed
species with similar extrusomes in our unpublished notes.
Thus, identification must be checked by protargol impreg-
nation. The tail is very likely produced by body elongation
because the usual 50% Gonostomum ratio of body length:
length of adoral zone of membranelles is obtained only when
the tail is omitted.

In vivo Gonostomum namibiense is easily confused with —»
Paragonostomum spp. These species lack transverse cirri and

Gonostomum strenuum (ENGELMANN, 1862) 1878 (Fig. 177a-d; Table 157)
STERKI,
Neotype material: Neotypified from Namibian site (49) population, according to
reasons 1, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size 80-130 x 25-55 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal. 2 macronuclear
nodules. Cortical granules colourless or yellowish, 1.0-1.5 x 0.6 |im in size, form indistinct
fringe. On average 20-27 right marginal, 15-17 left marginal, 4-5 frontoterminal, 10-12
frontoventral, and 4-5 pretransverse and transverse cirri; 1 buccal cirrus right of anterior half
of paroral; frontoventral cirral row V composed of 5-9 cirri, that is, long and surpassing
buccal vertex. Adoral zone about 50% of body length, composed of 28-29 membranelles on
average. Usually 10-13 paroral cilia.
Remarks:The Namibian specimens (Fig. 177a, b; Table 157) are highly similar to the
populations described by SONG (1990a) from China (Fig. 157c), by OLMO & TELLEZ (1997)
from Spain (Fig. 177d), and by FOISSNER et al. (2001) from Australia. Thus, data from all
populations were used for the improved diagnosis, and only some supplementary observations
are provided from the neotype population.

(usually 20-25 cirri). However, the four frontoterminal cirri indicate that it is nearer to G. strenuum than to G. affine, f:
Typical G. affine with 11 frontoventral cirri. Likely, the number of frontoterminal cirri (2 vs. 4-6) is the most important
character to distinguish G. affine from G. strenuum.

The four populations mentioned above can be clearly distinguished from a "typical"
Gonostomum affine (STEIN, 1859) STERKI, 1878 (Fig. 157f) by the following features: 3-6,
usually 4 frontoterminal cirri vs. usually 2; frontoventral row V long and composed of 5-9
cirri and thus usually surpassing buccal vertex vs. short usually composed of two cirri only
and thus terminating ahead of buccal vertex. In total, Gonostomum strenuum has distinctly
more frontoventral cirri (20-25) than G. affine (6-15, on average 11; data from 18 soil
populations summarized by FOISSNER 2000b). Furthermore, Gonostomum strenuum has
conspicuous cortical granules usually lacking or indistinct in G. affine. BERGER (1999, p. 369)
also used the end of the left marginal row as a key feature: it is behind the transverse cirri in
G. strenuum (Fig. 177c, d), while more or less left of the transverse cirri in G. affine (Fig.
177f). However, this feature is obviously not met by the Namibian specimens (Fig. 177a).
FOISSNER (2000b) described a Gonostomum population from Venezuela (Fig. 177e), which is
difficult to assign because the total number of frontoventral cirri (14-18, on average 16) and
the length of frontoventral row V are between the values mentioned above. The three to four
frontoterminal cirri indicate that it is more closely related to G. strenuum than to the G. affine
group (FOISSNER et al. 2001).
Additional observations from Namibian site (49) specimens (see table
157 for detailed morphometrics): Size about 80-110 * 25-35 urn in vivo. Flattened about 2:1
dorsoventrally. Contractile vacuole with longitudinal collecting canals. Cortical granules in
loose rows, form distinct fringe; individual granules ellipsoidal, about 1.0-1.2 x 0.6 urn,
yellowish, compact and thus bright, stain red with methyl green-pyronin but are not ejected,
do not impregnate with the protargol method used. Cytoplasm colourless, posterior cell
portion usually with many bright lipid droplets 2-3 urn across. Feeds on bacteria digested in
vacuoles 6-10 |im across. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide. Frontoventral, marginal
and caudal cirri about 15 urn, transverse cirri about 20 urn, and dorsal bristles about 3 urn
long in vivo. Adoral zone extends over 51% of body length on average, bases of largest
membranelles about 5 urn wide in vivo. Paroral cilia about 6 urn long in vivo.
Occurrence and ecology: ENGELMANN (1862) discovered Gonostomum strenuum in
a Lemna pond near Leipzig, Germany. Later, SONG (1990a) isolated it from a Chinese soil,
while OLMO & TELLEZ (1997) found it in moss from emergent river stones in Spain, and
FOISSNER et al. (2001) observed it in a soil sample from the Murray River floodplain in
Australia. In Namibia, G. strenuum occurred in mud and soil from road puddles at the
Bambatsi Guest Farm (site 49 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2), which is not a strictly edaphic
site. These data show that G. strenuum is a cosmopolitan occurring in both freshwater and
soil. See BERGER (1999) for a detailed review on distribution and ecology of G. strenuum.
Generally, the species is much rarer than the common G. affine.

Paragonostomum nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Oxytrichinae without transverse cirri. Adoral zone of membranelles,
undulating membranes, and ontogenesis in Gonostomum pattern. Posterior body portion more
or less distinctly tail-like. Frontoventral cirri and frontoterminal cirri in Y-like pattern or
single row. 1 right and left marginal row. 3 dorsal kineties.
Type species: Paragonostomum caudatum nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek para (beside) and the generic name Gonostomum,
meaning a ciliate related to Gonostomum. Neuter gender.
Comparison with related genera: Paragonostomum differs from —» Gonostomum
STERKI, 1878 by the lack of transverse cirri. Indeed, it is, beside -> Vermioxytricha, the first
oxytrichid without transverse cirri, although in some Gonostomum affine populations
specimens without transverse cirri occur, but, on average, all possess at least two transverse
cirri (BERGER 1999). All Paragonostomum species have a conspicuous tail, which is very
fragile and thus difficult to preserve. Furthermore, the tail cirri are minute, sometimes
consisting of two cilia only. Consequently, we could not ascertain unequivocally whether
caudal cirri are present or not. Thus, the tail ciliature illustrated is possibly not entirely
correct, and the feature, although important, not included in the species diagnoses. Detailed
ontogenetic data are required to interpret the tail ciliature correctly.
Paragonostomum includes four species which differ in the nuclear apparatus, the arrangement
of the frontoventral cirri, some morphometrics of the ciliature, and the structure of the paroral
which is, uniquely within the hypotrichs, bipartite in most species (Fig. 179e, f, 180e, f, i, j,
181c). Usually, we assign such a peculiarity genus weight (see reviews by BERGER &
FOISSNER 1997 and BERGER 1999). However, the feature is not entirely stable and thus
perhaps better used as a species character.
819

Cladotricha GAIEVSKAIA, 1925 also has a rather similar oral ciliature and lacks transverse
cirri. However, the type species, Cladotricha koltzowii GAIEVSKAIA, 1925, and some other
species have one or more frontoventral cirral rows extending to near posterior body end
(BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1988, BORROR & EVANS 1979, RUMEN 1938), whereas the
frontoventral row of Paragonostomum hardly extends beyond the buccal vertex (Fig. 178h, i,
1; 179e, f, 180c, e, 181c). Furthermore, there is an important ontogenetic difference:
Cladotricha koltzowii and C. variabilis differentiate the frontoventral ciliature independently
in the proter and opisthe (BORROR & EVANS 1979), while the GonostomumlParagonostomum
group produces primary primordia (see BERGER 1999 and —• Gonostomum algicola for
details). Thus, synonymy of Cladotricha and Paragonostomum is unlikely.
Paragonostomum caudatum nov. spec. (Fig. 178a—1; 381s, t; Table 158)
Diagnosis: Size about 85 * 20 urn in vivo. Lanceolate with conspicuous tail occupying
about 25% of body length. 2 macronuclear nodules. On average 19 right marginal, 11 left
marginal, and 4 frontoterminal cirri; frontoterminal and frontoventral cirral rows distinctly
separate, the latter composed of an average of 6 cirri and ending at 30% of body length; 1
buccal cirrus at anterior end of paroral composed of 7-12, usually 9 kinetids. Adoral zone of
membranelles about one third of body length, composed of 19 membranelies on average.
Type location: Soil from a meadow in the Botanical Garden of the town of Darwin,
Australia, 12°26'S 130°50'E.
Etymology: The Latin caudatum (having a tail) refers to the tail, a main feature of this
species.
Description: Size 70-110 * 15-25 urn in vivo, usually about 85 x 20 urn, length:width
ratio of trunk 3.0-4.6:1, on average 3.6:1 in protargol preparations. Body clavate due to
lanceolate to ellipsoidal trunk and cylindroidal tail occupying about 25% of body length in
vivo and protargol preparations (Fig. 178a, c-1; 381s, t; Table 158); highly fragile, especially
tail, and flexible, but acontractile. Trunk flattened up to 2:1 dorsoventrally and asymmetrical:
left margin straight to slightly convex, right distinctly convex and narrowed in posterior
quarter, producing conspicuous tail. Macronuclear nodules in middle third of trunk slightly
left of midline, ellipsoidal (2:1) to elongate ellipsoidal (4:1), contain numerous globular
nucleoli. Micronuclei near or attached to macronuclear nodules, about 3 x2 urn in vivo.
Contractile vacuole underneath buccal vertex. Cortical granules recognizable neither in vivo
nor in protargol and methyl green-pyronin (Saudi Arabian population) preparations. Cyto-
plasm colourless, with few, about 3 um-sized crystals and some lipid droplets 1-4 urn across.
Feeds on bacteria digested in vacuoles 4-5 urn in diameter. Glides rather rapidly on micro-
scope slide, often motionless for some time, tail occasionally adheres to soil particles with a
slimy thread (Fig. 178g).
Cirral pattern very constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 178h, i, k, 1; Table 158).
Marginal cirri about 8 um long in vivo, right row extends onto dorsal side anteriorly and
usually terminates at base of tail; left row distinctly shortened posteriorly, that is, usually
terminates above base of tail. Fourteen frontoventral cirri on average. Frontal cirri about
13 um long in vivo, moderately enlarged. Buccal cirrus slightly right and ahead of paroral
820

membrane. Frontoventral row usually slightly shorter, occasionally as long as adoral zone of
membranelles, right of midline, with anteriormost cirrus shifted slightly to left (arrow in Fig.
178h) and thus behind right frontal cirrus. Frontoterminal cirri near or on right dorsolateral
surface, form short row. Transverse cirri absent.
Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in three rows (Fig. 178j, k), of which two or
all extend onto tail. Row 1 commences near level of buccal cirrus and extends along left cell
margin; row 2 extends slightly left of midline from near anterior body end to posterior trunk
end; row 3 commences subapically and extends along right cell margin. Two or three
(caudal?) cirri at top of tail, conspicuous in vivo because about 20 urn long and usually
widely spread (Fig. 178a). Arrangement and composition of tail ciliature difficult to analyze
because the tail is only 1.0-2.5um wide (see genus introduction).

Oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern (Fig. 178a, b, h, i, k, 1; BERGER 1999). Adoral zone
occupies approximately 44% of trunk length, but only about one third of body length,
commences near midline of anterior body end and extends straight along left body margin,
performing abrupt right bend and slight clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal cavity near
left body margin; composed of an average of 19 membranelies, bases of largest membranelies
about 4 urn wide. Proximal portion of adoral zone and buccal cavity partially covered by a
curved, rather prominent cortical process (buccal lip) bearing the paroral membrane, which
consists of 7-12 widely spaced, at least 5 urn long cilia. Buccal cavity narrow and flat, at
right bordered by slightly curved endoral membrane composed of tightly spaced basal bodies.
Pharyngeal fibres clearly recognizable in vivo and after protargol impregnation, extend
obliquely backwards.

b In Paragonostomum caudatum, the distance from anterior body end to tail base was measured (arrow in Fig.
178i), while in P. binucleatum and P. multinucleatum total body length is given because the tail is too
indistinctly set off from body proper.
c Uncertain because difficult to recognize.
d PM1 - type population, PM2 - USA population.
e Erontoterminal cirri included.
f Specimens with four dorsal kineties occur rarely.
Occurrence and ecology: The type population was discovered in loamy soil (pH 7.1)
from a meadow with some shrubs and trees in the Botanical Garden of the town of Darwin,
Australia. Furthermore, we found Paragonostomum caudatum in fine, blackish soil (pH 5.3)
from the bank of the Rizzanes River near the town of Propriano, Corsica (collected by Dr.
Bruno GANNER in September 1985); in a soil sample from the USA; in mouldy, about 10 cm
thick, sandy Casuarina litter (pH 7.2) on a dam near the village of Safwa, Saudi Arabia; and
at several sites in Namibia (Table 4). Thus, P. caudatum is a common and very likely
cosmopolitan species preferring fine-grained mineral soils.
825

Comparison with related species: Paragonostomum caudatum is a conspicuous
species due to the distinct tail, which is very likely produced by body elongation because the
usual 50% Gonostomum ratio of body length:length of adoral zone of membranelles is
obtained only when the tail is omitted. It differs from -» P. multinucleatum by the number of
macronuclear nodules (2 versus 4-9) and the shape of the paroral (continuous versus
bipartite); and from —» G. namibiense, inter alia, by the lack of transverse cirri. —> Para-
gonostomum rarisetum has distinctly fewer frontoventral cirri, which uniquely form a single
short row with the frontoterminal cirri. —> Paragonostomum binucleatum has distinctly fewer
frontoventral cirri (5 vs. 10), a much less distinct tail, and a conspicuous gap in the paroral.
Paragonostomum binucleatum nov. spec. (Fig. 179a-g; 38lu; Table 158)
Diagnosis: Size about 70 x 23 urn in vivo. Pisciform with tail-like posterior portion
occupying about 10% of body length. 2 macronuclear nodules. On average 21 right marginal,
15 left marginal, 2 frontoterminal, and 3 frontoventral cirri; 1 buccal cirrus at anterior end of
paroral composed of 4-8, usually 6 kinetids divided into an anterior and posterior segment by
a small gap. Adoral zone of membranelles about 37% of body length, composed of 21
membranelles on average.
Type location: Artificial (?) soil from lawn of a hotel in the village of Sharm el Sheik,
Sinai, Egypt, 27°N 34°E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective binucleatum (two nuclei) refers to the two macronuclear
nodules, a main feature of this species.
Description and comparison with related species: This species is very
similar to -> P. multinucleatum, differing only by the number of macronuclear nodules,
namely two vs. seven. Thus, the reader is referred to the description of P. multinucleatum, and
the detailed figures and morphometrics of P. binucleatum (Fig. 179a-g; Table 158). The tail
is usually slightly longer in P. multinucleatum than in P. binucleatum (Fig. 38 lu). However, it
is rather variable and thus should not be used as a distinguishing feature. Like the other
members of the genus, Paragonostomum binucleatum is very fragile and thus usually more or
less inflated and distorted in ordinary protargol preparations (Fig. 179f, g).
-» Paragonostomum rarisetum, which has a similar size and the same nuclear pattern, has a
more distinct tail (25% vs. 10% of body length), and slightly more frontoventral and
frontoterminal cirri (7 vs. 5), but fewer adoral membranelles (15 on average vs. 21).
—» Gonostomum namibiense, which has also a similar size and shape and the same nuclear
pattern, possesses transverse cirri and cortical granules, which are, however, difficult to
recognize because they are minute (1 x 0.3 urn) and colourless. Likewise, -> Gonostomum
algicola is rather similar, but usually lacks any indication of a tail, has only four paroral
kinetids in a short, uninterrupted row, and possesses one transverse cirrus, which is, however,
difficult to recognize. Thus, reliable species identification requires protargol impregnation or
very careful in vivo observation.

Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type location, where it was moderately
abundant, and at Namibian sites (33, 49, 52, 56), where it was rare. The soil where P.
binucleatum was discovered, is very likely artificial (compost or composted activated sludge)
because it was only an about 5 cm thick layer above the sandy ground. It was black and "fat",
hardly contained any litter, had a pH of 8.2, and was sown with lawn grasses a few days
previously.
Paragonostomum multinucleatum nov. spec. (Fig. 180a-k; Table 158)
Diagnosis: Size about 75 x 15 urn in vivo. Pisciform with tail-like posterior portion
occupying about 20% of body length. On average 7 macronuclear nodules forming distinct
strand, 22 right marginal, 16 left marginal, 2 frontoterminal, and 3 frontoventral cirri; 1
buccal cirrus in front of paroral composed of 4-7, usually 6 kinetids divided into an anterior
and posterior segment by a small gap. Adoral zone of membranelies about one third of body
length, composed of 19 membranelies on average.
Type location: Highly saline crust soil from small quartz stones about 1 km inshore of
the Great Bay of the town of Lüderitz, Namibia, 26°40'S 15°10'E (site 11 in figure 2 and
chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective multinucleatum (many nuclei) refers to the numerous
macronuclear nodules, a main feature of this species.
Description: Size 60-90 * 13-25 urn in vivo, usually about 75 x 15 urn, length:width
ratio 3.0-4.5:1, on average 3.8:1 in protargol preparations, where specimens are more or less
inflated since they are rather fragil (Table 158). Body elongate and tail-like posteriorly in
vivo and protargol preparations; only slightly flattened and asymmetrical, left margin straight
to slightly sigmoidal, right slightly to distinctly convex and narrowed in posterior quarter
producing tail-like elongation; acontractile but very flexible (Fig. 180a-c). Macronuclear
nodules mainly left of midline in series, sometimes in C-shaped pattern, some nodules
occasionally separated by small gaps; individual nodules globular to ellipsoidal (2:1), rarely
dumb-bell-shaped or elongate ellipsoidal indicating that two or three nodules have not
separated, contain globular nucleoli. Micronuclei near or attached to macronuclear nodules,
globular, inconspicuous because tiny and rather hyaline. Contractile vacuole with two
collecting canals right of buccal vertex, that is, in or near body midline. Cortical granules
recognizable neither in vivo nor in protargol preparations. Cytoplasm colourless, with few,
about 2-3 urn-sized crystals and some lipid droplets 1-3 urn across in posterior body portion.
Feeds on bacteria and coccal green algae digested in vacuoles 4—6 urn across. Glides rather
rapidly on microscope slide.
Cirral pattern very constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 180c-f, i, j; Table 158).
Marginal cirri about 7 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows extending to or near to posterior
body end, right row extends onto dorsal side anteriorly; posterior marginal cirri composed of
two basal bodies only and thus very fine. Only nine frontoventral cirri on average. Frontal
cirri about 10 urn long in vivo, moderately enlarged. Buccal cirrus slightly right and ahead of

Dorsal bristles about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in three rows; details of pattern and
presence/absence of caudal cirri difficult to analyze for reasons mentioned in genus section,
very likely as shown in figures 180d, f, k; in vivo, the cirri at the peak of the tail are incon-
spicuous.
Oral apparatus in —» Gonostomum pattern (Fig. 180a, c, e, i, j). Adoral zone occupies only
slightly more than one third of body length (50% in most Gonostomum species), commences
near midline of anterior body end and extends straight along left body margin, performing
abrupt right bend and slight clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal cavity near left body
margin; composed of an average of 19 membranelles, bases of largest membranelies about 4
urn wide. Proximal portion of adoral zone and buccal cavity almost entirely covered by a
curved, rather prominent cortical process (buccal lip) bearing the paroral membrane. Paroral
as in —» P. binucleatum, that is, divided into an anterior segment with 1-3 and a posterior
830

segment with 2-4 widely spaced, about 8 urn long cilia (Fig. 180a, c, e, f, i, j). Buccal cavity
very narrow and flat, at right bordered by slightly curved endoral membrane composed of
tightly spaced basal bodies. Pharyngeal fibres clearly recognizable in vivo and after protargol
impregnation, extend obliquely backwards.
Occurrence and ecology: The type population was discovered at Namibian site (11),
that is, in a highly saline crust soil. The second population is also from an extreme habitat,
viz., the Warm Spnoran Desert of Arizona, USA, where P. multinucleatum occurred in the
litter and upper soil layer under Ephedra sp. ("mormon tea", jointed firs), a gymnospermous
belonging to the Ginetophyta (collected by Prof. Dr. Stuart BAMFORTH on 21. May 1988 at 11
h 30, when soil temperature was 40° C under Ephedrä). The USA specimens match the type
population very well, both in morphology and main morphometrics (Fig. 180g-k; Table 158).
Likely, Paragonostomum multinucleatum is euryhaline and cosmopolitan.
Comparison with related species: Paragonostomum multinucleatum is, like —»P.
rarisetum, —> P. binucleatum, —> P. caudatum and —> Gonostomum namibiense, a conspicu-
ous species due to the distinct tail. It differs from the congeners and -» G. namibiense, inter
alia, by the number of macronuclear nodules (4-9 versus 2). As concerns the infraciliature, P.
multinucleatum is indistinguishable from —> P. binucleatum. In vivo, it is easily identified by
the gonostomoid oral apparatus, the tailed body, the macronuclear strand, and the lack of
transverse cirri.
Paragonostomum rarisetum nov. spec. (Fig. 181a-e; Table 159)
Diagnosis: Size about 85 x 20 urn in vivo. Lanceolate with conspicuous tail occupying
about 25% of body length. 2 macronuclear nodules. On average 21 right marginal and 15 left
marginal cirri; frontoventral and frontoterminal cirri form single row composed of 6 cirri on
average and ending at 20% of body length; 1 buccal cirrus at anterior end of paroral com-
posed of 6-9, usually 7 kinetids. Adoral zone of membranelles about 27% of body length,
composed of 15 membranelles on average.
Type location: Soil from Aloe dichotoma forest near the Gariganus Guest Farm,
Namibia, 26°30'S 18°25'E (site 5 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Et y-m-o-l-o g y: Composite of the Latin words rams (few) and saeta (bristle ~ cirrus), referring
to the reduced number of frontoventral cirri.
Description and comparison with related species: In vivo, P. rarisetum
was identified as -» P. caudatum, from which it is indistinguishable in size, shape and general
appearance. However, protargol impregnation revealed several distinct features, suggesting
species status.
(i) Paragonostomum rarisetum seemingly lacks frontoterminal cirri, that is, has only a single
row of cirri extending slightly obliquely from the distal end of the adoral zone to the mid of
the frontal field (Fig. 181a, e). The lack of frontoterminal cirri would be a highly deviating
feature in an oxytrichid ciliate (BERGER 1999). Fortunately, we found a late divider, which shows

that two or three frontoterminal cirri are present but aligned to the anterior end of the fronto-
ventral row (Fig. 181e). In the congeners, the frontoterminal and frontoventral cirri form
separate rows.
(ii) The frontoventral cirral row of P. rarisetum, although containing the frontoterminal cirri,
is distinctly shorter than that of —» P. caudatum (extending 15 vs. 25 urn back from anterior
body end; Tables 158, 159), although it consists of six cirri in both. Obviously, the cirri are
more closely spaced and the row commences more anteriorly in P. rarisetum.
(iii) -> Paragonostomum caudatum has a total of ten frontoventral and frontoterminal cirri,
while P. rarisetum has only six on average, similar to —> P. multinucleatum.
(iv) The adoral zone of P. rarisetum is composed of 15 membranelles, while that of —> P.
caudatum consists of 19. Accordingly, the membranellar zone is shorter in P. rarisetum than
in —> P. caudatum: 36% vs. 44% of trunk length; ratio total body length:length of adoral zone
3.6:1 vs. 2.9:1.
Further observations from protargol-impregnated specimens: (i) Macronuclear nodules
obliquely arranged, as described in -> Gonostomum namibiense and shown in figure 181a. (ii)
Two to three cirri, each composed of two long cilia, at peak of tail. These cirri must be caudal
cirri because no transverse cirri are recognizable in the late divider (Fig. 181e). (iii) Dorsal
bristles 3-5 urn long, (iv) Cilia of paroral membrane about 10 urn long and loosely spaced,
occasionally with a distinct gap, as in —» P. multinucleatum.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at four sites in Namibia (Table 4), all in the
Namib Escarpment, indicating that it prefers hot and dry conditions. We cannot exclude
having mixed P. rarisetum with P. caudatum when in vivo identifications were not checked
in protargol slides.

Hemiurosoma nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Oxytrichidae with oral apparatus in Gonostomum pattern and frontoventral
cirri in Urosoma pattern. 2 or less postoral cirri. 5 or less pretransverse and transverse cirri. 1
right and 1 left row of marginal cirri. 4 dorsal kineties. Caudal cirri present. Fronto-ventral-
transverse cirri originate from 5 anlagen, four of which are primary primordia. Dorsal
ontogenesis in Urosomoida pattern.
Type species: Hemiurosoma terricola nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek word hemi (half) and the generic name Urosoma
(tailed body), referring to the similarity with the genus Urosoma KOWALEWSKJEGO, 1882.
Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera: This genus is established to contain two species
described by FOISSNER (1982, 1984) and two new species found in Namibia. FOISSNER (1982,
1984) assigned his species to Hemisincirra (H. similis, H. polynucleatd), while BERGER
(1999) combined them with Urosoma, emphasizing "that they very likely form a distinct
clade within that genus". We could study the ontogenesis in one such form, viz., —>• Hemi-
urosoma terricola. It differs from most oxytrichids s. str. and especially from that of Urosoma
834

by generating not six but only five fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen, possibly due to the
reduced number of cirri. Furthermore, the reduction of the postoral cirri causes all or most
(possibly in the two species still having one postoral cirrus) opisthe anlagen to originate de
novo via the de novo developing oral primordium. This is unusual in Oxytricha but typical for
Hemisincirra (HEMBERGER 1982, 1985) and possibly also some other oxytrichids with a
reduced number of postoral cirri, e.g., —» Erimophrya arenicola and —» Vermioxytricha
arenicola. The occurrence of only five fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen in Hemi-
urosoma is more than a simple quantitative difference because most other oxytrichids with
fewer (e.g. Urosomoidd) or more (e.g. —» Gastrostyla) than the usual 18 frontoventral cirri
still have six anlagen (for a review, see BERGER 1999).
Long after having written this paragraph, we discovered two further groups of oxytrichids
with only five fronto-ventral-transverse cirral anlagen, namely -> Erimophrya and —>
Vermioxytricha. However, the anlagen reduction likely evolved convergently in these three
groups because they have a different oral apparatus (see diagnoses and relevant figures).
Hemiurosoma differs from Urosoma by the reduced number of postoral (0-1 vs. 3) and
transverse (2 vs. 5) cirri, and cirral anlagen during ontogenesis (5 vs. 6). The reduction of the
transverse cirri is very likely not caused by simple spatial constraints, that is, the narrowed
posterior body end, because tailed Urosoma species still have the usual five transverse cirri,
but at the base of the tail, where sufficient space is available (for a review, see BERGER 1999).
Hemiurosoma differs from Urosomoida by the different arrangement of the frontoventral cirri
and adoral zone {Urosoma vs. Oxytricha pattern), and the number of cirral anlagen during
ontogenesis (5 vs. 6). Hemiurosoma differs from Hemisincirra by the arrangement of the
frontoventral cirri {Urosoma vs. zigzag-like pattern; see Hemisincirra species described in
this monograph) and oral apparatus {Urosoma vs. Urosomoida pattern), while ontogenesis is
very similar (HEMBERGER 1982, 1985). However, Hemisincirra is still insufficiently defined
and holds mostly small, slender species that do not fit any other genus well. Several species
were transferred to new genera, such as —» Terricirra BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989a and
Circinella FOISSNER, 1994a.
As mentioned above, two species have to be transferred to the new genus: Hemiurosoma
similis (FOISSNER, 1982) nov. comb, (basionym: Perisincirra similis FOISSNER, 1982) and
Hemiurosoma polynucleata (FOISSNER, 1984) nov. comb, (basionym: Hemisincirra poly-
nucleata FOISSNER, 1984).
Hemiurosoma terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 182a-u; 38lq, 400a-j; Table 160)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 x 20 urn in vivo; slenderly lanceolate. 4 macronuclear nodules
and 21 adoral membranelles on average.
Type location: Soil from the ghost tree forest {Moringa ovalifolia) in the Etosha
National Park, 19°S 15°40'E (site 56 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin terricola (living in soil) refers to the habitat the species was
discovered.
835

Description: Size 120-180 x 15-25 urn in vivo, length:width ratio 5.3-8.7:1, on average
7.3:1 in vivo, scanning electron micrographs, and protargol preparations; slightly flattened
dorsoventrally, very flexible but acontractile. Outline very elongate lanceolate with anterior
end usually transversely truncate and posterior distinctly narrowed; specimens from Namibian
site (29) almost parallel-sided and tail-like narrowed posteriorly, very much like H. similis
(Fig. 182a-c, h, i; 38 lq, 400a, b, g; Table 160). Cells difficult to preserve, usually inflated
and/or wrinkled in ordinary protargol preparations (FoiSSNER's method), while well-preserved
with DIECKMANNS technique (Fig. 182h, i). Macronuclear nodules left of midline in middle
third of cell, ellipsoidal, contain many minute nucleoli; one or two nodules incompletely
separated in about 25% of specimens, quadrinuclear pattern, however, always recognizable;
nodules sometimes in two more or less distinct pairs, especially in Costa Rican and Namibian
site (29) specimens; cells with five or six nodules more frequent in Costa Rican than
Namibian population. Usually two ellipsoidal micronuclei, one each in anterior and posterior
portion of nuclear figure, frequently not impregnated with protargol. Contractile vacuole with
fine collecting canals near mid-body left of midline. Cortical granules lacking; subcortical
mitochondria as conspicuous as in Urosoma spp., about 2-3 x 1-2 urn in size. Cytoplasm
colourless, contains many sand-like crystals 1-3 urn across, mainly in rear body quarter, and
innumerable, about 1 um-sized fat droplets forming short rows and reticular structures (Fig.
182d). Usually packed with 4—6 um-sized food vacuoles containing remnants of bacteria and,
likely, heterotrophic flagellates. Glides slowly on microscope slide and soil particles. Resting
cysts of a population from the Zambezi floodplain globular with smooth, colourless wall (Fig.
400j).
Cirral pattern constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 182a, h, i; 381q, 400a-i;
Table 160). Marginal cirri about 10 urn long in vivo, likely composed of 3-4 x 2 basal bodies,
except for posterior cirri comprising only four cilia. Frontal cirri slightly enlarged, right one
behind distal end of adoral zone. Buccal cirrus right of anterior half of paroral membrane.
Frontoventral cirri right of a minute crest, arranged in typical Urosoma pattern, that is, in a
slightly oblique row with anterior cirrus (= cirrus III/2 in Fig. 182h; for details, see Fig. 38lq,
400f, i and BERGER 1999) somewhat dislocated to left and indistinctly enlarged. No postoral
cirri. Transverse cirri of about same size as marginal cirri, but 15-20 urn long, very near to
body end and thus distinctly projecting, just as in H. similis and H. polynucleata, while
distinctly subterminal in —» H. goertzi (Fig. 183a, j, k). Caudal cirri also 15-20 urn long and
near posterior body end and thus difficult to separate from transverse cirri. Dorsal bristles 3-4
urn long in vivo, much more closely spaced in anterior than posterior half of cell, arranged in
four rows: row 1 slightly shortened anteriorly; rows 2 and 3 bipolar; row 4 consists of only
three to four, bristles in anterior body third.
Adoral zone short, occupies only 14-21%, on average 18% of body length, roughly in
Gonostomum pattern, that is, extends straight along left body margin, performing right bend
and slight clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal cavity; composed of an average of 21
membranelies, bases of largest membranelies 5-6 (im wide in vivo. Buccal cavity very flat
and narrow, right margin forms hyaline lip bearing undulating membrane and covering buccal
cavity and proximal third of adoral zone. Undulating membranes almost straight and in series
or slightly overlapping, both minute and likely dikinetidal; paroral with a small fibre bundle
anteriorly and cilia about 7 urn long in vivo. Pharyngeal fibres distinct in vivo and protargol
preparations, of ordinary length and structure, extend obliquely backwards (Fig. 182a, f, h;
400a, c, f,h, i; Table 160).

Ontogenesis (Fig. 182g, j-u): Division was studied in specimens from type location and
Costa Rica (Fig. 182n, u), which together provided a complete series of events. Ontogenesis
of H. terricola is similar to that of oxytrichids in general and Urosoma in particular because
the proter cirral anlagen are entirely or partially produced by the opisthe via long primary
primordia, a highly characteristic apomorphy uniting the genera Urosoma, Hemiurosoma, and
Gonostomum (BERGER 1999, FOISSNER & ADAM 1983a).

Ontogenesis commences with the formation of a long, narrow oral primordium extending
anteriorly from mid-body (Fig. 182g). Then, two cirral anlagen streaks arise from the anterior
end of the oral primordium and extend to the parental buccal vertex in characteristic Y-pattern
(Fig. 182j). Next, two further anlagen develop from the stem of the Y. Thus, four long cirral
anlagen streaks are recognizable at this stage (Fig. 182k, 1). The long anlagen are primary
primordia, which split transversely, producing a cirral anlagen set each in the proter and
opisthe (Fig. 182m, n). In detail, the process runs as follows: the posterior half of the leftmost
anläge becomes opisthe's undulating membranes and frontal cirrus 1, while the anterior
portion unites with prater's anläge II produced by the parental buccal cirrus; proter anläge I
originates, as is usual, from the reorganizing undulating membranes (Fig. 182o, p, r); the
anterior portion of opisthe's anläge III unites with the proter anläge III produced by cirrus
III/2, that is, the slightly left-shifted cirrus of the frontoventral row; prater's anlagen IV and V
are entirely generated by the anterior half of opisthe's anlagen IV and V (Fig. 182n, o)
because the other cirri of the frontoventral row are ontogenetically inactive and will be
resorbed in very late dividers (Fig. 182r, s, u).
When the macronuclear nodules have fused to a globular mass and micronuclear division
commences, five widely separated cirral anlagen streaks and three dorsal primordia are recog-
nizable in both the proter and the opisthe. Furthermore, the new adoral zone of membranelles
is almost complete (Fig. 182p, r). Next, cirri begin to segregate in the anlagen and the last
cirrus of anlagen IV and V separates from its streak to migrate posteriorly; the migration of
these cirri, which will become the transverse cirri, is very conspicuous in both filial products
because of the short anlagen fields and long body (Fig. 182r, s, u). In late dividers, the
undulating membranes are completed, the cirri migrate to their specific sites, supernumerary
and parental cirri are resorbed, caudal cirri develop at end of dorsal primordia 1-3, and the
globular macronuclear mass divides twice to produce the species-specific four nodules (Fig.
182s-u). Furthermore, a very short dorsomarginal row, which will become dorsal kinety 4,
develops at the right anterior end of the marginal anläge in each filial product (Fig. 182s).
Occurrence and ecology: Hemiurosoma terricola occurred at several sites in
Namibia (Table 4), in a desert soil from Arizona, USA (sample kindly provided by Prof.
Klaus HAUSMANN, Berlin), and in a soil sample from Costa Rica (horse pasture near peak of
Monte Verde, pH 5.5; originally a fog rain forest), indicating a broad ecological (mud of
ephemeral pools to "true" soil) and geographical range. Abundances were considerable in the
non-flooded Petri dish cultures with many active specimens when the cultures were discarded
four weeks after re-wetting. The occurrence at site (56) indicates some salt tolerance.
Recently, a population from the Zambezi floodplain in Botswana could be cultivated in Eau
de Volvic enriched with some wheat grains. The scanning electron micrographs match the
description based on in vivo observations and protargol slides (Fig. 400a-j). Hemiurosoma
terricola is well adapted to the habitat by its long and slender body.
Comparison with related species: Hemiurosoma terricola has four macronuclear
nodules and is thus easily distinguished from H. similis (FOISSNER, 1982), which has only two.
However, all other features are highly similar and would not justify separation at species level.
Generally, H. terricola is easily confused with the congeners and several —> Urosomoida species.
Thus, the following combination of features is important for in vivo identification: body long
and slender (about 150 x 20 urn), four macronuclear nodules, frontoventral cirri in Urosoma
pattern, no postoral cirri, transverse cirri very near to posterior body end, buccal field very flat
and narrow.

Hemiurosoma goertzi nov. spec. (Fig. 183a—i; 381a-d; Table 161)
Diagnosis: Size about 150 x 20 urn in vivo, under certain circumstances about 250 x 40
um. Slenderly lanceolate with short tail. 2 macronuclear nodules, a single postoral cirrus, and
27 adoral membranelles on average.
Type location: Highly saline soil from the Sporobolus zone around the Etosha Pan,
Namibia, 19°10'S 15°55'E (site 60 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Dedication: We dedicate this new species to Prof. Dr. Hans-Dieter GÖRTZ, Stuttgart
University, for his scientific excellence and editorial activities.
Description: This species showed an extraordinary size variability. When it was studied
and prepared from an about ten days old, ordinary non-flooded Petri dish culture, it measured
about 150 x 20 urn. After three weeks, the Petri dish was flooded, which caused strong
reproduction and size increase to about 250 x 40 urn within two weeks! Interestingly, all
other main diagnostics, such as the number of adoral membranelles and marginal cirri as well
as the size of the macronuclear nodules, remained stable (Fig. 183i; Table 161). A similar size
variability has been reported for Urosoma cienkowskii, which was considerably smaller in
protargol slides from terrestrial (FoiSSNER 1982) than limnetic material (FOISSNER 1984).
Thus, the following description is based on material as first obtained from the ordinary non-
flooded Petri dish culture.
Size 115-180 x 15-30 urn in vivo, length:width ratio about 7:1 (range 6-8:1) in vivo, on
average 6:1 in protargol preparations (Table 161); flattened about 2:1 dorsoventrally, very
flexible but acontractile. Outline elongate lanceolate with anterior end usually transversely
truncate and posterior tail-like and curved to right. Cells very fragile and thus difficult to
preserve, tail often inflated in silver preparations (Fig. 183a, b, e, i; 381a, b). Macronuclear
nodules slightly left of midline, about 17 x 8 urn in vivo, ellipsoidal, with many medium-
sized nucleoli. Micronuclei about 6x3 urn in vivo, ellipsoidal, one usually attached to front
of anterior macronuclear nodule, the other to rear of posterior nodule. Contractile vacuole
with distinct collecting canals above mid-body at left cell margin. Cortical granules lacking;
subcortical mitochondria, however, as conspicuous as in most Urosoma-like oxytrichids.
Cytoplasm colourless, contains some ordinary crystals mainly in posterior third and food
vacuoles 4-11 urn across with sporulating bacteria, golden-coloured fungal conidia (11x6
urn), and, rarely, small ciliates. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide and soil particles.
Cirrarpattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 183a, e, g-i; 381a-d; Table 161).
Marginal cirri about 12 urn long in vivo, composed of 4 x 2 basal bodies, except for posterior
cirri comprising only four cilia. Right marginal row usually ends slightly more subterminally
than left. Frontal cirri frequently slightly enlarged, right one behind distal end of adoral zone.
Buccal cirrus right of anterior end of paroral membrane, of variable size, that is, composed of
4 x 3, 4 x 2, or fewer basal bodies. Frontoventral cirri in typical Urosoma pattern, that is,
longitudinally arranged with anterior cirrus (= cirrus III/2, arrowhead in figures 183h; 381c,
d; for details, see BERGER 1999) somewhat shifted leftwards and slightly enlarged. Postoral
cirrus at about 24% of body length and slightly left of midline, composed of 3 x 2, 4 x 2, or 3
x 3 basal bodies. Transverse cirri about 20 urn long in vivo and frequently slightly larger than
marginal cirri, subterminal and thus not projecting posteriorly, usually in triangular pattern.

Dorsal bristles about 3 um long in vivo, arranged in four rows: rows 1-3 about of body
length, each with a single caudal cirrus; row 4 slightly shortened anteriorly and distinctly so
posteriorly (Fig. 183f).
Adoral zone occupies 17-26%, on average 22% of body length, roughly in Gonostomum
pattern, that is, extends straight along left body margin, performing right bend and slight
clockwise rotation to plunge into buccal cavity; composed of an average of 27 membranelles,
bases of largest membranelles about 4 urn wide in vivo. Buccal cavity very flat and narrow,
right margin forms hyaline lip bearing undulating membrane and covering buccal cavity and
proximal adoral membranelles. Undulating membranes almost straight and side by side,
endoral on average 10 urn long, paroral 8 urn long and commencing about 3 urn ahead of
endoral at level of buccal cirrus; both membranes likely composed of dikinetids. Pharyngeal
fibres distinct in vivo and protargol preparations, of ordinary length and structure, extend
obliquely backwards (Fig. 183a, b, e, h; 381c; Table 161).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at four sites in Namibia (Table 4),
ranging from non-saline mud and soil from rock-pools on an Inselberg to a highly saline soil
from the Sporobolus zone around the Etosha Pan.
Comparison with related species: Hemiurosoma goertzi differs from H.
polynucleata (Fig. 183j), the sole congener with a single postoral cirrus, mainly by the
macronuclear pattern (2 vs. 8 nodules in line), an excellent feature because of its high
stability. Minor differences are found in the number (3 vs. 2) and location (subterminal vs.
terminal) of the transverse cirri and the number of adoral membranelles (25-30 vs. 19-24). In
vivo, Hemiurosoma goertzi is characterized by the following combination of features:
slender, slightly tailed body with anterior end transversely truncate; two macronuclear
nodules; single postoral cirrus; distinct mitochondria.

Sterkiella cavicola (KAHL, 1935) FOISSNER, BLATTERER, BERGER & KOHMANN,
1991 (Fig. 184a-z)
Material: Soil from Austria as described in BERGER & FOISSNER (1987), who investigated
specimens from a non-flooded Petri dish culture. Specimens from this source were used to
establish pure cultures in Eau de Volvic enriched with some crashed wheat grains and a
species of the Tetrahymena pyriformis complex as main food source. The protargol slides
containing the dividers shown in the following figures have been deposited at the same
locality as the Namibian slides. Interestingly, this species occurs in Namibia only at site 55
(Table 4), while it is frequent in Germany and Austria (FOISSNER 2000a).
Morphostatic specimens: The interphase morphology of S. cavicola has been
thoroughly described by BERGER & FOISSNER (1987) from an Austrian and a Japanese
population. A critical review of this species has been published by BERGER (1999). Thus,
there is no need to describe it again. The cultivated specimens show a higher variability in the
number of fronto-ventral-transverse cirri than those from the non-flooded Petri dish culture
studied by BERGER & FOISSNER (1987), namely, 17-24 (x = 19.0, M = 19, SD = 1.6, SE =
0.3, CV = 8.4%, n = 21). The increased number of cirri is recognizable also in the streaks of
middle to very late dividers, both in the proter (x = 19.9, M = 19, SD = 3.3, Min = 17, Max =
24, n = 13) and opisthe (x = 20.2, M = 20, SD = 3.3, Min = 18, Max = 23, n = 13). Usually,
the number of postoral ventral and/or transverse cirri is increased, while mostly eight (rarely
9, Fig. 184h) cirri are on the frontal field, as is common. Furthermore, giants with a dispro-
portionally large oral apparatus occur in cultures (Fig. 184n). Such macrostomes often retain
many parental dorsal bristles making the infraciliature rather confusing (Fig. 184q, r).
Interestingly, there is no clear-cut relationship between macrostomy and number of fronto-
ventral-transverse cirri.
Ontogenesis: Divisional morphogenesis of S. cavicola is highly similar to that of S.
nova, as described by FOISSNER & BERGER (1999). Thus, it is not detailed here, but the reader
is referred to the figures and figure explanations. Basically, the cirral primordia originate as in
S. histriomuscorum (PETZ & FOISSNER 1997) and S. nova (FOISSNER & BERGER 1999): UM
-> Ip, II/2 -> Up, III/2 -> IIIp, IV/3 -> IVp, IV/3 -> Vp, IV/3 -> VIp; OP -> Io, OP -> IIo,
OP -> IIIo, IV/2 -» IVo, V/4 -> Vo, V/4 -> VIo (nomenclature according to BERGER &
FOISSNER 1997). Accordingly, FoiSSNER's earlier claim (in BERGER & FOISSNER 1997) that
the opisthe primordia V and VI of S. cavicola originate de novo is an unfortunate mistake
caused by a too superficial investigation of the slides. The origin of proter primordium IV is
as difficult to assess in S. cavicola as in S. histriomuscorum and S. nova because it is close to
primordium V. Very likely, it is generated by cirrus IV/3; however, a contribution of cirrus
III/2 cannot be entirely excluded (Fig. 184h-n). Furthermore, we cannot exclude that postoral
cirrus IV/2 contributes to the oral primordium because a patch of basal bodies develops early
and close to it (Fig. 184d-f); the cirrus, however, remains unchanged (Fig. 184g).
The ontogenetic data show that Sterkiella cavicola, type of the genus, S. histriomuscorum and
S. nova form a distinct group of oxytrichid hypotrichs. See BERGER (1999) for further species
possibly belonging to this genus.

origin of the six cirral anlagen (numbers 1-6). In
the proter, cirrus III/2 develops anläge 3, while
the anlagen 4-6 very likely originate from
cirrus IV/3. In the opisthe, anlagen 1-3 develop
from the oral primordium, anläge 4 is generated
by postoral cirrus IV/2 (arrow), and the anlagen
5, 6 develop from postoral cirrus V/4 (arrow).
Postoral cirrus V/3 (arrowhead) does not form
anlagen and is later resorbed. The parental oral
apparatus is unchanged. OP - oral primordium,

Fig. 184k, 1. Sterkiella cavicola, ventral views of early dividers after protargol impregnation. These figures show a "critical"
stage, namely, the formation of proter's cirral anlagen 4, 5 and 6 and of opisthe's cirral anlagen 5 and 6. Proter's anlagen 4—6
often form a W-shaped pattern (1) and very likely originate from cirrus IV/3, although we cannot entirely exclude that anläge
4 is generated, like anläge 3, by cirrus II1/2 (k). This uncertainty is due to the spatial narrowness of the anlagen. The opisthe's
anlagen 5 and 6 obviously originate from postoral cirrus V/4, that is, not de novo as previously stated (BERGER & FOISSNER
1997). Postoral cirrus V/3 (arrowheads) is, as in Stylonychinae, not involved in anlagen formation and later resorbed. Arrows
mark anlagen in marginal rows. The anterior end of the undulating membranes disorganizes to anläge 1, which will generate
frontal cirrus 1 and new undulating membranes. The anlagen of the proter and opisthe develop completely independently, but
co-ordinated, that is, are always at a similar stage. New adoral membranelles are continuously formed in the opisthe's
anarchic field from anterior to posterior. AZM - adoral zone of membranelles, BU - buccal cirrus, FC3 - frontal cirrus 3, OP
- oral primordium, TC - transverse cirri, UM - paroral membrane. Scale bars 20 urn.

Fig. 184m. Sterkiella cavicola, ventral view of a middle divider after protargol impregnation. Six cirral anlagen each are
recognizable in proter and opisthe. Prater's anlagen 4-6 form a W-shaped pattern, indicating that they evolved from a single
cirrus (IV/3). In the opisthe, anläge 1 (frontal cirrus 1) separates from the primordium for the undulating membranes (UM).
The parental undulating membranes disintegrate anteriorly. Arrowhead marks postoral cirrus V/3, which is not involved in
anlagen formation. Arrows denote anlagen in marginal rows; those in the right row develop earlier than those in the left row.

macrostome individual with 78 adoral membranelles and an ordinary set of 18 fronto-ventral-transverse cirri. Cirri are
forming in the anlagen, and frontal cirrus 1 (arrow) has separated from the opisthe anläge for the undulating membranes. A
small, supernumerary opisthe anläge is recognizable (asterisk). Arrowhead marks disintegrating postoral cirrus V/3, which is
not involved in anlagen formation. The parental undulating membranes and pharyngeal fibres (PF) are reorganized. The
marginal anlagen are distinct. Scale bar 50 urn.

tion. Parental structures shown by contour, newly formed shaded black. Both specimens formed 7 anlagen in
both the proter and the opisthe. o: The newly formed cirri are migrating to their final sites. The cirri not involved
in anlagen formation are resorbed, for instance, cirrus V/3 (arrow), which is now smaller and has an irregular
outline. The undulating membranes are forming in both daughters and still side by side. The new adoral zone of
membranelles commences shaping, but the individual membranelles are not yet finished, that is, consist of three
basal body rows of same length. The parental adoral membranelles do not reorganize. Arrowheads mark
dorsomarginal bristle rows generated at the anterior end of the new marginal rows, p: In very late dividers, the
final cirral pattern is recognizable and the new adoral membranelles obtain their final structure (two long ciliary
rows, one slightly and one strongly shortened row). The new undulating membranes moved one over the other
and thus intersect optically. Both daughters have 21 newly formed cirri, that is, three supernumerary cirri each.
An increased number of cirri is often found in specimens from flourishing cultures. Most parental cirri that were
not involved in anlagen formation are already resorbed. The dorsomarginal bristle rows (arrowheads in Fig.
184o) moved onto the dorsal side (Fig. 184v). Note that daughters separate at distal end of adoral zone and are
smaller and rounder than morphostatic specimens. Thus, there is distinct post-divisional growth and elongation.

Hemisincirra namibiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 185a-p; Table 162)
Diagnosis: Size about 65 * 13 urn in vivo; elongate rectangular. On average 4 macro-
nuclear nodules in series left of midline, 2 micronuclei, 12 adoral membranelles, 20 cirri in
right and 24 cirri in left marginal row, 5 cirri in ventral cirral row, 2 frontoterminal cirri, 1
buccal cirrus, 4 transverse cirri, and 2 dorsal kineties.
Type location: Litter around Stipagrostis roots in a sand dune between the villages of
Aus and Helmeringhausen, Namibia, 26°05'S 16°35'E (site 17 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size 60-80 * 10-15 urn in vivo, usually near 65 * 13 urn, length:width
ratio about 5:1 both in vivo and protargol preparations; flexible but acontractile. Outline
elongate rectangular because of straight margins and evenly rounded ends; dorsoventrally
flattened up to 2:1. Usually four macronuclear nodules forming strand left of cell's midline,
nodules sometimes paired with each one micronucleus in between (Fig. 185a, 1); individual
nodules usually ellipsoidal, rarely globular or irregular, contain many minute nucleoli.
Usually two bright, globular micronuclei attached to macronuclear nodules at variable
positions, prominent both in vivo and in protargol preparations (Fig. 185a, c-p). No cortical
granules. Cytoplasm colourless, with some crystals and food vacuoles.
Cirral pattern rather constant, number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 185a-d; Table 162).
Most cirri about 10 ^m long in vivo, fine because usually composed of two or four cilia only.
Marginal rows end slightly to distinctly above rear body end, right row begins near posterior
end of ventral cirral row, that is, at level of buccal vertex. Buccal cirrus slightly behind
anterior end of undulating membranes. Frontal, frontoterminal, and transverse cirri each
usually composed of four cilia; right frontal cirrus, as is usual, at distal end of adoral zone.
Invariably two frontoterminal cirri right of anterior end of ventral cirral row. Ventral cirral
row terminates at 22% of body length, that is, at level of buccal vertex (23%). Transverse cirri
near posterior margin of cell and thus distinctly projecting from body proper; usually one or
two cirri, each composed of two cilia only, ahead of transverse cirri, likely pretransverse
ventral cirri. Dorsal cilia about 3 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows almost as long as
body; bristles in kinety 2 rather widely spaced. No caudal cirri.
Adoral zone occupies about 23% of body length, invariably composed of 12 membranelles of
usual shape and structure in the 16 specimens investigated; frontal (distal) four membranelles
separated from ventral membranelles by an about one membranelle-wide gap at left anterior
corner. Buccal cavity small and flat. Exact structure and arrangement of undulating mem-
branes not clearly recognizable; both almost straight and usually one over the other forming
rather thick line. Pharyngeal fibres of ordinary length and structure after protargol impregna-
tion, extend obliquely backwards (Fig. 185a, b, d).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, that is, the Namib
Escarpment. In eight slides, we found only 20 specimens.
Comparison with related species: As concerns the cirral pattern, Hemisincirra
namibiensis belongs to the H. gellerti group. However, in both H. gellerti gellerti (FoiSSNER,
1982) FOISSNER, 1984 and H. gellerti verrucosa FOISSNER, 2000a, the ventral cirral row is

distinctly longer than the adoral zone (vs. of about same length in H. namibiensis) and the
right marginal row is only slightly shortened anteriorly (vs. distinctly shortened in H.
namibiensis). Furthermore, both subspecies have cortical granules and more macronuclear
nodules (8-9 on average vs. 4), adoral membranelles (13-17 vs. 12), and dorsal kineties (4 vs.
2) than H. namibiensis. Hemisincirra quadrinucleata HEMBERGER, 1985, which has the same
nuclear pattern, is larger (110-130 urn vs. 60-90 urn) and has more adoral membranelles
(15-16 vs. 12) and dorsal kineties (3 vs. 2); furthermore, its undulating membranes are very
differently arranged, namely, as in —> Terricirra BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989a, to which
HEMBERGER'S species very likely belongs (BERGER & FOISSNER 1989a). In vivo, Hemi-
sincirra namibiensis is identified by the following combination of features: 60-80 urn long;
body elongate rectangular; four macronuclear nodules with usually two prominent micro-
nuclei; right marginal row anteriorly strongly shortened, commencing at level of buccal
vertex.
Hemisincirra inquieta HEMBERGER, 1985 (Fig. 186a-k; 401a-h; Tables 163, 164)
Description of Namibian site (5) population: Size 80-160 x 10-15 urn in
vivo, usually about 120 x 15 urn and thus slightly larger than previous populations (80-110 x
10-15 urn). Length:width ratio near to 8:1 on average (Table 163), that is, slender with
posterior body half tapering and rear end narrowly rounded or bluntly pointed, often more or
less distinctly sigmoidal and slightly twisted about main body axis; dorsoventrally only
slightly flattened (about 1.5:1); acontractile but very flexible. Narrowed posterior body
portion usually stouter in preparations (Fig. 186a, d). On average 28 ellipsoidal (5x3 urn in
vivo) macronuclear nodules scattered between oral vertex and posterior fifth of body; nucleoli
minute. Usually three inconspicuous micronuclei, 2 x 1.5 urn in size. Contractile vacuole
slightly above mid-body at left margin of cell. Cortex thin and flexible, contains a loose
lattice of fibres and conspicuous granules between cirral bases and around dorsal bristles.
Individual granules brilliant yellowish, compact, ellipsoidal to ovoidal, 1-2 x 0.8-1 urn in
size; rarely impregnate with the protargol method used (Fig. 186b, c; 401a, b, d-h). Cyto-
plasm colourless, contains some square crystals and small food vacuoles with remnants of
heterotrophic flagellates {Polytomella) and bacteria. Glides moderately fast on microscope
slide and on and between soil particles, showing great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability (Fig. 186a, d, f; Table 163). Cirri about
8 urn long in vivo, most composed of four cilia, buccal cirrus and some cirri of frontoventral
row consist of even only two cilia. Both marginal rows extend to posterior body end bearing
two transverse cirri and, occasionally, one to three caudal cirri (Fig. 186d, g, h); however, we
cannot exclude that the caudal cirri are marginal cirri dislocated by the preparation proce-
dures, which usually broaden the fragile posterior body portion. Right marginal row consid-
erably shortened anteriorly and thus distinctly separate from frontoterminal cirri underneath
distal end of adoral zone of membranelles. Frontal cirri in transverse row near anterior body
end, not enlarged, first frontal cirrus frequently near gap between frontal and ventral adoral
membranelles, third close to uppermost frontoterminal cirrus. Buccal cirrus in corner where
paroral and endoral abut, inconspicuous because invariably composed of only two cilia.

b Frontal cirri, buccal cirrus, frontoterminal cirri, plus cirri of frontoventral row.
c Identity of cirri uncertain; see description.
Frontoventral row right of midline, slightly longer than adoral zone of membranelles,
composed of an average of eight slightly scattered cirri, of which some consist of only two
cilia.
Dorsal bristles about 3 jam long in vivo, invariably arranged in three loosely ciliated kineties;
row 1, however, consists of only one to three kinetids in anterior body half. Row 2 distinctly
shortened anteriorly (Fig. 186d-f, h).
Adoral zone inconspicuous because occupying only 17% of body length on average,
indistinctly bipartite by small gap at left anterior corner, producing 3 frontal and 10-11
ventral membranelles of ordinary structure. Buccal field narrow and flat, buccal lip covers
proximal third of adoral zone. Paroral and endoral membrane difficult to distinguish, but
862

show a characteristic, double curved pattern (Fig. 186d; 401b): a short, slightly curved
anterior portion (paroral?) with 5 urn long cilia abuts on a longer and more distinctly curved
posterior portion (endoral?); possibly, the short anterior portion overlaps the posterior to some
extent. Pharyngeal fibres comparatively conspicuous.
Occurrence and ecology: Hemisincirra inquieta is one of the most common soil
hypotrichs and has been recorded in a wide variety of terrestrial habitats from all main
biogeographic regions, except for Antarctica (FOISSNER 1998a). In Namibia, the species is
also frequent (Table 4), but saline habitats are less preferred.
Comparison with previous descriptions and related species: The
original description of//, inquieta is rather brief and incomplete because HEMBERGER (1982,
1985) provided only limited morphometrics (Table 164), did not describe details of the oral
apparatus (Fig. 186i), and did not study live cells, overlooking the highly characteristic
cortical granules. Furthermore, he did not give any location (Peru? Germany?). Thus, BERGER
& FOISSNER (1987) redefined the species with a German population. The arrangement and
colour of the cortical granules of//, inquieta is highly characteristic and important. Thus, we
provide our original notes (partially unpublished) on six populations: "yellowish granule
clusters" (Kenyan population 1, studied 1985); "few orange granules around cirral bases and
dorsal bristles" (Kenyan population 2, studied 1985); "brilliant yellowish, compact, 1-2 x
0.8-1 um-sized, ellipsoidal to ovoidal granules in clusters between cirral bases and around
dorsal bristles" (Namibian population described here); "yellowish granules around cirral bases
and dorsal bristles" (Austrian population, studied 1981); "brilliant yellow, about 1 um-sized
granules around cirral bases and dorsal bristles" (German population, BERGER & FOISSNER
1987); "orange-yellowish, about 1 um-sized, ellipsoidal granules around cirral bases and
dorsal bristles" (Iceland population, BERGER & FOISSNER 1989a). Obviously, the arrangement
of the granules is largely constant, while colour varies considerably from yellowish over
yellow to orange.
Basically, the present observations agree with those of HEMBERGER (1982, 1985) and BERGER
& FOISSNER (1987, 1989a), although there are rather conspicuous differences in details and
morphometrics (Table 164). Most differences concern the illustration and interpretation of the
frontoventral cirral row and undulating membranes (Fig. 186i-k). As these minute structures
are difficult to analyze, slight differences must not be over-interpreted. The Namibian
specimens differ from the other populations mainly by the frontoventral row, which is longer
and composed of more cirri; however, the characteristic structure of the row, that is, alter-
nately four and two cilia cirri is the same, indicating conspecificity. This is substantiated by
the German specimens, whose frontoventral row also slightly extends beyond the oral vertex
(Fig. 186j). Only HEMBERGER's population has distinctly fewer macronuelear nodules (Table
164).
Taking all data together, there is considerable variability in this species, even if some
misobservations are assumed. Basically, H. inquieta can be defined as follows: Size usually
90-120 x 10-15 urn in vivo, very elongate (7:1) with posterior body portion narrowed or
bluntly pointed. Usually about 30 scattered macronuelear nodules. Cortical granules yellow-
ish to orange, about 1 urn in size, found only around cirri and dorsal bristles. Adoral zone
indistinctly bipartite, < 20% of body length, composed of 12-14 membranelles. About 11 cirri
in frontal field, 20 cirri in right marginal row, and 2 transverse cirri; frontoventral cirral row
about as long as adoral zone or slightly longer. Three dorsal kineties with row 1 consisting of
only one to three kinetids.

Thin, medium-sized hypotrichs like H. inquieta are difficult to identify. In vivo, it is best
determined by body size and shape, the colour and arrangement of the cortical granules, the
scattered macronuclear nodules, and the short frontoventral row. This combination of features
separates it clearly from, for instance, H. gracilis (no cortical granules), H. gellerti (cortical
granules colourless and in dense rows), and H. wenzeli, three soil hypotrichs described by
FOISSNER (1982, 1987c). The last mentioned species differs from H. inquieta only by the
colourless cortical granules and the distinct caudal cirri, a feature weakened by the Namibian
specimens. Another species difficult to distinguish from H. inquieta is Holostichides terricola
FOISSNER, 1988a. This species also has yellow cortical granules which, however, are
scattered, that is, not restricted to cirral and dorsal bristle bases. Furthermore, the macro-
nuclear nodules form a strand left of midline and the frontoventral cirral row extends to mid-
body. Several —> Urosomoida and —» Erimophrya species are also rather similar, but have
only two macronuclear nodules.
Hemisincirra rariseta nov. spec. (Fig. 187a-g; Table 165)
Diagnosis: Size about 170 x 14 urn in vivo; vermiform. Usually 16 macronuclear nodules
in series left of midline. On average 26 right and 25 left marginal cirri, 2 frontoterminal cirri,
and 7 frontoventral cirri in a row ending near level of buccal vertex. Invariably 2 bipolar
dorsal kineties. Adoral zone bipartited into 3 frontal and 13 ventral membranelles, occupies
about 16% of body length.
Type location: Soil from the Aloe dichotoma forest near the Gariganus Guest Farm,
Namibia, 26°30'S 18°25'E (site 5 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words rara (few) and saeta (bristle ~ cirrus),
referring to the sparse frontoventral ciliature.
Description: Size 120-200 x 10-20 urn in vivo, usually about 170 x 14 urn, length:
width ratio invariably > 8:1, on average near 10:1 (Table 165). Vermiform with anterior
portion slightly and posterior conspicuously narrowed, a tail, however, is not formed;
frequently distinctly twisted about main body axis and serpentine with posterior portion
usually straight or slightly curved; flattened only in oral area, acontractile (Fig. 187a, b).
Nuclear apparatus in central quarters of cell, macronuclear nodules in series left of midline,
rarely in two indistinct overlapping strands; individual nodules globular to elongate ellipsoi-
dal, on average ellipsoidal, nueleoli minute. Usually one broadly ellipsoidal micronucleus
each near anterior and posterior quarter of macronuclear strand. Contractile vacuole slightly
above mid-body. Cortex thin and very flexible, destitute of specific granules. Cytoplasm
colourless, contains many granules and food vacuoles with bacteria and fungal spores. Moves
moderately fast and serpentinely on microscope slide and between soil particles, showing
great flexibility.
Cirral pattern and number of cirri of usual variability, except for the strongly varying number
of frontoventral cirri (Fig. 187a, b, d-f; Table 165). Cirri about 12 urn long and fine, consist
of two rows with only two (posterior third of marginal rows, frontoterminal cirri, rear cirri of
frontoventral row) or three (anterior thirds of marginal and frontoventral rows) cilia each.
Both marginal rows extend to posterior body end bearing two to three spread (likely caudal)

cirri; right marginal row shortened anteriorly by about 15 um and thus distinctly separated
from frontoterminal cirri at distal end of adoral zone. Frontal cirri in subapical, oblique row,
first cirrus invariably in gap between frontal and ventral adoral membranelles. Frontoventral
row right of midline, ends slightly above oral vertex, composed of an average of seven cirri
forming indistinct pairs; anteriormost cirrus of row invariably shifted slightly leftwards.
Buccal cirrus very likely lacking or very close to anterior end of paroral membrane, where a
slightly enlarged granule is recognizable in some specimens.
Dorsal bristles about 5 urn long in vivo, arranged in two rows extending to posterior body
end, left row slightly shortened anteriorly; bristles of right row more loosely spaced than
those of left, except in oral portion (Fig. 187c).
Adoral zone inconspicuous because occupying only 16% of body length, bipartited into 3
frontal and 13 ventral membranelles of ordinary fine structure by a distinct gap at left anterior
body corner; anteriormost ventral membranelle composed of three basal body rows only.

Buccal field narrow and flat, buccal lip covers posteriormost adoral membranelles. Paroral
and endoral membrane close together and staggered, paroral likely composed of dikinetids.
Pharyngeal fibres conspicuous (Fig. 187a, b, d, f, g).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rather
abundant. The species is well adapted to the sandy habitat by its slender shape.
Comparison with related species: This species highly resembles Vermioxytricha
muelleri (FOISSNER, 1986) and -» V. arenicola in body size and shape as well as number of
macronuclear nodules and adoral membranelles. The main difference is the buccal cirrus
which is very likely lacking in H. rariseta. A further important difference concerns the right
dorsal kinety, which is reduced to a few anterior dikinetids in V. muelleri and —> V. arenicola.
There are also several significant morphometric differences, viz., the number of right (43-46
vs. 26) and left (39 vs. 25) marginal cirri and the total number of cirri (frontal, frontoterminal,
frontoventral, buccal) in the frontal field (8 vs. 12). Furthermore, —> V. arenicola has cortical
granules.
There are several other similar species which, however, have three dorsal kineties, viz.,
Hemisincirra kahli (BUITKAMP, 1977b) and Circinella vettersi (BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989a),
or only one dorsal kinety, namely, Hemisincirra interrupta (FOISSNER, 1982), Hemisincirra
vermiculare HEMBERGER, 1985, and Circinella filiformis (FOISSNER, 1982). Certainly, these
species differ from H. rariseta also in other characteristics, but the number of dorsal kineties,
which is very constant in the group, is the easiest feature recognizable also on careful live
observation. Generally, all species mentioned above are difficult to distinguish in vivo, and
thus identification should be checked in protargol preparations. Furthermore, there are likely
many other, as yet undescribed, similar species.
Terricirra matsusakai BERGER & FOISSNER, 1989a (Fig. 381v, 388f, g)
This species, which is rare in Namibia (Table 4) and world-wide, is mentioned to confirm two
main genus features, viz., the dark-green cortical granules and the ellipsoidal food vacuoles.
Both are highly conspicuous but require observation at magnifications of > xlOO.
Euplotopsis incisa nov. spec. (Fig. 188a-h; 402a-e; Table 166)30
Diagnosis: Size about 40 x 30 urn in vivo. Ovoidal with sharp subterminal indentation at
right body margin, where ventral and dorsal cortical ridges overlap. Macronucleus inverted C-
30 Euplotopsis is feminine gender (Article 30.1.2 of the ICZN 1999), which was obviously overlooked by
BORROR & HILL (1995). Thus, the following species names have to be emended (see BORROR & HILL 1995 for
literature on the species concerned): Euplotopsis apsheronica (AGAMALIEV, 1966) BORROR & HILL, 1995 nom.
corr.; E. bisulcata (KAHL, 1932) BORROR & HILL, 1995 nom. corr.; E. encystica (YONEZAWA, 1985) BORROR &

BORROR & HILL, 1995 nom. corr.; E. labiata (RUINEN, 1938) nov. comb, (redescription in BLATTERER &
FOISSNER 1988).
868

shaped. 9 frontoventral cirri (cirrus VI/2 lacking) and 9 dorsomarginal ciliary rows. On
average 19 adoral membranelies. Dorsal silverline system of double-eurystomus type.
Type location: Slightly saline coastal soil from Dugi Otok, a small island at the Adriatic
sea coast of Croatia, 44°N 15°E.
Etymology: The Latin participle incisa (cut deeply and sharply) refers to the distinct
subterminal indentation.
Description: Size 30-45 x 25-35 urn in vivo. Ovoid to slightly rhomboidal with sharp
subterminal indentation at right body margin, where ventral and dorsal cortical ridges overlap
(Fig. 188a-e; 402a); distinctiveness of indentation slightly variable, usually well-recognizable
even in protargol-impregnated specimens (Fig. 188g, h). Anterior right ventral surface with
two flat ridges extending to mid-body; buccal ridge slightly curved and thickened, without
peculiarities. Dorsal side convex, extends onto ventral side posteriorly producing hook-like
indentation (Fig. 188d); with three to four more or less prominent furrows (Fig. 188c), rarely
almost smooth. Nuclear apparatus and contractile vacuole without peculiarities; micronucleus
only lightly impregnated with protargol. Cortex bright, rigid, colourless, sculptured by
various ridges and furrows, as described above. Food vacuoles with bacterial remnants,
concentrated in middle third of cell. Creeps hurriedly on microscope slide and organic debris,
sometimes resting for a few seconds.
Cirri about 20 urn long and fine, invariably arranged as shown in figure 188g. Transverse cirri
usually conspicuously subterminal at level of cytostome (Table 166). Only 3 caudal cirri.
Eight to ten kinetids each in central dorsal kineties. Silverline system very regular, of double-
eurystomus type (Fig. 188f, h; 402b-e; for terminology, see CURDS 1975). Oral apparatus
without peculiarities, adoral zone of membranelles occupies 64% of body length on average,
right half covered by hyaline lip (Fig. 188a, b; 402a).
Occurrence and ecology: The sample from the type location was collected by Dr.
Wolfgang PETZ 2-3 m inshore of the Adriatic sea coast on 27.08.1987. It was a mixture of the
top 3 cm sand and litter layer and had pH 6.3. Although from near the sea, the material was
only slightly saline and contained a typical terrestrial ciliate community with 39 species. In
Namibia, we found E. incisa in two highly saline soil samples from the Etosha National Park
(sites 59, 61). Euplotopsis incisa occurred also in a highly saline coastal soil sample (mainly
litter and dark humus; pH 8.1; collected by Dr. Maria WALDHÖR on 28.02.1993) from
Curacao (12°N 69°W), a small island at the north coast of Venezuela. These data indicate that
E. incisa is a halophile cosmopolitan.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: Our
population belongs to Euplotopsis BORROR & HILL, 1995 because it lacks cirrus VI/2.
Euplotopsis incisa is unique in that it has a distinct subterminal indentation, which is caused
by a specific arrangement of the ventral and dorsal cortical ridges (Fig. 188a, b, g, h; 402a).
Admittedly, this is a rather sophisticated feature, which might even have been overlooked in
some other species. It is, however, present in populations of several saline soils from widely
separated geographical regions (see "occurrence and ecology"). Considering the indentation,
the soil habitat, and the rather unique combination of some ciliary features (9 dorsal kineties
in spite of small body size, 3 caudal cirri only, transverse cirri distinctly subterminal), species
status seems justified for such populations at the present state of knowledge.

Except for the subterminal indentation, Euplotopsis incisa is rather similar to other small
species of the genus with a silverline system of the double-eurystomus type (see BORROR &
HILL 1995 and CURDS 1975 for literature on the species mentioned in the following compari-
son): Euplotopsis affinis (6-9, usually 7-8 dorsal kineties, 4 caudal cirri, usually 40-70 jam
long; FOISSNER et al. 1991), E. bisulcata (8 dorsal kineties, 4 caudal cirri, different cortical
pattern), E. finki (7 dorsal kineties, transverse cirri in two groups, 4 caudal cirri, very
conspicuous cortical ridges), E. labiata (8 dorsal kineties, 4 caudal cirri, with prominent
postoral process; redescription in BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1988), E. parkei (4 caudal cirri,
usually only 8 frontoventral cirri).
Very recently, we found a similar, or the same, species in a slightly acidic (pH 6.0) and saline
(8 %o) soil sample (yellowish sand with patches of iron concretions mixed with many roots
and litter mainly from legumes planted for desalinization) from the Al-Hassa Oasis in Saudi
Arabia. This population matches the cells from Croatia in every respect, except for cirrus
VI/2, which is present (Fig. 402b-e). Thus, it has 10 frontoventral cirri and would belong to
Euplotes (BORROR & HILL 1995).

HETEROTRICHIDA
Of the 643 soil ciliate species known globally, only 24 (4.1 %) are heterotrichs, and possibly
only Phacodinium metchnicoffi (CERTES) and Balantidioides are confined to terrestrial
habitats (FOISSNER 1998a). Likely, some —» Blepharisma and —> Condylostomides species
also prefer soil environments. Interestingly, anaerobic heterotrichs of the genus Metopus
occur rather frequently, especially in occasionally flooded soils, such as floodplains and
marshes. Thus, they can serve as bioindicators for soil anaerobity (FOISSNER 1999e). In
contrast, anaerobic caenomorphids (e.g., Caenomorpha) and odontostomatids (e.g., Epalxella)
are lacking in soil, supporting recent ontogenetic data showing that they are quite different
from metopids (FOISSNER & AGATHA 1999).
Blepharisma bimicronucleatum VILLENEUVE-BRACHON, 1940, bluish variant
(Fig. 189a-e; 403a-c; Table 167)
Material: Specimens from grassland soil (pH 6.6) taken at the bank of a stream in the
surroundings of the Keekoro Lodge, Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, 01°25'S 35°10'E.
Description: Size 60-110 x 20-35 urn in vivo, usually about 85 x 30 urn, 2:1 flattened
laterally. Lanceolate, anterior end bluntly pointed, posterior broadly rounded and somewhat
irregular due to the contractile vacuole, ventral side slightly concave along adoral zone, dorsal
moderately convex (Fig. 189a, b; 403a-c; Table 167). Macronucleus in centre of cell,
ellipsoidal in 37 specimens and reniform to elongate reniform in 24 out of 61 cells investi-
gated; contains many minute nucleoli. Micronuclei minute, that is, about 1.5 urn across and
surrounded by a distinct membrane in protargol preparations; three dividers show two
dividing micronuclei each. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, surrounded by "feeder
vacuoles" during systole. Cortex very flexible, distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows, contains
about 10 rows of pigment granules between each two kineties. Individual pigment granules
about 0.5 urn across, blue-grey to blue-green, cells appear like a pale Stentor coeruleus, that
is, light blue-grey with or without a reddish shimmer (Fig. 189b). Cytoplasm colourless and
foamy due to many vacuoles containing only some granules. Glides slowly on microscope
slide and between soil particles.
Somatic and oral ciliary pattern as in congeners (Fig. 189a, c-e; 403a-c). Thus, only some
details will be reported. Cilia 12 urn long in vivo, about half of the dikinetids has only the
anterior basal body ciliated. One shortened, loosely ciliated kinety right of undulating
membrane. Postoral secant system indistinct. Adoral zone of membranelies J-shaped, that is,
only indistinctly spiralized proximally, individual bases up to 4 p.m wide in vivo and of
different fine structure in various regions of the zone (Fig. 189c): composed of two long and
one shortened row in anterior two thirds of zone; followed by about 10 membranelies each
composed of three basal body rows of equal length; the last four to six membranelies are
composed of only two basal body rows of equal length. Zigzagging portion of paroral
membrane short, that is, about one third of entire length.

Occurrence and ecology: Found in Kenya, as described above, in Namibia (Table 4),
and in a variety of soils globally (FOISSNER, unpubl.), indicating a wide ecological range and
cosmopolitan distribution. Rarely, the pink and bluish variety occurred together.
Comparison with literature data and related species: We consider our
bluish Blepharisma as conspecific with the pink to red B. bimicronucleatum, as redescribed
by FOISSNER (1989), because the colour of the pigment can be changed from red to blue by
light and oxygen (for an excellent review, see GlESE 1973). Furthermore, morphology and
morphometry match well (Table 167). The identity of B. bimicronucleatum is still somewhat
doubtful and carefully discussed in FOISSNER (1989). HIRSHFIELD et al. (1973) consider B.
bimicronucleatum as a variety of B. lateritium, which was disproved by FOISSNER (1989). The
present investigations emphasize the stability of this form and thus suggest that it is a distinct
species. Blepharisma bimicronucleatum is rather similar to B. hyalinum, as redescribed by
FOISSNER (1989) and AESCHT & FOISSNER (1998), which, however, has colourless cortical
granules and only one micronucleus.

bodies associated with distinct fibres. K - somatic kineties, MI - micronucleus, PM - paroral membrane. Scale bars 30 urn.

It is still doubtful whether the bluish blepharismas described in the literature are valid species
or variants of red ones. In any case, none of the blue or grey-blue species matches our
population better than B. bimicronucleatum: B. coeruleum GAJEVSKAJA, 1927 is blue to grey-
blue and has symbiotic green algae; B. violaceae TUCOLESCO, 1962 is violet to red-violet,
pointed at both ends, 200 urn long, and has only 10 ciliary rows; B.falcatum GELEI, 1954 is
dirty grey in colour and has 45 ciliary rows and 60 adoral membranelies; and B. lends GELEI,
1954 is grey-blue and has 60-70 ciliary rows and 100 adoral membranelles. HiRSHFiELD et al.
(1973) mention a bluish-red to blue "B. lateritium v. steint KAHL, 1932" in their review. We
were unable to locate this variety in the literature cited by HIRSHFIELD et al. (1973).
Generally, Blepharisma species are not easily identified, and the genus is in urgent need of a
solid revision. Doubtlessly, there are quite a lot of distinct species in limnetic, marine, and
terrestrial habitats. But many of the "old species" lack sufficient details and need
redescription.

Metopus gibbus KAHL, 1927 (Fig. 190a-s; 404a-o; Table 168)
Neotype material: Neotypified from Corsican population, according to reasons 1,3,4,
6 given in chapter 2.4.2. Three populations were studied (see "occurrence and ecology").
They are quite similar, in spite of the large geographical distance, not only in morphology but
also in main morphometrics (Table 168). Thus, the improved diagnosis and the redescription
summarize all data.
Synonymy: JANKOWSKI (1964b) and ESTEBAN et al. (1995) synonymized M. gibbus with
M. striatus McMURRiCH, 1884. However, this is not justified because, according to the
original description and several redescriptions of M. striatus (FOISSNER 1980c; FOISSNER et
al. 1992, Fig. 88-93 on p. 417; KAHL 1932), both differ significantly in body shape (cp.
figures 190a-c with figure 404d), body size (30-55 urn vs. 80-170 urn), location and shape
of macronucleus (preoral vs. postoral and reniform vs. globular), cortical granules [small (0.7
x 0.4 urn) vs. rod-shaped forming distinct fringe (Fig. 404d, f); thus MCMURRICH named the
organism striatus]], ratio of body length to length of caudal cilia (about 1-2:1 vs. about 3-8:1
as estimated from figures in literature cited above), and length of perizonal ciliary stripe
(terminating on dorsal side vs. on right body margin as estimated from figures in literature
cited above). The species named M. striatus by ESTEBAN et al. (1995) is completely different
from KAHL'S and our M. gibbus and thus misidentified because it is distinctly smaller (38-71
urn) than the populations found by MCMURRICH (1884; 80-170 um), KAHL (1932; 80-120
um), and FOISSNER (1980c; 80-110 urn). Unfortunately, ESTEBAN et al. (1995) did not
provide detailed data about variation and infraciliature.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 40 x 25 urn in vivo. Pyriform due to hemispherical
preoral dome and obconical postoral body portion. Macronucleus in preoral dome, reniform.
Cortical granules about 0.7 x 0.4 urn, colourless, closely spaced. Five perizonal and usually
13 somatic ciliary rows, of which two to three extend onto preoral dome. About 13 dikinetids
with two elongated cilia each produce an equal number of syncilia in anterior portion of dome
kinety 1. About 6 ciliated dikinetids form an equal number of distinctly elongated, synciliary
caudal cilia. Adoral zone slightly shorter than perizonal ciliary stripe, terminates on ventral
side right of midline near posterior third of cell, composed of about 16 membranelles.
Redescription: Size 30-55 x 18-35 urn in vivo, as calculated from measurements of
live specimens and values shown in table 168, assuming a shrinkage of 10-20% due to the
preparation procedures; average values of populations rather close (30-39 x 18-27 urn).
Average "lengthiwidth ratio (1.5-1.7:1) and ratio of preorabpostoral body portion (1.3-1.8:1)
very similar among populations, extreme values, however, rather wide (1.3-1.9:1; 1.0-2.4:1;
Table 168). Overall shape pyriform to ellipsoidal, dorsoventrally flattened up to 2:1. Preoral
dome conspicuous because occupying about 1/3 of body length in ventral view, projects
slightly above ventral and left lateral surface, traverses ventral side almost perpendicularly
and merges smoothly into right dorsal surface near posterior third of cell; central dome
portion hemispherical, broadly sigmoidal in top view due to curved and slightly bulged dome
margin, which forms obtuse angle with ventral surface and merges into anterior left margin of
dorsal side (Fig. 190m-o). Postoral body portion slightly obconical to cylindroidal with rear
end bluntly pointed to evenly rounded. Macronucleus invariably in anterior body half, usually
in preoral dome, reniform, rarely ellipsoidal, about 20-25 x 8 urn in vivo, becomes stouter

(shrinks) under cover glass pressure and in prepared cells; contains numerous nucleoli and is
frequently infested by bacteria in Brazilian specimens (Fig. 404e). Micronucleus usually near
or attached to ventral anterior end of macronucleus, about 6 x4 urn in vivo. Cytopyge
subterminal on ventral side, slit-like (Fig. 190m, q), likely also serving as discharge device for
the contractile vacuole because no excretory pore could be found. Cortical granules, possibly
mucocysts, about 0.5-1 x 0.4 urn in vivo, colourless but highly refractive, orientated
perpendicularly to cell surface and closely spaced in about 10-20 rows between each two
kineties (Fig. 190h; 404a-c, o); stain reddish with methyl green-pyronin and black with silver
carbonate, but are not extruded. Cytoplasm colourless to slightly yellowish, contains lipid
droplets about 1 urn across mainly in preoral dome and numerous, about 5 x 0.5 um-sized,
rod-shaped bacteria (Fig. 404k-m); no specific granule accumulation in preoral dome. Food
vacuoles about 5-10 urn across, contain residues of bacteria and their spores. Swims rather
rapidly and slightly swaying.
Somatic ciliature composed of dikinetids and complex due to the occurrence of dikinetids
with packed cilia, so-called syncilia (CORLISS 1979, KAHL 1932) or "cirri" (JANKOWSKI
1964b), whose proximal portion is slightly thickened in protargol preparations (Fig. 404 1):
ventral cilia about 8 urn long, originate from posterior basal body of dikinetids; perizonal
stripe composed of ciliated dikinetids with about 10 urn long cilia; lateral and dorsal cilia up
to 20 urn long, most originate from posterior basal body, except in anterior and posterior
region, where ciliated dikinetids occur, namely, 10-16 (x = 13, n = 11) about 25 urn long
syncilia in anterior region of dome kinety I31 (except for 1-2 isolated cilia at the anterior end),
ordinary pairs at anterior end of dome kineties 2 and 3, and 30-35 urn long synciliary caudal
cilia at posterior end of 5-7 dorsal kineties (Fig. 190c, n, q, r; 404c, h, 1, m). Ciliary rows
meridionally arranged, except for distinctly curved postcytostomial kineties and some
scattered dikinetids underneath buccal vertex; ventrally slightly more widely spaced than
dorsally; dikinetids orientated parallel or slightly oblique to kinety axis, except for last,
distinctly inclined caudal cilia bearing dorsal dikinetids (Fig. 190k, m, n; 404k). Post-
cytostomial and ventrolateral kineties separated by rather broad glabrous stripe, distinctly
apart from adoral zone of membranelles, slightly shortened posteriorly to leave blank a small,
roughly circular excretion area containing the opening for the cytopyge and contractile
vacuole (Fig. 190k, m, q; 404a, c). Dorsal kineties decrease in distance and become shortened
in preoral dome area from right to left, while slightly elongated posteriorly and thus extending
across pole to blank excretion area; two to three dorsal kineties extend onto preoral dome,
rightmost kinety (dome kinety 1) widely separate from perizonal ciliary stripe, compared to
well-studied congeners, ventral dome area thus glabrous (Fig. 190k-o, q, r; 404h, i). Perizonal
ciliary stripe commences at left margin of dorsal side, follows curvature of bulged ventral
dome margin and terminates on.right margin of dorsal side in last third of cell (Table 168);
about 4 urn wide, composed of five very closely spaced kineties32, of which kineties 4 and 5
are often slightly shortened anteriorly and posteriorly and slightly apart from and more widely
spaced than kineties 1-3. Perizonal dikinetids of rows 1-3 form 38-50 short, straight
("false") kineties usually slightly staggered from dikinetids of kineties 4 and 5.
Adoral zone of membranelles slightly sigmoidal, extends in flat, broad corner formed by
preoral dome and ventral surface, commences at left side and extends obliquely to right body

margin, performs slight clockwise rotation on plunging into very shallow buccal cavity
slightly below mid-body. Membranelles with about 5 urn long cilia, bases up to 5 urn long
and cuneate, structure depends on zone region (Fig. 190p; 404n): one buccal membraneile
composed of three fairly short rows of basal bodies; membranelles of mid-ventral portion
consist of four rows of basal bodies producing short, curved kineties; membranelles at left
body margin composed of two long rows of zigzagging basal bodies, to which a short row is
attached at right anterior end. Paroral membrane in corner formed by preoral dome and
ventral surface, commences near midline of cell and curves to proximal end of buccal vertex,
composed of basal bodies in single line, bears 10 urn long cilia only in proximal third of row.
Pharyngeal fibres extend postero-laterally and curve back almost to oral cavity as a long,
narrow funnel.

Occurrence and ecology: Metopus gibbus was discovered in a sapropelic pond in
northern Germany (KAHL 1927a). We found M. gibbus in soil from Corsica and Namibia, and
in material from a termite hill in Brazil, indicating that it is cosmopolitan. Corsica (neotype
population, collected by Dr. Bruno GANNER, Salzburg, in September 1985): bank of a stream
flowing into a reservoir near the village of Ajaccio (41°N 08°E), soil sandy with grass
remnants, pH 4.1; Namibia: sites 4, 30, 49, 66, 73; Brazil: remnants of a termite hill from the
Amazon floodplain near Manaus (04°S 60°W; for details see MARTIUS 1994, who provided
the sample in 1995).

Comparison with original description and similar species: Our
populations match the original description (KAHL 1927a), which KAHL (1932) later improved,
in size, shape, location of nuclear apparatus, caudal cilia forming syncilia (definitely
mentioned in KAHL 1932), and a perizonal ciliary stripe commencing and terminating
dorsally (as estimated from figure 190b). However, there are some differences, namely the
frontal syncilia and the unciliated ventral dome portion, which KAHL (1927a, 1932) did not
describe. Possibly, KAHL overlooked these features because he found only few and very
fragile specimens, two attributes which were not obvious in our populations. Furthermore, the
glabrous ventral dome portion is difficult to recognize without silver impregnation; and even
the syncilia at the anterior end of dome kinety 1 rarely appear as conspicuously as shown in
our illustrations because they easily separate and loose metachrony under cover glass pressure.
Metopus fastigatus KAHL, 1927a is the only congener with a similar size (40-50 urn), body
shape (broadly pyriform), ratio of body length to length of caudal cilia (1-2:1, as estimated
from Fig. 190i), and location of the macronucleus. However, the species differ significantly in
the number of adoral membranelles (7-8 vs. 13-19), and especially, in that the adoral zone of
membranelles is much shorter than the perizonal stripe in M. fastigatus, which KAHL (1927a,
1932) thus classified in a distinct group. Accordingly, synonymization of M. fastigatus with
M. striatus, as performed by ESTEBAN et al. (1995), must be rejected; in fact, it is curious
because ESTEBAN et al. (1995) found 45 membranelles in their M. striatus, while KAHL
(1927a, 1932) definitely mentioned only 7-8 in M. fastigatus. KAHL, who was a very experi-
enced observer, certainly is above such an error, especially since he found three species with
this peculiar feature.
The syncilia on the anterior and posterior pole area, the blank ventral dome portion, the
location of the macronucleus, and the pyriform body shape give M. gibbus a Cirranter-Mke
appearance (cp. figure 190c with figure 190f; DECAMP & WARREN 1997, KAHL 1932, PENARD
1922). Cirranter belongs to the armophorids, according to the reduced somatic ciliature, the
structure of the perizonal ciliary stripe, and the occurrence of syncilia (DECAMP & WARREN
1997, FERNANDEZ-GALIANO & FERNANDEZ-LEBORANS 1980, JANKOWSKI 1964a, b, SOLA et
al. 1990, 1992). Our data show that syncilia occur in a typical Metopus species, and FoiSSNER
(1980c) described Brachonella caenomorphoides, which possesses a cirrus-like bundle of
caudal cilia (Fig. 190j). Thus, syncilia are not unique to the armophorids, indicating that
caenomorphids and metopids could belong to the same group. However, ontogenesis is
distinctly different, suggesting that both metopids and armophorids should have the same
(ordinal) rank (FOISSNER & AGATHA 1999).

Material: This species is difficult to study because the cortical granules impregnate and
hide the infraciliature. Thus, observations from three populations are combined and no
882

neotype is fixed because the preparations are too mediocre. The first population, from which
protargol-impregnated voucher slides have been deposited, is from Iceland,
Landmannarlaugar, where it occurred in soil and litter from an acidic (pH 4.9) moorland
grown with Carex spp., Sphagnum and other mosses, and some shrubs, such as Eriophorum
scheuchzeri and E. angustifolium (sample kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang VETTERS,
Salzburg University, 1985). The second population is from Namibian site (66), where
excellent silver carbonate impregnations were obtained (Fig. 405a-f). The third population is
a single, excellently impregnated specimen from Kenya, Africa (Fig. 191g, h). Unfortunately,
we did not properly designate the slide and could not find it again.
Description: The in vivo observations are from the Iceland specimens, which are highly
similar to those illustrated by KAHL and FOISSNER (Fig. 191 a-d). Thus only a schematic
figure is provided (Fig. 191i). Size 30-40 x 12-15 urn in vivo, length:width ratio 2.2-3.3:1,
on average 2.5:1 in protargol preparations; inconspicuously flattened dorsoventrally. Oblong
with distinctly projecting preoral dome providing cells with typical Metopus shape; ratio of
preoral:postoral body portion 2.3:1 on average (Fig. 191i, j, k; Table 169). Macronucleus
usually at level of adoral zone of membranelies, globular to slightly ellipsoidal; nucleoli
conspicuous, globular. Micronucleus 3-4 urn across and thus large compared to size of cell,
usually near anterior end of macronucleus. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end. Cortex
flexible, studded with rows of minute (< 0.5 urn) granules hardly recognizable in vivo, but
staining red with methyl green-pyronin and dark with protargol (Fig. 191k; 405f). Cytoplasm
colourless, without granule accumulation in preoral dome and bacterial symbionts; the latter
occur, however, in the Namibian specimens (Fig. 405a, b). Food vacuoles about 5 urn across,
contain many refractive granules about 1 urn across, likely bacterial spores. Swims rather
rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Somatic and oral infraciliature studied in the three populations mentioned above and basically
as in congeners (—» M. gibbus and FoiSSNER & AGATHA 1999). Thus, only some remarkable
details will be mentioned (Fig. 191g, h, j, k; 405a-e): (i) ordinary somatic cilia about 10 urn
long in vivo, caudal cilia 30-50 urn long and thus very conspicuous; (ii) paired cilia occur
mainly on ventral half of preoral dome, while the other dikinetids have only the posterior
basal body ciliated; (iii) all populations have about 8-10 somatic kineties plus 5 perizonal
ciliary rows forming 12-15 short, "false" kineties; (iv) the adoral zone of membranelles and
the paroral membrane appear more conspicuous in vivo than protargol preparations, likely
due to the strongly curved and overhanging preoral dome; (v) adoral zone composed of only
6-9 membranelles in all populations.
Occurrence and ecology: KAHL (1927a) discovered M. minor in sapropelic ponds
near Hamburg, Germany. FoiSSNER (1980c) recorded it from a similar habitat in the Austrian
Central Alps at about 1800 m above sea-level. The sites of the populations investigated in the
present study are mentioned in the Material section above. Two of them are semiedaphic
habitats, viz., moorland and mud from rock pools. This indicates that M. minor prefers
limnetic environments, specifically the microaerobic or anaerobic sapropel. We found M.
minor also in Venezuela, indicating a cosmopolitan distribution.
Comparison with previous descriptions: Metopus minor is a very distinct
species due to the small body size and long caudal cilia. These features, as well as similar
numbers of ciliary rows and adoral membranelles, are present in all populations investigated
in the present study and by KAHL (1927a, 1932) and FOISSNER (1980C); thus conspecificity is

beyond reasonable doubt. KAHL (1927a, 1932) already mentioned the stability of this
"variety", which is emphasized by our investigations and supports the species status given by
FOISSNER (1980c).
FOISSNER (1980c) suggested M. recurvatus and M. recurvatus var. pusillus, both rather
superficially described by VUXANOVICI (1962b), as junior synonyms of M. minor (Fig. 191e,
f). ESTEBAN et al. (1995) obviously synonymize M. setifer KAHL, 1932 with M. setosus and
M. setosus var. minor. We disagree, at least for the "variety" minor, because M. setifer is
distinctly larger, viz. 60-90 urn long and has a much longer adoral zone of membranelles.

Occurrence and ecology: Metopus palaeformis is a common freshwater ciliate and
rare in terrestrial habitats, where M. hasei is much more frequent. It is an obligate anaerobe
lacking conventional mitochondria, like the congeners (ESTEBAN et. al. 1995). Reliable
records are known from Europe (ESTEBAN et. al. 1995, KAHL 1932), Namibia (Table 4), and
Madagascar (Fig. 192a).
Identification and comparison with related species: Our observations
match the original description (KAHL 1927a, 1932) and add significant data on the infracilia-
ture. Thus, identification is beyond reasonable doubts, and the population can serve as a
neotype.
Metopus palaeformis is highly similar to M. hasei, as redescribed by FOISSNER & AGATHA
(1999), except for the lacking caudal cilia. Indeed, this is the sole reliable difference,
especially when the considerable variation both species exhibit is taken into account
(ESTEBAN et al. 1995, FOISSNER & AGATHA 1999). A minor difference concerns the preoral
888

dome, which is more distinctly curved in M. hasei than in M. palaeformis (Fig. 192m, p).
Metopus palaeformis has been kept in culture and studied ecologically for several years by
FINLAY and co-workers (for a brief review, see ESTEBAN et al. 1995). Detailed morphological
data were not provided, although ESTEBAN et al. (1995) documented various cytological
features and the morphological variation by excellent micrographs. The strong variation was
not seen in the specimens from the non-flooded Petri dish culture and seems to be related
mainly to starvation. However, KAHL (1932) observed similar variation in nature and
distinguished a forma typica, ovalis, and attenuates (Fig. 192b—c). Based on the data
available, ESTEBAN et al. (1995) suggest the following synonymy, with which we largely
agree: M. hyalinus KAHL, 1927a (Fig. 192j); M. rostratus KAHL, 1927a (Fig. 192 1); M. tenuis
KAHL, 1927a (Fig. 192k; synonymy doubtful in our opinion); and Tesnospira alba
JANKOWSKI, 1964b (Fig. 192k; synonymy doubtful in our opinion).
Metopus contortus (QUENNERSTEDT, 1867) KAHL, 1932 (Fig. 193a-r; 405i-k;
Tables 171, 172)
Material: Namibian site (49), where it occurred two weeks after rewetting the sample.
Identification: Metopus contortus has been studied by several authors, although in
varying detail (Table 172). While the number of adoral membranelies is fairly similar in the
populations investigated, body size and number of ciliary rows are not. These features
indicate two groups, one with a size around 100 urn and about 30 ciliary rows, and another
with a size near 150 urn and 40-50 ciliary rows. The Namibian specimens and M. jankowskii
DRAGESCO, 1968 obviously belong to the second group.
Of the redescriptions listed in Table 172, only that of DRAGESCO (1996) is detailed enough to
be compared with our data. His specimens match the original description in size, but are more
slender, while our specimens match the original description in shape, but are considerably
larger. Further, the number of ciliary rows is significantly different (x = 48 vs. 31), which
causes a rather different general appearance of the populations (Fig. 193i, o). Another
difference concerns the caudal cilia, which are 23-50 (x = 40 urn) long in our specimens,
while only 16-23 urn in those of DRAGESCO. The macronucleus is more anterior in the French
than the Namibian specimens (15% vs. 27% distant from anterior body end).
These and the above mentioned differences indicate that M. contortus consists of two species
or subspecies, as already proposed by KAHL (1932), who distinguished a forma major and a
forma pellitus (Fig. 193d, e). However, data are still too incomplete for a reliable conclusion.
Thus, and because our population is from a limnetic habitat, it is not used as a neotype.
Observations on Namibian specimens: The somatic and oral ciliary pattern of
the Namibian M. contortus is highly similar to that of congeners, for instance, -» M. gibbus
and M. inversus, as redescribed by FoiSSNER & AGATHA (1999). Thus, the reader is referred
to these descriptions, the detailed figures, figure explanations, and morphometrics (Table
171). The following items list some additional observations: (i) Body only indistinctly
spiralized and highly variable in size and shape, viz., 107-175 x 40-75 um and widened or
narrowed subterminally in protargol preparations (Fig. 193i, m; 405i); (ii) Preoral dome thinner

(Fig. 193i, j), similar to the populations of KAHL (1932) and ViLLENEUVE-BRACHON (1940;

except of the perizonal stripe and the anterior region of the dome kineties, which have ciliated
both basal bodies (Fig. 193k); (x) Perizonal stripe of ordinary structure (Fig. 193k, 1;

proximal portion of zone, as shown in figures 193f-h. (xii) Paroral membrane inconspicuous,
23 um long on average (n = 5).

Condylostomides etoschensis nov. spec. (Fig. 194a-n; 406a-u, 407a-f, j; Table 173)
Diagnosis: Size about 240 x 110 urn in vivo. Conspicuously yellowish due to bright,
citrine cortical granules 0.4 urn across and arranged in closely spaced rows. On average 8
macronuclear beads in moniliform pattern, 37 somatic kineties, and 56 adoral membranelles.
Frontal membranelles conspicuous, extend along anterior third of paroral membrane.
Type location: Highly saline soil from an ephemeral pool at the margin of the Etosha
Pan, Namibia, 18°55'S 16°25'E (site 65 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the area discovered.
Description: We studied two populations of this species. Both are from subtropical
Africa and fairly similar. Thus, the description comprises both, but morphometric data are
kept separate, and the formal diagnosis contains only the Namibian type population, which
could be cultivated for some weeks in local soil percolate enriched with squashed wheat
grains to stimulate growth of indigenous protists, the preferred food of C. etoschensis.
Size 160-300 x 70-150 urn in vivo, usually about 240 x 110 urn. Very flexible and slightly
contractile in anterior half. Overall shape ellipsoidal, hungry specimens laterally flattened up
to 2:1, usually widest slightly above mid-body where adoral zone of membranelles enters
buccal cavity, often narrowed posteriorly, dorsal side more or less distinctly convex, ventral
straight and slightly receding along adoral zone of membranelles, posterior end broadly
rounded, anterior bluntly pointed and slightly projecting above ventral surface (Fig. 194a, b,

collecting canals extending to level of buccal cavity, vacuole and canals stand out as bright
areas from opaque cytoplasm in well-fed specimens. Cytopyge subterminally on ventral side

(Fig. 194a, b, n; 406a, d). Cortical granules 0.3-0.4 um across, citrine and thus providing
cells with yellowish colour, arranged in closely spaced rows between somatic kineties and in
buccal cortex, release fluid content when extruded and produce yellowish zone around cell,
impregnate well with silver carbonate and protargol (Fig. 194d; 406m, s, u, 407d). Cytoplasm
colourless in Namibian type population, yellowish in Benin specimens, usually contains many
food vacuoles with fungal conidia, heterotrophic flagellates (Peranema sp., Polytoma sp.),
ciliates {Tetrahymena rostrata, Halteria grandinella, Cyrtolophosis mucicola), and testate
amoebae {Trinema lineare, Euglypha sp.). Glides slowly on microscope slide and between
soil particles showing great flexibility.
Somatic cilia about 10 urn long, arranged in slightly oblique rows leaving blank small,
circular area on posterior pole; very closely spaced, especially in anterior region of right and
dorsal side. Kineties composed of obliquely oriented dikinetids usually having only the
anterior basal body ciliated, Benin specimens with ciliated dikinetids throughout or at least on
postoral and left lateral surface; about twice as widely spaced on left as on right side, some
kinety fragments occur right of paroral membrane and on postoral right and ventral side,
where kineties form an indistinct suture (Fig. 194a, f-j, m; 406k, 1, n, q, t).
Oral apparatus conspicuous, occupies about 36% (Benin population) to 48% (Namibian type
population) of body length, that is, extends from ventral anterior end to near mid-body (Fig.
194a, f, g, k, m; 406a-i, k, 1, n, t). Buccal cavity large but only slightly concave and contrac-
tile, thus always widely open, even in preserved specimens; buccal wall lined by long
microtubule ribbons originating from paroral dikinetids, stripes of microrubule ribbons
separated by rows of minute, non-extrusive, conical organelles which stain with protargol like
basal bodies (Fig. 407a, c, d). Pharynx small, obconical, contains narrowed posterior portion
of adoral zone of membranelles, surrounded by many fusiform structures, likely membrane
reservoirs for food vacuole formation (Fig. 194a-c, g).
Paroral membrane conspicuous, emerges from small cleft at right margin of buccal cavity,
commences apically and extends to midline of proximal buccal vertex, composed of
dikinetids having 50-60 urn (!) long cilia producing giant velum. Frontal membranelles form
distinct stripe along right anterior third of paroral, composed of closely spaced, about 20 urn
long cilia, indistinctly separate from each other, decrease in size from anterior to posterior.
Along left margin of paroral membrane minute, claviform structures (Fig. 194a, f, g, m; 406c,
e-i, k, 1, n, r, t, 407f).
Adoral zone of membranelles conspicuous, extends in wide spiral from anterior left margin of
buccal cavity to near mid-body, where it curves right and to body centre; number of membra-
nelles distinctly higher in Namibian (46-67, x = 55.6) than Benin (33^4, x = 38.2)
specimens (Table 173). Individual membranelles decrease in size at ends of zone, composed
of two up to 12 urn long rows with about 20 urn long cilia and, at left inner end, a very short
row with cilia only 5 urn long (Fig. 194a, f, g, h, 1; 406o, 407e).
Resting cysts slightly to distinctly ellipsoidal (length with emergence pore: 37-52 um, x = 44
urn, SD = 4.3 urn, CV = 9.8%, n = 11; width: 33-42 urn, x = 37.6 urn, SD = 3.0 um, CV =
8.0%, n = 11), contain semicircular macronuclear mass and many fat globules. Ectocyst
membranous and hyaline, about 5 urn thick, citrine like cortical granules, usually covered
with bacteria and organic debris. Endocyst compact, about 1.5 urn thick, yellowish, forms
globular emergence pore (Fig. 194e; 406j, p).
Occurrence and ecology: Found in several soil samples from the Etosha Pan region
897

(Table 4) and in a sample from Benin (surroundings of Cotonou University; red, very sandy,
litter-poor soil and mud from fields and desiccated ponds, pH 7.3; sample kindly provided by
Prof. Dr. Jean DRAGESCO; voucher slide deposited). The Etosha samples were heavily saline,
and the Benin sample contained material from the margin of a shallow lagoon. This indicates
that C. etoschensis is a semiterrestrial species living on the bottom of saline inland ponds.

Generic classification and comparison with related species: Condy-
lostomides was established by SILVA NETO (1994), with C. grolieri as type species (by
monotypy), who discovered it in a calcium carbonate-rich mineral spring in France. He
characterized the genus as follows: "Le genre Condylostomides est represents par des cilies
d'assez grande taille (250-400 um) depourvu de myonemes, aux cineties relativement serrees
dont quelques postorales, ä la cavite peristomienne triangulaire occupant le 1/3 anterieur de la
longueur du corps, prolongee en un court infundibulum. La frange adorale d'organelles est
semicirculaire peu spiralee ä son extremite posterieure. L'organelle paroral est une double
rangee de cinetosomes, anterieurement doublee sur sa droite par de courts segments de
cineties formant paquets ciliaires distincts". We basically agree with this definition, empha-
sizing the acontractile and ventrally located buccal cavity and the paroral membrane, which is
at the right mouth margin in Condylostomides and deep into the buccal cavity in Condy-
lostoma. Furthermore, the buccal entrance is acontractile and ventral in Condylostomides,
while contractile and mainly at the anterior end in Condylostoma. Thus, these genera look
quite different in the scanning electron microscope (cp. figures 406h, i and figure 407j with
figure 407g, h).
Condylostomides is probably the nearest relative of Linostomella (for a detailed description of
this genus, see FOISSNER et al. 1999), a planktonic freshwater condylostomid which differs
from Condylostomides only by the lack of frontal membranelles (Fig. 407f).
SILVA NETO (1994) did not compare his new species with older descriptions of similar taxa.
Specifically, he did not provide any feature that would separate Condylostomides grolieri
from Condylostoma tardum PENARD, 1922. Both have the same general organisation, a
similar size and shape, and, more important, three macronuclear beads. Thus, they are very
likely synonymous. In our opinion, the following taxa need to be combined with Condy-
lostomides and compared with C. etoschensis: Condylostomides tardus (PENARD, 1922) nov.
comb, (basionym: Condylostoma tardum PENARD, 1922) differs from C. etoschensis mainly
by the macronucleus, which consists of three isolated beads; Condylostomides luteus (KAHL,
1932) nov. comb, (basionym: Condylostoma luteum KAHL, 1932) is considerably smaller than
C. etoschensis (length 100-130 urn vs. 160-300 ^m) and has only two macronuclear beads;
and Condylostomides terricola (FOISSNER, 1995) nov. comb, (basionym: Condylostoma
terricola FOISSNER, 1995), which differs from C. etoschensis in size (90-140 x 30-60 urn vs.
160-300 x 70-150 um), number of somatic kineties (15-18 vs. 25-42, x 17 vs. 33) and
:
adoral membranelles (33-40 vs. 33-67, x 36 vs. 47), cortical granulation (sparse vs. many
:
closely spaced rows), and in the frontal membranelles (more numerous in C. etoschensis).
Condylostomides trinucleatus nov. spec. (Fig. 195a—1; 408a-k; Table 174)
Diagnosis: Size about 250 x 125 urn in vivo; ellipsoidal to bursiform. Conspicuously
yellowish due to brilliant, citrine cortical granule rows. Invariably 3 macronuclear beads, and
an average of 35 adoral membranelles and 30 ciliary rows. A conspicuous, disk-shaped
accumulation of rod-shaped structures near proximal end of adoral zone.
Type location: Soil from Murray River floodplain near the town of Albury at the land
side of Ryans road, Australia, 37°S 147°E.
899

Etymology: Composite of the Latin words tri (three) and nucleus (nucleus), referring to a
main feature of the species, viz., the three macronuclear beads.
Description: Culture trials failed, and abundances were low in the non-flooded Petri dish
cultures from both the Australian and Namibian sample. Furthermore, the species is fragile
and thus most specimens are heavily distorted in the protargol preparations. Accordingly, the
type slides are of poor quality and only meristic features can be reliably measured. Neverthe-
less, all details necessary for a solid description could be collected by combining in vivo
observations, protargol impregnation, morphometry, and scanning electron microscopy.
Furthermore, some excellently prepared Namibian specimens round up the observations (Fig.
195k, 1).
Size 170-270 x 100-135 urn in vivo, usually near 250 x 125 urn; very flexible and slightly
contractile in anterior half. Overall shape ellipsoidal to bursiform with anterior end bluntly
pointed and posterior broadly rounded; subapically a conspicuous bay, where the adoral zone
turns onto left side; laterally up to 2:1 flattened (Fig. 195a-c; 408a). Nuclear apparatus
usually slightly underneath mid-body, invariably composed of three obliquely arranged,
broadly ellipsoidal to globular macronuclear nodules connected by a strand of argyrophilic
material; nucleoli minute and numerous. Micronuclei attached and near to macronuclear
beads, minute (1-2 urn across) and numerous (Fig. 195a, b; 408j, k). Contractile vacuole not
recognizable. Cytopyge in posterior pole area. Cortical granules about 1 urn across, brilliant
citrine and thus providing cells with yellowish appearance, arranged in rows between somatic
kineties and in buccal cortex, impregnate with the protargol method used and thus hide the
ciliary pattern; granules may distinctly decrease in number under suboptimal growth
conditions (Fig. 195d). Cytoplasm colourless and foamy, usually packed with lipid droplets
1-5 urn across, countless lenticular crystals with a size of about 2 x 1 urn, and many small
and large food vacuoles making cells dark at low magnification (< xlOO). Feeds on hetero-
trophic flagellates {Polytomella sp.), ciliates {Plagiocampa rouxi, Leptopharynx costatus,
Cyrtolophosis mucicola, Metopus sp., Dexiotricha sp., Colpoda sp.), green algae (Eudorina),
and fungal conidia. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide.
Somatic and oral ciliary pattern as described in —» C. etoschensis and shown in figures 195a,
e, h-j; 408a-k. Thus, only some deviating and/or interesting features will be described.
Somatic ciliature composed of dikinetids having ciliated only the anterior basal body with 18
urn (!) long, rather stiff and widely spaced cilia. Likely 25-40 ciliary rows, exact number not
recognizable in the protargol preparations. Cilia of adoral membranelles about 30 urn long,
those of frontal membranelles near 40 urn, and those of paroral membrane even 50 urn long.
Adoral fibre system as shown in figure 195j, connected with that of frontal membranelles. At
or near proximal end of adoral zone a conspicuous, disc-shaped accumulation of hundreds of
rod-shaped structures, likely a membrane reservoir for the food vacuoles; accumulation 20-30
urn across and strongly refractive (anisotropic?) under interference contrast illumination,
individual components rod-shaped to acicular, about 12x1 urn in size, become inflated and
globular (3-4 urn across) when artificially removed or in dead specimens (Fig. 195a, f, g;
408e-g,j,k).
Observations on Namibian site (49) specimens (Fig. 195k, 1): The
Namibian specimens, which are distinctly inflated in the protargol preparations, are consid-
erably smaller than those from Australia, at least partially because they were not fully developed,
as indicated by the very low abundance. All other features, especially the citrine cortical granules,

match well. Three of the four specimens found have three macronuclear beads, while one has
only two. The oral and somatic ciliary pattern was excellently impregnated and is as in
congeners. Only the anterior basal body of the dikinetids is ciliated, even in the oral area.
Occurrence and ecology: Condylostomides trinucleatus was discovered in soil from
the Murray River floodplain in Australia. In Namibia, it occurred at sites (4) and (49), that is,
the floodplain of the Bukaos River and road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm. This
indicates that C. trinucleatus occurs in both limnetic and terrestrial habitats. Interestingly, all
terrestrial condylostomids as yet have been found only in Africa, Australia, and Venezuela (a
further undescribed species under investigation).
Condylostomides tardus, C. grolieri, and C. luteus were discovered in sapropelic habitats,
where they occurred together with typically anaerobic inhabitants, such as Metopus and
Caenomorpha. Basically, this applies also to C. trinucleatus, which occurred together with
Metopus spp. in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. On the other hand, it survived for days in
oxygenated culture medium (but did not reproduce), and —> C. etoschensis could be grown for
months under aerobic conditions, indicating that condylostomids are not strictly anaerobic.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: For
generic classification, see —» Condylostomides etoschensis. As concerns the species, we adopt
the concept used in the relative Stentor, that is, we consider the colour of the cortical granules

and the nuclear pattern as main species features. The nuclear pattern, three obliquely arranged
nodules, distinguishes C. trinucleatus clearly from the other terrestrial condylostomids, viz.,
C. terricola (FOISSNER, 1995) and —» C. etoschensis, which have a moniliform macronuclear
strand. Furthermore, body shape (oblong, that is 3:1 in C. terricola and C. etoschensis vs.
ellipsoidal, that is 2:1 in C. trinucleatus), body size (near 110 x 35 jam in C. terricola vs. near

250 x 120 in C. etoschensis and C. trinucleatus), number of ciliary rows (about 17 in C.
terricola vs. 30-35 in C. etoschensis and C. trinucleatus), and number of adoral membra-
nelles (about 35 in C. terricola and C. trinucleatus vs. 56 in C. etoschensis ) are conspicu-
ously different. Additionally, only C. trinucleatus has a conspicuous, disk-shaped accumula-
tion of pharyngeal organelles, while they are rather scattered in -> C. etoschensis and
inconspicuous or lacking in C. terricola (FOISSNER, 1995); however, in C. tardus (PENARD,
1922) and C. luteus (KAHL, 1932), they seem to be as conspicuous as in C. trinucleatus.
As concerns the nuclear pattern, C. trinucleatus matches C. tardus (PENARD, 1922) and its
proposed junior synonym, C. grolieri SILVA NETO, 1994 (see C. etoschensis). Indeed, these
species are highly similar to each other, differing mainly in the colour of the cortical granules:
brilliant citrine in C. trinucleatus, while colourless in C. tardus. As C. tardus was studied also
by KAHL (1932), there hardly can be any doubt that the granules are colourless. Condy-
lostomides grolieri is said to have a "coloration sombre", but the colour of the cortical
granules, recognizable in figure 2 of SILVA NETO'S paper, is not specified. Thus, this species
cannot be identified and is best considered as a junior synonym of C. tardus. Condy-
lostomides luteus (KAHL, 1932), which has citrine cortical granules like C. trinucleatus, is
much smaller than C. trinucleatus (100-130 urn vs. 170-270 urn) and has only two (vs. three)
macronuclear beads.

COLPODEA
The Colpodea were extensively reviewed by FOISSNER (1993c). He recognized 55 genera with
a total of 170 species. Since then, nine new species and seven new genera were described:
Corticocolpoda FOISSNER, 1993a; Idiocolpoda FOISSNER, 1993b; Pentahymena FOISSNER,
1994b; Dapedophrya FOISSNER, 1995; Mykophagophrys FOISSNER, 1995; Hackenbergia
FOISSNER, 1997b; Fungiphrya FOISSNER, 1999a. In the present monograph, four new genera
and 17 new species will be described, and some poorly known species redescribed, raising the
colpodids to roughly 190 reliable species. This shows that the diversity of the colpodids is by
no means exhausted. Indeed, the rate at which we find new genera and species has not
dropped since 1993, showing that a considerable portion of the colpodids is still undis-
covered.
Although morphological investigations (FOISSNER & KREUTZ 1998) and gene sequence data
(LYNN et al., 1999) confirmed and refined some of the proposed relationships among
colpodid orders, others remain doubtful, and evolution within orders is largely speculative.
Unfortunately, the new taxa discovered since 1993 hardly make clearer evolutionary
relationships; on the contrary, the bewildering diversity of the oral structures and silverline
systems confuse them more and more. This is emphasized by the genera —> Platyophryides
and —> Ottowphrya described in the present monograph.
Colpoda formisanoi nov. spec. (Fig. 196b-o; 409a-g; Table 175)
Diagnosis: Size about 35 x 22 urn in vivo. Slenderly to broadly sigmoidal with wide
anterior and tail-like narrowed posterior end. On average 12 somatic ciliary rows, of which
two are strongly shortened on left side. Left oral polykinetid elongate square, consists of an
average of 9 minute kineties.
Type location: Bark of a Colophospermum mopane tree at the Bambatsi Guest Farm,
Namibia, 20°10'S 15°25'E (site 51 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Dedication: We dedicate this species to Dott. Mario FORMISANO (Italy), who illustrated it
in 1957, but did not name it.
Description: Size 30-40 x 15-30 .urn in vivo, usually about 35 x 22 urn, length:width
ratio 1.2-1.9:1, on average 1.4:1; laterally flattened up to 2:1. Shape highly characteristic, that
is, slenderly to broadly sigmoidal with wide anterior and tail-like posterior end (Fig. 196b, c;
409a-d; Table 175). Usually conspicuously indented at oral opening, ventral margin thus
more distinctly sigmoidal than dorsal; indentation varies from almost semicircular to angular.
Preoral keel straight to slightly receding, distinctly serrate. Shape and size well-preserved in
protargol preparations, oral indentation and tail, however, often less conspicuous. Location of
nuclear apparatus highly variable, on average slightly underneath mid-body left of midline,
that is, in postoral left quadrant of cell. Macronucleus globular to slightly ellipsoidal, in 16
out of 18 specimens analyzed with a conspicuous, central nucleolus, rarely with several small
nucleoli. Micronucleus about 3.5 x 2 urn in vivo, attached to macronucleus (Fig. 196b, e, h;

409a, b, d). Contractile vacuole subterminal at base of tail, with single, tubular excretory pore
on left body side. Cortex inconspicuous, flexible, no extrusomes recognizable in vivo or
protargol preparations. Cytoplasm colourless, contains some minute (< 0.5 urn) crystals
sparkling under interference contrast illumination and numerous protargol-affine granules
0.5-1 urn across mainly in posterior half of cell. Feeds on up to 2 urn long bacteria digested
in vacuoles 3-7 urn across. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide and soil particles.
Somatic cilia 10 |im long in vivo, those on tail elongated to 12 urn, without, however,
forming distinct caudal cilia. We checked this very carefully because of the general similarity
with C. steinii, which has two 15 urn long caudal cilia (FOISSNER 1993c). On average 12
ciliary rows following body curvature, composed of dikinetids having both basal bodies
ciliated in oral portion of body, while postorally only the posterior basal body bears a cilium.
Loosely ciliated, except at left side of keel, where kinetids are closely spaced and two
supernumerary, short ciliary rows occur. Left side kineties at margin of rather deep furrows
anteriorly, producing serrate keel described above. Last kinetid on right side of tail very likely
associated with kinety 2. Long transverse microtubule ribbons originate at left side of kinetids
and extend rearwards, forming conspicuous bundles becoming thinner posteriorly, where
kinetids are sparser (Fig. 196b, g-1; 409a, b, e-g; Table 175).

Oral apparatus occupies second quarter of ventral side, inconspicuous, funnel opening about 6
urn wide in vivo. Vestibulum broadly conical, with curved pharyngeal fibres extending
posteriorly. Left oral polykinetid on vestibular bottom, elongate square, consists of an average
of nine minute kineties each composed of usually four cilia 2 um long at proximal end of
organelle and 5 urn distally, do not form a distinct beard as in C. steinii; at distal end of
organelle one, rarely two cilia, followed by a row with three cilia. Right oral polykinetid on
right vestibular wall, consists of four to five, usually four curved ciliary rows forming an
elliptical field; proximal row composed of about nine dikinetids. Cilia about 3 urn long in
anterior portion of field, form curved, membranoid structure (Fig. 196b, e-h, j, l-o; 409a, c,
e-g; Table 175).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, but very likely also
occurring in agricultural soil of Italy, from which FORMISANO (1957) illustrated this or a
similar species (Fig. 196a). Furthermore, we found C. formisanoi in soil from Tunisia and the
Republic of South Africa. However, conspecificity must still be confirmed by detailed
investigations, which are difficult because the slides contain only a few specimens. Certainly,
C. formisanoi is a rare species only occasionally reaching sufficient numbers to be recog-
nized.
Comparison with related species: Colpodaformisanoi is easily identified by the
small size, the sigmoidal shape, and the tail-like posterior end. This is a combination of
features not found in any other colpodid (FoiSSNER 1993c). At first glance, C. formisanoi
resembles C. steinii, which has also strongly shortened left side kineties and a macronucleus
with a central nucleolus. However, the shape of the left oral polykinetid is entirely different
and resembles those of C. aspera and C. elliotti. The two strongly shortened left side ciliary
rows highly resemble C. steinii and —> Dragescozoon terricola, indicating that these three
species build a special group within the Colpodidae. When food remnants have been released,
C. steinii also may have an acute body end for some time.
Colpoda cavicola KAHL, 1935
We split this species into two subspecies according to the presence/absence of micronuclei;
see detailed discussion under C. cavicola amicronucleata. The following diagnosis is based
on the revision of FOISSNER (1993c).
I m p r o v e d diagnosis: Size 40-150 x 25-100 um, usually around 100-120 x 60-80 urn
in vivo. Very small and large, macrostome specimens occur in flourishing cultures. Reniform
and distinctly spiralized. Proportion of oral to postoral section 1:2.6 to 1:3 on average (1:1.2
or less in most congeners). Macronucleus globular. Two or more micronuclei or amicro-
nucleate. Excretory pore of contractile vacuole in posterior pole centre. Usually 40-50
somatic ciliary rows distinctly condensed postorally and in deep diagonal groove. Left oral
polykinetid hook-shaped or crescentic, composed of about 30 kineties. Prefers tree-hole and
bark habitats.
909

Colpoda cavicola cavicola KAHL, 1935 nov. stat. (Fig. 410a-h; Table 177)
Diagnosis: With two or more micronuclei.
Locus classicus: Wohldorf near Hamburg (Germany), where KAHL (1935) discovered
C. cavicola cavicola in a rainwater filled tree-hole.
Remarks: Colpoda cavicola cavicola, comprehensively reviewed by FOISSNER (1993c),
occurs also in Namibia (Fig. 410a-h; Table 177). It could be cultivated with baker's yeast.
Silver nitrate-impregnated voucher specimens have been deposited (Table 1).
Colpoda cavicola amicronucleata nov. sspec. (Fig. 41 la-o; Tables 176, 177)
Diagnosis: Without micronuclei.
Type location: Bark from Moringa trees (Moringa ovalifolia) in the Etosha National
Park, Namibia, 19°S 15°40'E (site 55 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective amicronucleata (without micronucleus) refers to the
main subspecies character.
Description and remarks: Colpoda cavicola cavicola has an as yet unexplained
preference for tree-holes and is one of the few species in the genus having two or more
micronuclei. This feature is very constant in populations world-wide and also found in the
population from Namibian site (51). Accordingly, we classify another Namibian population,
which lacks micronuclei both in raw and pure cultures, as a new subspecies; in all other
features, C. cavicola amicronucleata is indistinguishable from C. cavicola cavicola (Table
177). Thus we refer the reader to the detailed description of this species in FOISSNER (1993c)
and to the figures and figure explanations (Fig. 41 la-o). A slight difference is found in the
left oral polykinetid, which is hook-shaped in Colpoda cavicola cavicola and crescentic in C.
cavicola amicronucleata. Certainly, this is a rather sophisticated feature, which is difficult to
quantify and whose variability is largely unknown. We could cultivate C. cavicola amicro-
nucleata in Eau de Volvic with ordinary baker's yeast as food supply. In flourishing cultures
developed specimens of extraordinary size (length 200-250 urn) and a very large oral
apparatus (about 60 kineties in left oral polykinetid; Fig. 411m, n). They co-existed with very
small (length 70 urn) and ordinary-sized specimens.
Usually, we do not consider the presence/absence of a micronucleus as sufficient to split taxa
into species or subspecies, although amicronucleate populations are excluded from the gene
pool of the species. However, special circumstances suggest such a separation in C. cavicola:
(i) the species is multimicronucleate in populations world-wide (FOISSNER 1993c); (ii) several
seemingly identical species of the Colpoda magna flock can be distinguished by concrete
morphological traits and the number of micronuclei (FOISSNER 1993c), for instance, Colpoda
magna (with vestibular kineties and several micronuclei) and C. orientalis (without vestibular
kineties and 1 micronucleus); (iii) Colpoda species are highly diverse according to recent
sequence data, suggesting that many of them consist of species flocks (NANNEY et al. 1998).

Dragescozoon nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Moderately small Colpodida with hemispherical vestibulum in ventral anterior
body half. Somatic ciliature conspicuously condensed preorally due to the special arrange-
ment of the ciliary rows. Right oral ciliary field composed of single row of dikinetids.
Type species: Dragescozoon terricola nov. spec.
Dedication: The name is a composite of Dragesco and the Greek zoon, meaning an
animal dedicated to Prof. Dr. Jean DRAGESCO (France), who provided the sample containing
the organism and spent a lifetime on African freshwater ciliate research. The genus has neuter
gender.
Classification and comparison with related genera: Dragescozoon
terricola has a clear identity due to its specific somatic and oral ciliary pattern and the curious
location of the macronucleus. The familial classification, in contrast, is difficult because each
of the three main families of the Colpodida contains a genus with a single-rowed right oral
ciliary field (FOISSNER 1993c): Kuehneltiella in the family Colpodidae, Ilsiella in the family
Marynidae, and Avestina in the family Hausmanniellidae. Certainly, the single-rowed right
oral ciliary field evolved independently in several lines, as shown by the Colpodidae and
Marynidae, and thus cannot be used to unite such taxa in a distinct family.
Within the Colpodidae, D. terricola resembles small species of the genus Colpoda (for
instance, C. steinii and —>• C. formisanoi) and Apocolpoda africana, which also has a
conspicuous preoral ridge (Fig. 197i). Kuehneltiella, in contrast, comprises large, predatory
organisms with a huge vestibulum (—> K. namibiensis and FOISSNER 1993c). Within the
Hausmanniellidae, D. terricola resembles Avestina, which is similar in size, ciliature, and
nuclear apparatus. Thus, Dragescozoon might belong to this group. On the other hand,
Avestina is a "left-sided" colpodid, that is, has the oral apparatus and the condensed preoral
ciliature on the left body side. Thus, the general appearance of Avestina and Dragescozoon is
rather different.
Dragescozoon terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 197a-h; 412a-e; Table 178)
Diagnosis: Size about 40 x 27 urn in vivo; reniform. Nuclear apparatus in anterior body
end, macronucleus ellipsoidal and with central nucleolus. 10 somatic ciliary rows and about 5
rows in minute left oral polykinetid.
Type location: Soil in the surroundings of Cotonou, Benin, Africa, 06°N 02°30'E.
Etymology: The Latin adjective terricola (living in soil) refers to the habitat the species
was discovered.
Description: This species was difficult to investigate because its fragility and dense
packing with food vacuoles disturbed live observation and silver carbonate impregnation;
protargol preparations failed, too, for unknown reasons. Thus, most data are from silver
nitrate-impregnated specimens.

Size about 35-45 x 25-30 urn in vivo, usually near 40 x 27 urn. Shape fairly constant and
often similar to that of Colpoda maupasi and Apocolpoda africana, that is, broadly reniform
due to rather distinct, obliquely truncate preoral projection (Fig. 197a, b, e); indistinctly
flattened laterally. Nuclear apparatus invariably near anterior body end, an unusual location
making the species easily recognizable (Fig. 197a, d, e). Macronucleus broadly (about 1.5:1)
to slenderly (3:1) ellipsoidal, on average near 2:1 (Table 178); very hyaline, contains central
nucleolus impregnating intensely with protargol, similar as in Colpoda steinii (FoiSSNER
1993c). Micronucleus not seen, does not impregnate with protargol. Contractile vacuole in
posterior body end with single excretory pore in midline of left side. Cortex bright and
fragile, often does not withstand formalin fixation as used for silver carbonate impregnation.
Extrusomes recognizable neither in vivo nor in protargol preparations, where the cortex is
yellowish or does not impregnate at all. All specimens packed with 3-6 um-sized food
vacuoles containing bacteria. Swims rather rapidly.
Somatic cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, paired in oral body portion, arranged in ten curved
(hardly spiralized as in most Colpoda species), comparatively widely spaced rows anteriorly
more densely ciliated than posteriorly, especially on left side where a conspicuous preoral
ciliary tuft is produced by the densely ciliated anterior end of rows 5 to 8 (Fig. 197a-c, g, h;
412a-e). Ciliary rows very particularly arranged, abut preorally without, however, forming a
distinct suture (for numbering of rows, see Fig. 197f and FoiSSNER 1993c): row 2 extends
parallel to right margin of vestibular opening and abuts on row 8 anteriorly; rows 3 and 4 abut
on anterior portion of row 5; rows 5 to 7 commence between rows 2 and 3, extend across
preoral ventral surface, and then curve posteriorly becoming loosely ciliated; row 8 begins on
the preoral ridge and extends from right to left margin of vestibular opening, producing a
densely ciliated "preoral row"; rows 9, 10 and 1 are postoral, each comprising only a few
kinetids (Fig. 197b, c, g, h; 412a-e).
Oral apparatus subapical, rather large compared to that of small Colpoda species. Vestibulum
roughly hemispherical, with minute, tubular pharynx in posterior dorsal corner, right
' vestibular margin sharply defined, left gradually flattens and merges into body proper. Left
oral polykinetid on vestibular bottom, composed of about five minute ciliary rows. Right oral
field extends along right vestibular margin, inconspicuous in vivo and after protargol
impregnation, where it stains clearly and is composed of about 15 closely spaced kinetids in a
single row (Fig. 197a, d, e). After silver nitrate impregnation, the right oral margin is much
more distinct, very likely due to somatic ciliary row 2, whose anterior portion is close to the
vestibular margin (Fig. 197b, g, h; 412a-e).
Silverline system in Colpoda pattern, conspicuous because of widely spaced ciliary rows; a
median silverline is formed postorally between ciliary rows 7 and 8 and 8 and 9, indicating
that preoral row 8 is a shortened left side row. A widely meshed silverline pattern extends in
vestibular wall (Fig. 197b, c, g, h; 412b-e).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location. The material was a
composite of dark soil and plant litter from the Abomey University Campus and the Godomey
sports field. The sample was rich in colpodids (four Maryna species, see M. lichenicola and
M. minima, several Colpoda species), including two further new species [a new Avestina and
a new genus (?)], which could not be processed because they were rare and several other
species (Dragescozoon, Maryna spp.) had to be studied. Dragescozoon terricola was
abundant already 8 h after wetting the sample, indicating that it is a highly r-selected
914

organism. After 24h it had disappeared, probably due to the changed milieu because fresh
water was added to compensate for the soil percolate used for preparations.
Comparison with related species: This inconspicuous species is easily confused
with other small colpodids, for instance, Colpoda maupasi (length usually > 50 urn, nuclear
apparatus in mid-body) and Apocolpoda africana (nuclear apparatus in mid-body, left oral
polykinetid more conspicuous; Fig. 197i). Basically, however, D. terricola is easily identified
by the almost unique location of the macronucleus in the anterior body end (Fig. 197a, d, e).
Within colpodids, only Kreyella minuta and Orthokreyella schiffmanni are similar in this
respect. These species are smaller (< 30 urn) and have a much more conspicuous left oral
polykinetid than D. terricola. See FoiSSNER (1993c) for a detailed description of all species
mentioned.
We are not entirely satisfied with our data, especially of the oral structures, which should be
re-studied in silver carbonate preparations.

Kuehneltiella namibiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 198a-p; 413a-z; Table 179)
Diagnosis: Size about 180 x 120 urn in vivo. Ellipsoidal with straight or slightly notched
left vestibular wall not covered by right wall. Several micronuclei. On average 90 somatic
ciliary rows and 28 kineties in left oral polykinetid, which forms a conspicuous ciliary plate in
main body axis. Resting cyst ellipsoidal, covered with smooth, about 20 urn thick ectocyst.
Type location: Bark from Sterculia africana near the Ameib Guest Farm, Namibia,
21°50'S 15°35'E (site 45 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: In the raw culture and pure culture trials (see below) ovate, usually rather
slender and small (length about 120 urn) specimens occurred, whose oral structures were
more or less completely reduced (Fig. 413n, o, r). In spite of this, they frequently contained
some or many food vacuoles and occasionally were even of ordinary size (Fig. 198k). Such
probably precystic or injured specimens were also observed in the other species of the genus
(FOISSNER 1993c) and excluded from the description and morphometric analysis.
Size 130-300 x 80-200 urn in vivo, usually about 180 x 120 urn; the largest specimen seen
measured 300 x 200 x 150 urn. In vivo measurements shown in table 179 are slightly selected
for large specimens and thus match the prepared cells, if 5-10% shrinkage are taken into
account due to the preparation procedures. Shape broadly ellipsoidal on average (1.6-1.7:1;
Table 179), usually slightly more slender and reniform than other large colpodids providing
the species with a rather distinct appearance (Fig. 198a); highly variable in details: broadly
ellipsoidal with more or less distinctly projecting vestibular bottom and straight left vestibular
wall, very reminiscent of Krassniggia, Bresslauides, and Corticocolpoda (Fig. 179a, b, h, j,
m, n; 413a, b, f, k); broadly ellipsoidal with more or less distinctly projecting vestibular
bottom and distinctly notched left vestibular wall, similar as in Kuehneltiella terricola (Fig.
198i; 413e, 1); reniform with vestibular bottom neither projecting nor notched (Fig. 198d, e).
Laterally slightly flattened, even if well-fed, right side flat, left convex and lacking diagonal
groove (Fig. 198c; 413d, e, 1); starved specimens leaf-like. Shape rather fragile, that is, often
changes more or less distinctly when specimens are transferred with a micropipette. Macro-
nucleus usually in posterior body half, ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal, never globular, with
reticular nucleolus. Several slightly ellipsoidal micronuclei, each surrounded by a distinct
membrane, attached to macronucleus (Fig. 198a, c; 413g, m). Contractile vacuole in posterior
body end with single, subterminal excretory pore on left side, projects from body proper when
completely filled (Fig. 198c); no collecting canals. Cortex colourless, very flexible, contains
numerous, 3-4 urn long, rod-shaped extrusomes (Fig. 198f; 413h). Cytoplasm without special
inclusions, usually so crammed with large food vacuoles that specimens appear black at low
magnification (< x40). Feeds on various medium-sized ciliates {Colpoda inflata, C. maupasi,
Gonostomum affine) and even on large rotifers heavily deforming the ciliate (Fig. 413g).
Glides rapidly on flat right surface or swims by rotation about main body axis. Never rests,
except when ingesting large prey items; occasionally attaches to bacterial masses or soil
particles (Fig. 198c).
Cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, elongated to 15 urn on bottom and inner surface of vestibular
roof, paired except in posterior pole area. Ciliary pattern and silverline system as in other
large colpodids (Fig. 198m-p; 413a-f, i-1, q). Basically, the about 90 ciliary rows originate

including a specimen with notched left vestibular wall (arrowhead), as is typical for Kuehneltiella. k: An ovate, probably

from the raw culture and thus has an unknown age. Both the ectocyst and endocyst are smooth. The 2-3 urn thick endocyst is
brownish, while the 20 urn thick ectocyst is colourless and very hyaline; its surface is colonized by bacteria. CV - contractile

along the preoral suture and left oral polykinetid coursing spirally backwards, where they
become more loosely ciliated, ending in the surroundings of the excretory pore of the
contractile vacuole. About ten ciliary rows at the posterior vestibular vertex extend onto the
inner side of the right vestibular wall to become widely spaced vestibular kineties seen only
in live and silver carbonate-impregnated specimens. Ciliary rows equidistantly spaced except
for vestibular bottom, where a stripe of condensed ciliarure indicates a postoral (diagonal)
groove on ventral side.
Vestibulum very large, occupies almost entire anterior body half, funnel-shaped with
cytostome right of cell's midline. Right vestibular wall does not overhang left, extends
obliquely from ventral anterior end to centre of right body surface; left wall straight to rather
distinctly notched (Fig. 198a, b, d, e, h-j, m-p; 413a, b, d-f, i, k, 1). Oral polykinetids in
dorsal third of cell, do not protrude from vestibulum, small compared to size of cell. Left
polykinetid extends in main body axis, as proved in CHATTON-LWOFF silver-impregnated
specimens (Fig. 413b, c); slightly curved, on average 45 x 5 urn and composed of 28
equidistant kineties bearing 5 urn long cilia. Right "polykinetid" composed of closely spaced
dikinetids in a single row, to which the vestibular kineties obliquely abut (Fig. 198a, g, m, n;
413b,c,p-t).
Division in reproductive cysts, not studied. Resting cysts globular to ellipsoidal, on average
broadly ellipsoidal, that is, 155 x 138 urn, appear brown and massive at a magnification of
xlOO (Fig. 198j; 413u-z; Table 179). Endocyst 2-3 urn thick, smooth, light brown (deter-
mined in squashed exemplars). Ectocyst 20 urn thick on average, very hyaline, colourless,
smooth, elastic (does not break into pieces or dissolve when cyst is heavily squashed),
possibly composed of many fine membranes; interspersed by many kinds of bacteria in cysts
from "pure" cultures (see below), while only the surface is colonized in cysts from the raw
culture (Fig. 198 1; 413y, z). Cyst content colourless, mainly composed of fat globules 1-3
urn across (rarely up to 10 urn) and an about 25 um-sized vacuole bearing unidentified
remnants; extrusomes retained, form indistinct, 3 urn thick fringe.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, a very special habitat
described in chapter 2.1.2. Trials to cultivate K. namibiensis in pure Eau de Volvic, diluted
garden soil extract, and diluted (with Eau de Volvic) bark water from the original sample
failed, although adequate food {Colpoda maupasi and Gonostomum) was added. Only once,
the species grew for a couple of days in a trial with diluted bark water from the original
sample. This indicates that K. namibiensis was not accidentally found in the bark but needs
this special milieu.
Comparison with related species: Kuehneltiella namibiensis is easily distin-
guished from the two congeners reviewed in FOISSNER (1993c). Both are on average distinctly
smaller (< 140 vs. 180 urn) and have only a single micronucleus and much fewer somatic
ciliary rows (< 70 vs. 90) and kineties in the left oral polykinetid (< 20 vs. 28). Furthermore,
the left vestibular wall is much more distinctly notched in K. terricola and K. muscicola than
in K. namibiensis, weakening the diagnosis of the genus. The resting cysts are also different,
indicating that the three species are rather distantly related. Likewise, all species are very rare
and live in different geographic regions and habitats: K. terricola in arid grassland soil of
Australia; K. muscicola in mosses from Germany; and K. namibiensis in Sterculia bark from
Namibia.
In vivo, K. namibiensis is easily confused with other large colpodids, especially Krassniggia
919

auxiliaris and Bresslauides spp. (right oral polykinetid composed of a field of scattered
kinetids) as well as Corticocolpoda kaneshiroae FOISSNER, 1993a (left oral polykinetid
composed of pairs of kineties). There is no simple in vivo feature separating these species
although, for instance, the paired oral kineties of C. kaneshiroae can be rather easily seen
with interference contrast optics. Thus, silver impregnation of the oral structures is indispen-
sable for a reliable identification.

Family Exocolpodidae nov. fam.
Diagnosis: Colpodida PUYTORAC et al., 1974, as defined by FOISSNER (1993C), dividing
in freely motile (non-encysted) condition. Vestibular opening in anterior body half.
Type genus: Exocolpoda nov. gen.
Classification: It is textbook knowledge that members of the order Colpodida,
especially species of the family Colpodidae reproduce in division cysts, usually generating
four offspring (for a review, see FOISSNER 1993c). When division commences, the trophont
rounds up, despiralizes the somatic ciliary rows, and resorbs the oral structures, which later
are re-built by anlagen fields. We were thus highly surprised to find a "typical" Colpoda
species, viz., Colpoda augustini FOISSNER, 1987c, that divides in non-encysted condition.
Although the reproduction process is the same as in Colpoda (despiralization of ciliary rows
etc.), we consider this difference as a family character. Furthermore, reproduction has been
studied in rather few species/genera of the order, and thus division in freely motile condition
might be more common than hitherto recognized. Indeed, we know a freely dividing
"Colpoda", which produces division chains with four tomites, from the tanks of South
American bromeliads (FOISSNER & CORDEIRO 2000). This still unnamed new genus will be
described later and included in the family Exocolpodidae established here.
Certainly, it is debatable whether the different life cycle is sufficient for familial separation.
In our opinion it is, especially because the family Colpodidae already contains seven genera
making a cladistic classification difficult. Further, the family is not monotypic, as shown by
the new genus from the tanks of bromeliads.
Exocolpoda nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Medium-sized, microphagous Exocolpodidae with small, conical vestibulum.
Left wall of vestibulum overhangs right. Right oral polykinetid composed of few to many
short, more or less distinctly disordered kineties.
Ty p e s p e c i e s: Colpoda augustini FOISSNER, 1987c.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix exo (beyond, devoid of) and the Greek generic
name colpos (Colpoda, bosom), referring to the freely motile division (devoid of division
cysts so common in other members of the order) and the relationship with Colpoda. Feminine
gender.
Remarks: The diagnosis is adapted to the revision of the group by FOISSNER (1993c).
Basically, E. augustini differs from Colpoda and related genera by the life cycle (family
character). Furthermore, it is the sole species having a boomerang-shaped left oral ciliary
field, a distinct feature used by FOISSNER (1987c) to define the species. It is also unique in
having a very thick resting cyst wall (see below).
921

Exocolpoda augustini (FoiSSNER, 1987) nov. comb. (Fig. 198a-c; 414a-q,
415a-t, 416a-v, 417a-w; Table 179)
The following paragraphs summarize observations made on various populations over the
years. Most data are from a Namibian site (39) population, which could be cultivated for
some weeks in diluted soil percolate (Eau de Volvic plus run off from the Petri dish and some
wheat grains for stimulating bacterial growth). Generally, however, E. augustini is difficult to
cultivate; many trials with populations from other sites failed.
All observations match or supplement the original description. Thus, a full redescription is
not necessary, and our contribution will focus on details not mentioned by FOISSNER (1987c,
1993c). Furthermore, we refer to the table with morphometric data and the copious illustra-
tion.
(1) Usually, Exocolpoda augustini is well-recognizable by its shape, which is between that of
C. inflata and C. maupasi with the anterior end more distinctly pointed (Fig. 198a; 414a-
c, 415a, g-i, 416a-c).
(2) The nucleolar pattern is rather variable and thus cannot be used as a species characteristic
(Fig. 414q). Portuguese specimens even have a large, central nucleolus, like Colpoda
steinii.
(3) Exocolpoda augustini is difficult to impregnate with various protargol techniques because
the cortical extrusomes, likely some sort of mucocysts, usually impregnate heavily,
hidding the infraciliature. The extrusome pattern is sometimes highly conspicuous be-
cause it matches the silverline pattern (Fig. 414d, e, g). Other populations, however, have
rather scattered mucocysts (Fig. 414f, h, 416h).
(4) Exocolpoda augustini has a conspicuous preoral keel because it is comparatively long and
the anterior portion of the left keel kineties is very densely ciliated (Fig. 198a; 414a, c, i-1,
415a-e,416a,c,d).
(5) The vestibulum and the right oral polykinetid are comparatively small, while the left
polykinetid is conspicuous, not only because of its boomerang-like shape but also due to
the distal portion which has elongated cilia, producing a rather distinct "beard", as in
Colpoda steinii (Fig. 414a, i-p, 415a-d, 416e-g, 1, n, p).
(6) The resting cysts are globular with an average diameter of 31 urn, which accounts for a
volume of about 17000 urn3 (Fig. 198c; 415 1-t; Table 179). They are unique'by the very
thick and stable endo- and mesocyst wall having a larger volume (about 5000 urn3) than
the encysted cell proper (about 3500 urn3). If the thick ectocyst is added, which has a
volume of about 9000 urn3, the difference becomes dramatic. In similarly sized Colpoda
species, the endo-and mesocyst wall volume is lower than that of the encysted cells, for
instance, in C. maupasi (about 3600 urn3 vs. 5600 urn3) and C. inflata (about 2300 urn3 vs.
2600 urn3), as calculated from the values provided by FOISSNER (1993c). The endo-and
mesocyst, which hardly can be distinguished light microscopically and stain blue with
methyl green-pyronin, have a light to deep honey-yellow colour and appear to be com-
posed of many tightly spaced membranes. They are very stable and can be disrupted only
if cysts are heavily squashed between slide and cover glass. The ectocyst is distinct from
922

the mesocyst because it is colourless, rather hyaline, structureless, and rather thick (Table
179). Usually, there are few to many bright, 2-3 x 1-2 um-sized granules in the ectocyst
(Fig. 198c; 415 1, n, q, s). These inclusions, which are insoluble in water and do not stain
with methyl green-pyronin, might be bacterial spores released from the food vacuoles of
the encysting cell. The rather hyaline cyst content is colourless and contains some fat
globules 0.5-2 urn across. The nuclear apparatus is in the centre and surrounded by highly
refractive, minute granules. As in Colpoda spp., resting cysts with two specimens in a
common wall occur (Fig. 415q).
(7) Exocolpoda augustini has a distinct preference for hot and dry habitats, that is, deserts and
semi-deserts, which might explain the extraordinary cyst wall. Thus, it is rare and infre-
quent in samples from Central Europe (FOISSNER 2000a). In Namibia, it was abundant,
inter alia, in the slightly saline samples from sites 38 and 39, that is, in soil covered with
the shrub-like lichen Teloschistes capensis. The samples were crowded with E. augustini
two days after rewetting, showing that many cysts were present.
(8) Many dividing cells were found in the pure cultures and silver nitrate slides. The entire
process could also be followed in the scanning electron microscope because division
occurs in freely motile condition without forming a membrane. Thus, only two offspring
are produced, contrary to many other species of the order, which generate four to sixteen
daughters in a single division cyst (FOISSNER 1993c). However, basically division of
Exocolpoda augustini proceeds as in Colpoda spp.; thus, we document the process not by
line drawings but by a multitude of micrographs, with details mentioned in the figure
explanations.

Division commences by rounding up of the cell and resorption of the cilia around the oral
apparatus, especially in the area where the oral anlagen will develop (Fig. 416i-p). This
particularity, which has not been described in other colpodids, is important in distinguishing
early dividers from post-dividers, which look very similar, except for these cilia (lacking vs.
present). Concomitantly, the ciliary rows become radially arranged, the vestibulum flattens,
and the cilia of the oral fields are resorbed from the distal to the proximal end of the or-
ganelles. It is at this stage, that the shape of the polykinetids and the arrangement of the basal
bodies within the organelles can be seen very clearly. As in most Colpoda species, the
proximal margin of the right polykinetid is made by a row of dikinetids (Fig. 416i-v). When
cell furrowing commences, the oral ciliary fields and the remaining somatic cilia are resorbed
with new ones concomitantly sprouting within the rows (Fig. 417a-j). Then, basal bodies are
generated at the anterior end of each 4-5 kineties in proter and opisthe, but with the division
axis of the opisthe shifted by 90° relative to that of the proter, as in -» platyophryids and —»
woodruffiids (Fig. 417i-n). Five to six anlagen but only four to five stomatogenic kineties are
recognizable because the rightmost anläge splits transversely: the upper half becomes the
right oral polykinetid, while the posterior half contributes to the anlagen for the left oral
924

polykinetid (Fig. 417k-n). The newly formed basal bodies at the anterior end of the kineties
arrange to oral polykinetids in the very late dividers (Fig. 417h, p, q). However, only half or
less of the basal bodies produced in the anlagen are used, while the others are resorbed. When
the daughter cells separate, they are still globular. Body and vestibulum shaping as well as the
final shaping of the oral polykinetids occur only in post-dividers. The elongated cilia at the
distal end of the left oral polykinetid are very distinct at this stage (Fig. 417r-u).
Family Hausmanniellidae FoiSSNER, 1987
FOISSNER (1993c) thoroughly reviewed the knowledge available about the Hausmanniellidae.
However, some updating is necessary because FoiSSNER (1993c), although mentioning
macrostome formation in Hausmanniella patella, did not recognize that Corallocolpoda
pacifica ALEKPEROV, 1991 is the fully developed macrostome of//, patella. Thus, this genus
and species must be abandoned. Likewise, FoiSSNER (1993c) described the macrostome of//.
patella as a distinct species within the genus Anictostoma, A. terricola. This species must also
be synonymized with H. patella, while the genus Anictostoma FOISSNER, 1993c, too hastily
synonymized with Corallocolpoda by FOISSNER (1993c), is resurrected with the curious
Anictostoma grelli FoiSSNER, 1993a as the type species.
Interestingly, we were unable to produce experimentally macrostomes in H. discoidea, the
second species of the genus. Likewise, we never observed distinct macrostomes in raw
cultures of this species, with the exception mentioned in FOISSNER (1993c), although we
observed it in at least 200 samples from terrestrial biotopes world-wide.

Hausmanniella patella has been reviewed in detail by FOISSNER (1993c). Thus, we comment
only on macrostome formation and morphology.
Induction of macrostomy: Fully developed macrostomes of H. patella occur, albeit
rarely, in raw (non-flooded Petri dish) cultures and were described as distinct genera and
925

species, as explained above. In the laboratory, the process is rather difficult to verify because
the species is not easily cultivated and, in successful cultures, most specimens are macro-
stomes. However, now we have two lines of evidences that true macrostomy occurs in
specimens from Namibian site (15), where the species is abundant: (i) We isolated three
Corallocolpoda pacifica-Yike looking specimens, that is, cells with large, flat oral field from
the non-flooded Petri dish culture and stored the slide in a wet chamber. After a week, when
the cells were encysted for about five days, they were reactivated by addition of baker's yeast.
The excysted specimens looked like ordinary H. patella, that is, had an ordinary-sized oral
field. As the specimens did not grow on yeast, the experiment was broken off. (ii) We isolated
ten small-mouthed specimens from the raw culture mentioned above and added them to a
flourishing culture of small Colpoda species (C. steinii, C. maupasi, C. inflata, C. cucullus)
cultivated in Eau de Volvic with baker's yeast as main food source. This provided a flourish-
ing culture after a few days, composed, at the time of fixation, of about 95% macrostomes
and 5% cells showing all transitions from small-mouthed ordinary specimens to large-
mouthed Corallocolpoda pacifica-like looking cells. Four slides each of CHATTON-LWOFF
silver nitrate and protargol-impregnated specimens from this culture have been deposited
(Table 1). A series of transitions is marked on the cover glass of each silver nitrate slide.

Macrostome morphology: Fully developed macrostomes are readily distinguished
from ordinary specimens, as also evident from the descriptions as two distinct taxa (see
above). Usually, however, fully developed macrostomes are rare and mixed with many
transition stages and ordinary specimens, possibly because H. patella is omnivorous and
becomes macrostomous only when it is forced to feed mainly on motile prey. Thus, morpho-
metry, as performed in table 180, can document macrostomy only partially. Fully developed
macrostomes differ by three features from ordinary specimens: (i) The oral field, which is
broadly funnel-shaped in ordinary specimens, flattens greatly exposing the oral structures to
the cell surface and the prey (Fig. 199a-c). We depict, for the first time, a macrostomous H.
patella just ingesting a Colpoda through the cytostomial slit traversing the "open mouth" (Fig.
199d). This shows that macrostomy facilitates ingestion of large, motile prey. Unfortunately,
vestibular flattening is difficult to assess morphometrically because specimens rarely assume
the appropriate orientation in the silver preparations. Fortunately, vestibular flattening can be
documented by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 418i-l) and even with micrographs from
CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate-impregnated specimens, where the whole, large mouth area
can be shown in a single focal plane because it is almost flat (Fig. 418e-g). (ii) The oral field
enlarges by about 30% relative to body size, which, like the number of postoral kineties, is
very similar in ordinary and macrostomous cells, indicating that macrostomy is archived by
two simple processes, viz., flattening via spreading of the vestibulum and some growth of the
oral structures (Table 180; Fig. 199a-c; 418a—1). (iii) The left oral polykinetid, which is
orientated in an angle of about 90° to the main body axis in ordinary specimens, assumes an
oblique orientation (about 45°). However, this change is pronounced only in fully developed
macrostomes (cp. figures 418a-h). Likewise, it is indistinct in SEM micrographs, possibly
due to some deterioration of the specimens during the preparation procedure.

Material: Protargol-impregnated specimens from Namibian site (42) and the surroundings

terricola. Voucher slides from both populations have been deposited (Table 1). The material
cannot serve as neotype because of problems in identification (see below).
Description of Namibian population: Size 30-45 x 25-35 urn in vivo, usually
near 40 x 30 urn. Calix inverted U-shaped and unflattened, rather distinctly set off from
small, obconical uvula; prepared specimens more globular and with uvula less distinctly set
off (Fig. 200a, e, f). Nuclear apparatus slightly underneath mid-body on average. Macro-
nucleus globular, with reticular nucleolus. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, globular,
with distinct membrane. Contractile vacuole in uvula, with excretory pore in centre of
terminal uvula surface. Cortex thin, flexible, extrusomes recognizable neither in vivo nor in

drawn to scale and only very slightly schematized because the preparations are of excellent quality, a: Left lateral optical
section at level of oral apparatus of a representative specimen packed with food vacuoles. A dark zone composed of small
lipid (?) droplets is dorsal of the oral apparatus. The caudal cilia are rather stiff and about twice as long as the ordinary
somatic cilia (cp. figure 419a). Mucocysts and a case are very likely lacking, b, c: Same specimen, oblique anterior and
posterior polar view of ciliary pattern. The ciliary rows have a strongly spiral course and are composed of dikinetids. The
kinetids of the elongated caudal cilia form a conspicuous, semicircular array on the ventrolateral uvula margin, that is,
originate from the last kinetid of about 12 postoral and left lateral ciliary rows. The uvula is indistinctly set off from the calix
and contains the contractile vacuole, whose excretory pore is in the centre of the terminal surface, d: Posterior polar view of
the somatic and oral ciliary pattern of a M. ovata specimen from the sample containing —> Dragescozoon terricola. The
ciliary pattern is obviously very similar to that of M. lichenicola (b, c). However, M. ovata is considerably larger (b-d are at
same scale!) and thus has more ciliary rows. Furthermore, the uvula is a conspicuous plug distinctly set off from the calix
(indicated by stippled lateral uvula surface). Thus, the Namibian Maryna is very likely not M. ovata. Asterisk marks
vestibular entrance. CC - caudal cilia, OA - oral apparatus, SU - preoral suture. Scale bars 15 urn.

silver carbonate and protargol preparations. Cytoplasm colourless, without brown flakes, but
with many minute (< 0.5 (am) crystals sparkling under interference contrast illumination.
Dorsal of oral apparatus a dark zone (at low magnification and bright field illumination)
composed of many refractive lipid (?) droplets about 2 urn across. Cell usually packed with
food vacuoles, each containing only few bacteria or bacterial remnants. Swims rather rapidly
in narrow spiral.
Somatic cilia about 8 urn long in vivo, paired, arranged in strongly spiral rows and thus
difficult to count. Flattened specimens show about 28 rows (Fig. 419h-k), which is rather
close to the 25 rows counted in protargol preparations (Table 181). Row pattern as in M.
ovata (Fig. 200d; FOISSNER 1993c) and shown in figures 200b, c, e, fand figures 419d-k.
Preoral suture straight and spoon-like widened apically. Terminal uvula surface without cilia,
contains excretory pore of contractile vacuole. Caudal cilia about twice as long (15 urn) as
ordinary somatic cilia and rather stiff and distinct in vivo, originate from last kinetid of about
12 ciliary rows left of oral apparatus; form conspicuous, semicircular array on ventrolateral
margin of uvula (Fig. 200a, c; 419a, e, f, h, j); very likely, only one basal body of the
dikinetids is ciliated because merely about 10 caudal cilia are recognizable in vivo. Silverline
system as in other members of genus, that is, in Colpoda pattern, seen only in Benin
population.
Oral apparatus rather large compared to size of cell, of ordinary structure (Fig. 200a, c, e, g;
419a, b, d, g, j; Table 181). Vestibulum extends to mid-body, entrance in rear body third. Left
oral polykinetid roughly elliptical because narrowed at both ends. Right polykinetid com-
posed of rather regularly arranged, curved ciliary rows, of which the innermost is dikinetidal.

Occurrence and ecology: In Namibia, M. lichenicola occurred only at site (42), that
is, in rock-pools containing a thin soil layer mixed with lichen and grass litter. This is similar
to the type location, viz., lichens and tree mosses in Hungary (GELEI 1950b). BUITKAMP
(1975) isolated M. lichenicola, as we did in Cotonou, from a grassland soil near an ecological
station in Lamto (Ivory Coast, Africa). However, the identification is uncertain (FoiSSNER 1993c).
931

Comparison with previous descriptions: Small marynids are difficult to
identify. The Namibian population does not fit well to any of the described species reviewed
in FOISSNER (1993c), mainly due to the lack of a case. As the Namibian specimens apparently
lack mucocysts, they very likely cannot build a lorica. If this is true, they would belong to a
new species. Unfortunately, the lack of a case is difficult to prove without permanent cultures.
Thus, we prefer to identify our population with M. lichenicola, a rather superficially described
species from Hungary, which is similar to the Namibian specimens in size, shape of body and
macronucleus, and the rather short caudal cilia. Alternatively, the Namibian population may
be considered as a small "variety" of M. ovata, which, however, is distinctly larger (length >
40 urn) and has a more sharply defined uvula (Fig. 200d and FOISSNER 1993c).
The second population from Cotonou is morphologically and morphometncally very similar
to the Namibian specimens (Table 181). Furthermore, it also lacks a case. Thus, this species
has a firm identity. However, European populations must be studied to confirm/reject our
identification.
Maryna minima (GELEI, 1950b) FOISSNER, 1993c (Fig. 201a-d; 420a-k)
Material: If not otherwise stated, all observations are from a Tunisian population. Some
data are from Cotonou, Benin, where M. minima occurred in the same sample as —>
Dragescozoon terricola (Fig. 420j, k). Unfortunately, material was too sparse for permanent
preparations at both sites. Thus, detailed morphometrics and illustrations cannot be provided.
Description of Tunisian population: Size about 25 x 20 urn in vivo, that is,
almost globular with minute uvula wart-like projecting from midline of rear end; diagonal
(postoral) groove lacking both in vivo and silver preparations (Fig. 201a; 420a, b, h-j).
Impaired specimens more slender and ovoidal (Fig. 201b). Nuclear apparatus sub-equatorial
and thus often hides oral apparatus in silver carbonate preparations (Fig. 201a; 420c, f, h).
Macronucleus about 7 urn across in vivo, with globular, central nucleolus or several small,
scattered nucleoli. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, lenticular, about 3 urn long,
compact and thus highly refractive. Contractile vacuole and excretory pore at dorsal margin
of uvula. Cortex flexible and without extrusomes; minute (< 0.5 urn) granules stain in the
Namibian specimens after addition of methyl green-pyronin. Cytoplasm rather hyaline, cells
thus greyish or brownish at low magnification, contains many minute (< 0.5 urn) crystals
conspicuously sparkling under interference contrast illumination. Often packed with compact
food vacuoles 2-4 urn across during the acidic phase and up to 10 urn in the alkaline state,
where the content is loose. Feeds mainly on minute, curved bacteria. Swims extremely
rapidly.
Calix cilia 10 urn long in vivo, arranged in about 15 slightly spiral, subterminally not
condensed rows, obviously due to the lacking diagonal groove. About 15 kinetids in longest
kineties. Preoral suture indistinct. On distal end of uvula a semicircular array of slightly
elongated, 12 urn long cilia originating from a conspicuous, fan-like array of about six minute
ciliary rows (Fig. 201a, c; 420a, d-f, h-k).
932

Oral apparatus near posterior end of cell. Vestibulum conical and rather flat, cilia of oral
polykinetids thus project from oral opening, those of left polykinetid form a distinct beard
(Fig. 201a, b). Left oral polykinetid about 7x3 urn in vivo, consists of 10-12 (x = 11, n = 4;
silver carbonate impregnation) rows with about 6 |im long cilia. Right polykinetid of similar
size as left, consists of about 4-6 slightly irregular rows having 3—4 urn long cilia (Fig. 201c;
420a,d,f-h,j,k).
Occurrence and ecology: GELEI (1950b) discovered M. minima in soda puddles near
Szeged, Hungary. DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1986) probably found it in soil from
Benin (see FOISSNER 1993c for nomenclature and taxonomy), as we did (same sample as —»
Dragescozoon terricola). In Namibia, M. minima occurred at several saline and non-saline
sites (Table 4). Abundances, however, were low. In Tunisia, we found M. minima about 200
m inshore of Cape Bon (37°N 13°E) in a sample composed of brownish sand, grass litter, and
litter and roots from Erica multiflora and Andromeda sp. The sample, kindly collected by
Mag. Aline BERTHOLD, was slightly saline and had pH 7.7. Obviously, M. minima is
euryhaline and has a wide geographic distribution.
Fig. 201a-d. Maryna minima, Tunisian specimens (a-c) and Hungarian type specimen (d, from GELEI 1950b) from life (a,
b), after silver carbonate impregnation (c), and mercuric chloride preservation (d). a: Right side view of a representative
specimen with slightly elongated (12 (im) uvula cilia. Arrow marks excretory pore of contractile vacuole, whose location at
the dorsal uvula margin is an important feature of this species. The oral cilia project distinctly from the flat vestibulum. b:
Slightly impaired specimens are ovoidal. c: Oral and uvula ciliature. The right oral polykinetid consists of several distinct
ciliary rows. Thus, the species belongs to Maryna and not to Ilsiella, whose right ciliary field consists of a single row of
dikinetids (FOISSNER 1993c). The arrow marks a minute, densely ciliated row in the upper left oral region. This row is more
conspicuous in the Benin specimens (Fig. 201j, k). The minute, fan-like arranged uvula kineties make the species easily
recognizable in silver slides, d: Hungarian type specimen, length about 25 urn. The uvula cilia appear like elongated caudal
cilia because GELEI (1950b) did not illustrate the other cilia, which are also very long (10 urn) compared to the size of the
cell (Fig. 201a). Thus, M. minima lacks distinctly elongated caudal cilia. LP - left oral polykinetid, MA - macronucleus, OA
- oral apparatus, RP - right oral polykinetid, SK - somatic ciliary rows right of oral opening. Scale bar 10 urn.
933

Comparison with original description (GELEI 1950b): This minute species has
not been reported since the original description (FoiSSNER 1993c), with which our observa-
tions largely agree, especially as concerns the unusual location of the contractile vacuole, that
is, not within the uvula but at its dorsal margin. Furthermore, GELEI describes and illustrates,
albeit vaguely, another important feature of M. minima, viz., the minute uvula kineties, whose
fan-like arrangement makes this species so easily recognizable in silver preparations (Fig.
420a, d, e, f, k). However, GELEI describes a "tuft of distinctly elongated caudal cilia", which
are lacking in our specimens, although the uvula cilia are slightly longer (12 urn) than the
calix cilia (10 urn). On the other hand, GELEI does not provide any measurements of cilia
length and mentions that "the somatic cilia are long", which is indeed the case if compared
with the small size of the organism. If the somatic cilia were removed from our figure 201a,
the organism would look very similar to GELEl's illustration, here reproduced as figure 201d.
GELEI also mentions that M. minima often rests for a long time and thus probably lives in a
case. Our specimens neither rested nor built a lorica. Taken together all data, our identifica-
tion is likely correct. If the interpretation of the caudal cilia is not accepted or disproved by
investigations on European material, than our population must be classified as a new species,
similar to M. minima but without caudal cilia.
At the present state of knowledge, M. minima can be characterized as follows: Minute, that is,
20-30 urn; almost globular. Macronucleus globular. Contractile vacuole at dorsal margin of
uvula. About 13-16 somatic ciliary rows and circa 11 rows in left oral polykinetid. Uvula
very small and thus with only few, short kineties showing a remarkable fan-like arrangement.
Accordingly, M. minima is distinctly different from M. antarctica FOISSNER, 1993c, the sole
congener with such a small size. In vivo, M. minima can easily be confused with marynids of
the genus Ilsiella, which have a similar size, shape, and location of the oral apparatus.
Maryna namibiensis nov. spec.
Diagnosis: Size 80-160 x 65-130 urn in vivo. Broadly pyriform with large uvula
distinctly set off from body proper by deep postoral groove. Macronucleus globular or
ellipsoidal; two or more micronuclei. On average 60-80 somatic ciliary rows and 30—43
kineties in left oral polykinetid.
Generic classification: Maryna namibiensis looks rather similar to certain medium-
sized species of the genus Colpoda, especially C. henneguyi and C. variabilis, as reviewed in
FoiSSNER (1993c). However, it is a true Maryna species because (i) the oral funnel and the
pharyngeal fibres are directed anteriorly (invariably posteriorly in Colpoda) and (ii) the
colpodid, left lateral postoral sac is modified to a posterior plug (uvula) distinctly set off from
body proper. The latter difference is not distinct, but evident on comparison of figures.
Comparison with related species: We split Maryna namibiensis into two
subspecies distinctly differing in some features (Table 183), especially by the shape of the
macronucleus, which is considered as relevant at species level (DINGFELDER 1962, FOISSNER
1993c). Thus, subspecies level is probably too conservative. On the other hand, the overall
appearance of the Namibian and the Costa Rican population is so similar that species rank
appears unjustified.
934

There is only one species which resembles M. namibiensis, namely M. galeata GELEI, 1950b
(see FOISSNER 1993c for a detailed review of all Maryna species). However, both differ in
several features (Fig. 201a, n; 421a-v, 424p-s by M. namibiensis costaricensis): body shape
(broadly pyriform with long uvula vs. helmet-shaped with short uvula), size (length usually <
150 urn vs. > 150 urn), location of the oral apparatus (oral opening underneath mid-body vs.
near posterior body end), case (absent vs. present, in both species checked in cultures), and
number of micronuclei (two or more vs. one). The last feature is of special interest and a main
species character because all other Maryna species have only one micronucleus. The same
situation occurs in the closely related genus Colpoda, where only few species are
multimicronucleate (FOISSNER 1993c). Very likely, there are further differences because M.
galeata has not yet been investigated with modern methods. For instance, behaviour is unique
in M. namibiensis because most other Maryna species are restless, fast swimmers, at least
when out of case.
Maryna namibiensis namibiensis nov. sspec. (Fig. 201a-q; 294-297, 421a-z,
422a-k, o-z, 423a-g; Tables 182, 183)
Diagnosis: Size 80-130 x 65-105 urn in vivo. Macronucleus globular. On average 62
somatic ciliary rows and 30 kineties in left oral polykinetid.
Type location: Rock-pool of a brook in the Daan Viljoen Game Park near Windhoek,
Namibia, 22°35'S 17°05'E (site 73 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Although the species could be cultivated for some time (see ecology
section), all observations, if not otherwise stated, are from specimens obtained from a non-
flooded Petri dish culture. Furthermore, some observations from the population of site (29)
are included because conspecificity is beyond doubt (Table 182).
Size in vivo and preparations 80-130 x 65-105 um, usually about 105 x 90 |im, uvula about
half as wide as calix; length:width ratio little variable, that is, 1.1-1.4:1, usually between 1.2-
1.3:1 (Table 182). Shape likewise fairly constant, that is, broadly pyriform or dumb-bell-like;
cells basically composed of a large anterior globule (calix) and a small posterior globule
(uvula) both more or less distinctly flattened and even slightly concave ventrally and
separated from each other by a conspicuous postoral (diagonal) groove gradually deepening
from ventral to dorsal side. This produces two main aspects of M. namibiensis namibiensis
(Fig. 201k-m; 421a-u, 422f, v): (i) it is dumb-bell-shaped when viewed ventrally and
dorsally because the full depth of the postoral groove is recognizable, and (ii) it is roughly
pyriform when viewed laterally because of the flattened ventral and vaulted dorsal side. Calix
usually globular, rarely indistinctly pyramidal (Fig. 421 1), never helmet-like. Uvula con-
spicuous, more or less distinctly spheroidal. Rarely occur specimens flattened dorsally (Fig.
42 lz). In declining pure cultures, fast-swimming, cylindroidal specimens occur.
Macronucleus in middle body third, usually near body centre, more pre-equatorial in
population from site (29) than from site 73 (Table 182), spherical to slightly ellipsoidal
(1.1:1), with distinct membrane and reticular nucleolus. Usually two micronuclei attached to
935

macronucleus at variable positions, in vivo about 5 urn across and with distinct membrane,
compact and thus easy to recognize (Fig. 201a, h, o; 42 lv, w, 422r). Contractile vacuole in
posterior body end with single excretory pore in centre of uvula surface, associated with
many narrow collecting canals extending to mid-body (Fig. 201a, g, h, p; 421a, c). Cortex
flexible and comparatively inconspicuous because without extrusomes (checked in many
specimens and with various stains because uncommon in such a large species!), contains
numerous type I crystals (see below) and minute granules (< 0.5 urn, mucocysts?) around
ciliary bases (Fig. 20Id; 42ly). Cytoplasm colourless, specimens however dark at low
magnification in posterior portion due to the refractive crystals contained, shows strong
cyclosis preorally; contains three main inclusions: (i) innumerable, minute (0.5-1.5 urn),
yellowish type I crystals conspicuously sparkling under interference contrast illumination
(Fig. 201b, d; 42ly); (ii) many medium-sized (3-4 urn), ellipsoidal to cylindroidal type II
crystals, partially in small vacuoles (Fig. 201c; 423a, f); and (iii) many food vacuoles, which
contain exclusively bacteria and are conspicuously small (4-6 urn across) compared to size of
cell (Fig. 201a; 42lw). Type I crystals scattered in cortex and cytoplasm, type II crystals con-

centrated in uvula, food vacuoles mainly in calix; some (parasitic?) bacterial rods lie freely in
the cytoplasm. Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis, does not build a case
as obvious in pure cultures, where specimens slowly circle on the bottom of the dish or swim
in the medium; likewise, although abundant, no cases were observed in the non-flooded Petri
dish culture. Maryna namibiensis namibiensis shows a distinct tendency to adhere with the
anterior pole region on debris and the microscope slide, remaining almost immobile for some
time; thus, it is easily photographed, even upside-down, that is, when standing on the calix
(Fig. 421a-o); if debris is lacking two or more specimens adhere anteriorly (Fig. 42 lx).
Cilia about 12 urn long in vivo, sprout from deep, broadly elliptical pits; usually paired,
except above uvula and on posterior uvula surface, where kinetids with barren anterior basal
body occur (Fig. 422a, b). Elongated caudal cilia lacking, terminal uvula surface, however,
studded with scattered cilia from posterior end of ordinary somatic ciliary rows (Fig. 201a, h,
p; 294, 421s, 422u). All ciliary rows, except those on right half of ventral side, subterminally
condensed producing the heavily ciliated diagonal (postoral) groove. Most ciliary rows abut
on a ventral suture, except for 6-8 (usually 7, n = 10) postoral rows (Fig. 20 li, n, q; 422d-g,
o-q, w). Preoral suture conspicuous, especially in silver nitrate preparations, commences at
upper mouth margin and extends straight to anterior pole centre. Postoral suture also distinct
because in a "stripe contrast" zone, that is, the region where the loosely ciliated rows right of
the suture obliquely abut on the densely ciliated postoral rows.
The cilia and the silverlines connecting their basal bodies form a highly ordered pattern,
whose spiral course causes many aspects, depending on the angle viewed (Fig. 20 lh, n-q;
421p-s, 422f-h, o-v). However, the pattern is obviously as in other members of the genus and
homologous with the Colpoda pattern, which is well recognizable in this large species.
Basically, the ciliary rows perform a spiral course more pronounced left than right of the
preoral suture. The rows commencing left of the preoral suture extend obliquely (~ 45°)
above the ventral and dorsal surface, those of the upper third course sigmoidally onto the
posterior right lateral and ventral surface. Right of the preoral suture are about seven
shortened, only slightly curved rows, most of which abut on the right margin of the oral
apparatus. They are followed by about 15 slightly sigmoidal rows, some of which abut on the
postoral kineties, while the others extend onto the uvula filling the ventrolateral space left by
the left side ciliary rows. Postoral ciliary rows rather conspicuous, indistinctly separated from
left side rows; first row, on which some right side kineties abut, often more loosely ciliated
than the other rows.
Oral opening farther subterminal than in other members of genus due to the long uvula (Table
182). Vestibulum about 25 urn deep in vivo, conical with flattened bottom, extends slightly
obliquely anteriad; upper and right margin of oral overture distinct, left merges into diagonal
(postoral) groove (Fig. 201a, n; 295, 421a, f, k, p, z, 422y, z). Left oral polykinetid on
flattened vestibular bottom, plug-shaped because composed of an average of 30
monokinetidal ciliary rows decreasing gradually in length distally and especially proximally;
cilia about 5 urn long, form distinct plates (Fig. 422z). Two thick fibre bundles, not described
in any other member of the order, originate from base of left polykinetid and obliquely extend
into the cell (Fig. 20li). Right oral polykinetid on vestibular roof, crescentic, composed of a
proximal row of dikinetids and irregular, curved rows of monokinetids, extends to distal
mouth margin, which thus appears densely ciliated (Fig. 295, 422y, z); no vestibular kineties.
Pharyngeal fibres inconspicuous, extend anteriorly (Fig. 201a, i, j; 422f, g, o, s, t, w-z).

76 um (Table 182), dark-brown at low magnification (< x 100), colourless at higher magnifi-
cation. About one third of cysts contained two specimens, possibly cells which transformed
into resting cysts during division. Endocyst smooth and colourless, 2-3 urn thick and very
flexible, covered by an about 5 (im thick, rough ectocyst obviously composed of excreted
material, viz., cytoplasmic type II crystals and food residues glued together by a very viscous
material becoming membrane-like wrinkled in squashed cysts. Cytoplasm packed with
minute granules, type I crystals, and small fat globules; the macronucleus stands out as dark
globule because covered by an about 1 urn thick layer of cytoplasmic type I crystals, as in M.
umbrellata (Fig. 20 le; 423a-g).
The resting cysts of M. namibiensis namibiensis lack the yellowish globules composing the
ectocyst of —» M. umbrellata. Thus, they are more similar to those of M. atra, which,
however, have a thicker (7 urn) endocyst (FOISSNER 1993C).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in Namibia, viz., in mud from rock-
pools at sites (29) and (73). Such ephemeric habitats are generally preferred by marynids
(FOISSNER 1993c). However, M. namibiensis is possibly restricted, or least prefers, river rock-
pools because both subspecies were found as yet only in such habitats. We could cultivate M.
namibiensis namibiensis in Eau de Volvic enriched with some salad medium, two unsquashed
wheat grains, and backer's yeast as food source. All cultures, however, encysted after a few
divisions.
Comparison with related species (see also comparison of species above): Maryna
namibiensis namibiensis differs from M. namibiensis costaricensis mainly by the features
compiled in table 183, especially in the shape and size of the macronucleus. Furthermore, the
numbers of somatic ciliary rows and kineties in the left oral polykinetid do not overlap.

Maryna namibiensis costaricensis nov. sspec. (Fig. 202a -h; 424a-y, 425a-m;
Tables 183, 184)
Diagnosis: Size 110-160 x 70-130 um, usually 140 x 105 um in vivo. Macronucleus
broadly ellipsoidal. On average 80 somatic ciliary rows and 43 kineties in left oral polykinetid.
Type location: Rock-pools at bank of Rio Corobici in the surroundings of the hacienda
"La Pacifica" (Centro Ecolögico "La Pacifica") near the town of Carlas in Costa Rica, Central
America, 10°28'N 85° 10'W.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description and comparison with related species: This subspecies is very
similar to M. namibiensis namibiensis in general morphology and behaviour. Thus, we do not
provide a separate description, but emphasize the differences given in the diagnosis. Further-
more, we refer to the detailed morphometrics (Tables 183, 184), figures, and figure explana-
tions. Resting cysts were not observed.
Generally, M. namibiensis costaricensis is distinctly larger than M. namibiensis namibiensis
and thus appears more massive. Accordingly, most morphometrics do not or only slightly
overlap (Table 183). Maryna namibiensis costaricensis feeds not only on bacteria, which are
digested in 6-10 um-sized vacuoles, but also on large, heterotrophic euglenids.

Neotype material: Neotypified from Costa Rican population, according to reasons 1, 4,
6 given in chapter 2.4.2.
Improved diagnosis: Size around 100 urn in vivo, slightly broader than long.
Distinctly mushroom-shaped, that is, with umbrella-like calix and button-shaped, minute
uvula. Macronucleus globular. Extrusomes rod-shaped, form rather conspicuous fringe.
About 50 somatic ciliary rows and 20 kineties in left oral polykinetid.
Description of Costa Rican neotype population: Overall size 80-110 urn in
vivo (70-120 urn in Australian specimens and 70-90 |im in Namibian site 66 specimens).
General appearance like a mushroom with a very short trunk (Fig. 203a); disc-shaped
specimens occurred in Australia (Fig. 203b). Calix (cap) conical to broadly conical, that is,
usually slightly broader than long (high) and inconspicuously flattened ventrally; transverse
view thus broadly elliptical with a more or less distinct ventral groove marking preoral suture.
Uvula (trunk) set off from body proper by comparatively flat diagonal (postoral) groove,
broad but very short and thus inconspicuous, discoidal except for flattened portion right of
oral opening (Fig. 203a, h, i; 426a, c-f, r, s, x, y; Table 185). Nuclear apparatus dorsal of
body centre. Macronucleus globular, with reticular nucleolus and 1 um thick membrane
becoming very distinct in stained specimens, when the nuclear material shrinks (nuclear
membrane also conspicuous in a South African population, but less so in Australian speci-
mens). Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, about 3 (im across and surrounded by distinct
membrane (Fig. 203a, i; 426g-i, k). Contractile vacuole in uvula, with inconspicuous
collecting canals and single excretory pore in centre of uvula surface (Fig. 203a, k; 426e, f, t,
y, z). Cortex very flexible, punctated by deep ciliary pits and, in optical section, rather
distinctly striated by the extrusomes. Ciliary pits occasionally stand out as white circles from
yellowish impregnated cortex in protargoL slides, filled with silver precipitation and sur-
rounded by a circular to slightly irregular silverline in silver nitrate preparations (Fig. 203 1,
m; 426b, 427b-d). Extrusomes of very similar arrangement (in narrow stripes within ciliary
rows), shape (rod-like), and size (about 4 x 0.2 urn) in Namibian, Costa Rican, Australian,
and Venezuelan specimens; produce rather distinct fringe, individual extrusomes, however,
difficult to recognize due to their slenderness; become extruded and stain pink, but elongate
only slightly when methyl green-pyronin is added (Fig. 203a, c, d; 426a, m). Subcortical
mitochondria conspicuously large, ellipsoidal (Fig. 203c). Cytoplasm viscid and packed with
various inclusions, viz., innumerable minute crystals, some large crystals, few to rather many
dark-brown flakes, and usually many food vacuoles containing bacterial residues. Cells thus
opaque and brownish at low magnification (< xlOO). Minute crystals (< 1 urn) conspicuously

anterior pole. The postoral suture (arrow in Fig. 203h) is minute but distinct because it is at a "stripe contrast" zone, where
the densely ciliated diagonal groove abuts on the loosely ciliated ventral kineties. h, i: Ventral and dorsal view. Arrow marks

sparkling under interference contrast illumination and dark in transmitted light, often
concentrated in uvula, in a subapical spot in calix, and underneath cortex (Fig. 203a; 426a, j,
1); even more numerous in Australian specimens often making black anterior body third. Up
to 5 urn long, ellipsoidal, colourless crystals and dark-brown flakes of unknown nature
scattered throughout cells, crystals concentrated around contractile vacuole. Food vacuoles 4—
7 urn across, rarely up to 30 urn, Namibian site (66) and Australian specimens packed with 3-
5 um-sized food vacuoles and some almost empty vacuoles up to 20 urn across (Fig. 203a, c).
Swims fast to very fast performing a characteristic spiral, rocking course; never rests. No
dwelling tubes were observed, even not in pure cultures from an Australian population.
Somatic and oral ciliary pattern as in congeners (FoiSSNER 1993c). However, it will be
described in some detail because of several specializations and new observations. Cilia sprout
from deep, elliptical pits and are usually paired, except above uvula and on posterior uvula
surface, where the anterior basal body is barren (Fig. 426d, q). Elongated caudal cilia lacking,
posterior uvula surface, however, contains scattered cilia originating from posterior end of
kineties (Fig. 203a, g, k; 426e, f, p, t, w, y, z). All ciliary rows, except about ten rows right of
oral apparatus, have a condensed subterminal portion producing the heavily ciliated diagonal
(postoral) groove. Most ciliary rows abut on a ventral suture (Fig. 203h, j, k; 427a-h). Preoral
suture conspicuous, especially in silver nitrate preparations, extends slightly obliquely from
right buccal vertex to anterior pole, where it performs a sharp right-turn and widens. Postoral
suture, although being minute due to the flat uvula, also distinct because in a "stripe contrast"
zone, that is, the region where the loosely ciliated rows right of the suture abut on the densely
ciliated postoral kineties, which extend into the postoral groove.
The cilia and the silverlines connecting their basal bodies form a highly ordered pattern,
whose spiral course causes many aspects of the pattern, depending on the angle viewed (Fig.
203h-k; 426u-y, 427b-h). However, the pattern is obviously as in other members of the
genus (FoiSSNER 1985, 1993c). Briefly, the about 50 ciliary rows extend spirally backward,
especially from the left side of the preoral suture, and spiral across the dorsal side to extend
again onto the ventral side right of the oral apparatus, where they merge, on the flattened
portion of the uvula, into the almost straight ventral kineties. The left suture kineties above
the oral apparatus are about twice as widely spaced anteriorly than posteriorly and those in
the anterior half of the cell.
Oral apparatus between calix and uvula, minute compared to size of cell (Table 185).
Vestibulum conical, extends anteriorly; right margin of oral overture distinct, left merges into
diagonal groove (Fig. 203a, f, g; 426c, e, f, 427j). Left oral polykinetid on bottom of
vestibulum, composed of an average of 21 monokinetidal rows decreasing gradually in length
proximally at right side and distally at both sides. Right oral polykinetid on vestibular roof,
cuneate, composed of a proximal row of dikinetids and of slightly irregular, oblique rows of
monokinetids (Fig. 203n; 426u, 427i-o).
Silverline system in Colpoda pattern. Meshes narrow and irregular in preoral suture and
posterior pole area (Fig. 203h-m; 426z, 427b-d).
Division and resting cysts were observed in cultures from an Australian population. Repro-
duction generates up to four tomites and occurs in a cyst covered by a thin membrane. The
infraciliature is reorganized (Fig. 427p-s). Resting cysts have an average diameter of 64 urn
(Table 185) and are blackish at low magnification (< xlOO; Fig. 427t) and yellowish at higher
magnification (> x250; Fig. 427w). Rarely, resting cysts with dividing cells were observed,
948

possibly specimens which transformed into resting cysts during division. Endocyst smooth,
only about 1 urn thick and colourless, covered by an about 4 urn thick, conspicuous layer
(ectocyst) of yellowish, fatty shining globules, which, like the cyst membrane, stain blue with
methyl green-pyronin (Fig. 203e; 427u-y). Globules 1-6 jam across and structureless in the
light and scanning electron microscope (Fig. 427u, v, z), remain on cyst wall when inhabitant
excysted. Cyst surrounded by rather voluminous, very hyaline mucous envelope usually
colonized by bacteria and lost when transferred from culture dish to microscope slide (Fig.
427t). Nuclear apparatus stands out from colourless cytoplasm as a conspicuous, brownish
globule because covered by the minute, sparkling crystals described above (Fig. 203e; 427w,
x). Cytoplasm granular, contains few to many 1-3 um-sized fat globules, making cysts dark
and opaque at low magnification .

The resting cyst of M. umbrellata is distinctly different from those of M. galeata, M. atra, and
M. namibiensis, but highly resembles that of Mycterothrix tuamotensis (for review, see
FoiSSNER 1993c). However, we did not observe an equatorial thickening.
Occurrence and ecology: Literature data (FoiSSNER 1993c) and the present
observations show that M. umbrellata is not a typical soil ciliate but prefers ephemeral
puddles. However, in Namibia it was found in ordinary but highly saline soil samples (sites
66, 70), which agrees with the type location, that is, soda puddles (sziliszek) in Hungary; in
Costa Rica (Central America), M. umbrellata occurred in the mud of deep, cylindroidal rock-
pools at the bank of the Rio Corobici at the hacienda "La Pacifica" (Centro Ecolögia "La
Pacifica") near the town of Canas, 10°28'N 85°10'W); in Australia, we isolated it from the
dark mud (pH 7.0) of rock-pools at the bank of the Shoalhaven River near the town of
Bungonia (35°S 149°E); in Venezuela, M. umbrellata occurred in rock-pools (Lajas) near the
airport of Puerto Ayacucho. We could cultivate the Australian population for two weeks in
Eau de Volvic enriched with some cracked wheat grains. Cultures then declined and encysted.
Some air-dried cysts could be reactivated after two months, but the specimens did not
reproduce. As yet, M. umbrellata was known only from Europe. Our data show that it is a
cosmopolitan, euryhaline ciliate preferring ephemeral puddles.
Comparison with literature and related species: Our observations agree
well with the original description and the redescription by DINGFELDER (1962). All popula-
tions are very similar and easily identified by the mushroom-like shape, the size (around 100
urn), the globular macronucleus, the extrusome fringe (described as "thick cortex" by GELEI),
and the lack of elongated caudal cilia. Accordingly, identification is beyond reasonable doubt.
However, neotypification is necessary because the original description does not unequivo-
cally define M. umbrellata, which is easily confused or even identical to M. cardioides
(macronucleus ellipsoidal) and M. pinguis (almost globular), two poorly described species
reviewed in FOISSNER (1993c).
Ilsiella elegans nov. spec. (Fig. 204a-p; 428j, k; Table 186)
Diagnosis: Size about 35 x 20 urn in vivo. Fusiform with conspicuous subterminal
indentation at oral opening. Macronucleus globular. 10 somatic ciliary rows, five of which
distinctly condensed above and left of oral apparatus. Right oral ciliary field composed of an
average of 10 dikinetids, left elongate rectangular consisting of 9 ciliary rows.
Type location: Bark of a Colophospermum mopane tree at the Bambatsi Guest Farm,
Namibia, 20°10'S 15°25'E (site 51 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective elegans refers to the elegant shape of this species.
Description: Size 25-40 x 18-25 urn in vivo, usually about 35 x 20 urn. Shape highly
characteristic and very similar in the three populations studied (Fig. 204a, d-g; 428k):
fusiform (2:1) to elongate fusiform (3:1) with distinct subterminal indentation at oral opening;
slenderest specimens slightly sigmoidal and looking very elegant (Fig. 204d). Unflattened and
non-contractile. Location of nuclear apparatus highly variable, on average slightly below mid-

apparatus. DF - dense ciliary field, LP - left oral polykinetid, MA - macronucleus, RP -

body. Macronucleus spherical to slightly ellipsoidal (6x5 um), with many small nucleoli.
Micronucleus attached to macronucleus, about 2 urn across, impregnates only faintly with
protargol. Cortex colourless, flexible, thin; extrusomes recognizable neither in vivo nor in
protargol preparations. Cytoplasm with many minute (< 1 urn) crystals sparkling under
interference contrast illumination, especially in posterior body third; and up to 5 urn long
bacterial rods, possibly parasites or symbionts. Cells usually packed with 3-5 um-sized food
vacuoles containing bacteria. Swims rather rapidly in narrow spirals rotating about main body
axis, but also attaches to soil particles with the anterior body end (Fig. 428k).
Organization of somatic ciliary pattern similar to that of Maryna antarctica FOISSNER, 1993c
and rather simple because of lacking diagonal groove and caudal cilia. Row pattern, on the
other hand, difficult to follow because of sparse ciliation and broad, triangular, unciliated
preoral area (Fig. 204a-c, h-p; Table 186). Invariably 10 kineties: right of preoral area and on
dorsal surface five loosely ciliated (6-11 dikinetids/row), bipolar kineties, whose oblique
952

orientation gradually increases from ventral to dorsal side; left lateral rows 6 and 7 posteriorly
continue as short preoral kineties; preoral kineties 8-10 strongly shortened and obliquely
arranged above and left of oral apparatus, composed of closely spaced dikinetids producing
rather distinct ciliary tuft left of oral opening. First preoral kinety (kinety 10 in Fig. 204m)
composed of 5-6 dikinetids, with rightmost two kinetids not obliquely but transversely
orientated, as in M. antarctica; second preoral kinety composed of 7-11 dikinetids; third of
9-10; fourth of 7-8; and fifth of 4-5 dikinetids. Some scattered dikinetids postorally, possibly
remnants of mycteral (postoral groove) kineties.
Oral opening at base of subterminal body indentation, that is, right oral ciliary field 30% back
from rear body end on average (Fig. 204a, b, h, i, m-o; Table 186). Vestibulum small,
conical, with fine pharyngeal fibres extending anteriorly and impregnating only occasionally.
Left oral ciliary field (polykinetid) on (dorsal) vestibular bottom, elongate rectangular,
consists of an average of nine kineties each composed of five basal bodies having 4 urn long
cilia; kineties at ends of field with three to four cilia only. Right oral ciliary field extends
along upper vestibular entrance, composed of an average of 10 dikinetids forming a slightly
curved row, as is typical for Ilsiella.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found in three contrasting terrestrial habitats
which, however, agree in their extremely ephemeric nature: Colophospermum bark in
Namibia (type location), soil from the Murray River floodplain in Australia, and leaf litter from

a beech forest in Salzburg, Austria. The species is moderately abundant at all sites and of very
similar morphology: for instance, the left oral polykinetid is composed of about ten kineties in
both the African and Australian population. The ephemeric nature of/, elegans is emphasized
by the observation that it is present only during the first days after rewetting the samples, and
in Salzburg it occurs only in the fresh, rain-wet litter. Thus, it is likely that the species is more
common than indicated by the few records, as we usually investigate only air-dried, rewetted
samples. Obviously, /. elegans is a cosmopolitan preferring extremely ephemeric habitats.
Comparison with related species: Ilsiella elegans has a highly characteristic
shape distinctly different from that of the two congeners, which are globular (FoiSSNER
1993c). First, we identified our populations as Maryna acuminata (GELLERT, 1955)
FOISSNER, 1993c, which has a similar shape. Unfortunately, GELLERT (1955) illustrated only a
single, mercuric chloride and opal blue-prepared cell, although he studied live specimens, as
evident from the text. According to GELLERT (1955), M. acuminata is only 20-25 urn long,
leaf-like flattened ("a leaf-shaped organism pointed at both ends"), and has four ciliary rows
with widely and equidistantly spaced, paired cilia (Fig. 204q). Although the number of ciliary
rows is subject to different interpretations in marynids, the conspicuous field of ventrolateral
ciliary rows of /. elegans is not, because it is easily recognizable both in vivo and prepara-
tions. Thus, our species cannot be classified with M. acuminata. Whether M. acuminata
belongs to Maryna or Ilsiella needs reinvestigation of silvered specimens.
At first glance, the condensed ciliary rows of/, elegans look like ordinary mycteral (postoral
groove) kineties. However, they are above the oral apparatus and thus must be ventrolateral
ciliary rows, as in other marynids, where they are less conspicuous because the other kineties
are also densely ciliated. There is a line of transitions from very distinct (/. elegans) to
distinct (/. palustris, I. terricola, Maryna antarctica) through indistinct (-» M. umbrellatd) to
absent (—» M. namibiensis). Thus, the feature hardly can be used to split the genus at the
present state of knowledge.
Nivaliellaplana FoiSSNER, 1980 (Fig. 205a-g; 428a-i; Table 187)
Nivaliella plana, as described by FOISSNER (1980b) and reviewed in FoiSSNER (1993c), is a
minute (10-25 x 6-20 urn in vivo), flattened ciliate with a somewhat quadrangular outline.
Over the years, we found it in hundreds of soil samples from all continents (FOISSNER 1998a).
The populations formed two groups, viz., one with a smooth surface (cortex), as stated in the
original description, and another with a ribbed appearance. Often, both types occurred in the
same sample and were connected by more or less distinct transitions. Thus, we studied in
detail a North American population, in which the ridges were especially prominent. This
showed that the ciliary pattern is as in the Australian N. plana population described in
FOISSNER (1993c). Accordingly, the ribbed specimens/populations are very likely ecovariants
of N. plana. However, a detailed description of this variety is warranted because it looks
rather different from the smooth variety and is thus easily mistaken for a distinct species.
Furthermore, some specimens are often difficult to distinguish from small individuals of
Pseudoplatyophrya nana and P. saltans.
954

The ribbed population described now is from a coastal grassland with halophytes south of San
Francisco, USA. The sample was a mixture of fine roots and slightly saline, acidic (pH 5.5)
rhizosphere soil.
Size 18-27 x 10-15 urn, usually about 20 x 13 urn, that is, slightly larger than the smooth
variety. Shape highly variable, often as shown in figures 205a, b, that is, bursiform or ovate
like a small, fat Pseudoplatyophrya nana or P. salterns, occasionally broader and more
distinctly quadrangular looking, like the smooth variety, or more slender resembling an
ordinary P. nana; slightly to up 2:1 flattened laterally. Nuclear apparatus near body centre.
Macronucleus globular, hyaline with very pale nucleoli. Micronucleus conspicuous in vivo
because compact and about 3 x 1 urn in size, attached to macronucleus, discoidal; ellipsoidal
in protargol preparations. Contractile vacuole in posterior body end, excretory pore not seen.

955

Cortex bright, rigid, and more or less distinctly ribbed along ciliary rows; ribbing usually well
recognizable at a magnification of > xlOO, even if well-fed. Extrusomes hardly recognizable
in vivo; however, the dikinetids are surrounded by minute granules, very likely some sort of
mucocysts, in protargol preparations, providing the specimens with a characteristic appear-
ance (Fig. 205d; 428f, i). Cytoplasm usually rather hyaline, contains some 0.5-3 um-sized fat
globules and many minute (~ 0.2 urn) crystals sparkling under interference contrast illumina-
tion. Glides quickly on microscope slide and soil particles.
Somatic cilia paired and about 8 urn long in vivo, that is, large compared to size of cell. A
distinctly elongated caudal cilium, accompanied by an ordinary cilium, on ventral posterior
end of cell. Arrangement of cilia very similar as described by FOISSNER (1993c). Briefly,
there are 30 dikinetids on average invariably forming ten ciliary rows, which are distinctly
shortened posteriorly, except for rows 2 and 6; thus, the central portion of the right and left
side lacks cilia. The first dikinetid of row 10, not mentioned in FOISSNER (1993c), is difficult
to recognize because it is close to the paroral membrane (Fig. 205a, b, e-g); see table 187 for
numbers of dikinetids in individual kineties.Oral apparatus subapical on ventral side of cell,
as minute as in most other members of order, details thus difficult to recognize. Feeding tube
about 2 urn long in vivo. Cilia of paroral membrane and adoral organelle(s) each about 3 urn
long in vivo, form rigid bundles. Adoral organelle(s) likely composed of six basal bodies,
associated with long pharyngeal fibres (Fig. 205a, e, f).

Parabryophrya etoschensis nov. spec. (Fig. 206a-d; Table 188)
Diagnosis: Size about 110 x 30 urn; reniform. Macronucleus ellipsoidal. Food vacuoles
elongate ellipsoidal, near 10 x 4 urn. About 25 ciliary rows. Two adoral organelles, proximal
end of right oral ciliary field broadly rounded.
Type location: Soil from the ghost tree forest (Moringa ovalifolia) in the Etosha
National Park, Namibia, 19°S 15°40'E (site 56 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the region discovered.
Description: Size 100-130 x 25-35 urn in vivo, usually about 110 x 30 urn, length:width
ratio moderately variable, on average 3.5:1 (Table 188). Shape reniform in ventral and lateral
view because more or less distinctly concave postorally, anterior end more narrowly rounded
than posterior (Fig 206a, b); unflattened. Macronucleus in or near body centre, broadly
ellipsoidal to almost semicircular, on average 26 x 13 urn. Micronucleus, possibly two in
some specimens, in indentation of macronucleus, ellipsoidal. Contractile vacuole in posterior
body end, with two collecting canals extending anteriorly and an excretory pore in centre of
posterior pole. Cortex distinctly furrowed by ciliary rows in anterior body third, contains
many bright granules (extrusomes?), which do not impregnate with the protargol method
used. Cytoplasm colourless, usually contains a dozen, 8—12 x 3-6 urn-sized food vacuoles
with remarkably regularly packed bacteria; when bacteria break during digestion, vacuoles
round up (Fig. 206a). Swims rather rapidly by rotation about main body axis.
Cilia paired, closely spaced anteriorly, arranged in about 20-30 strongly spiralling rows
commencing left of oral opening and preorally along a narrow suture (Fig. 206b, c; Table
188). Oral apparatus subapical in anterior 20% of cell, auricular with conspicuous, semi-
circular right ciliary field composed of many short, radial rows and two inconspicuous adoral
organelles at left mouth margin; anterior adoral organelle composed of 10-20 scattered basal
bodies, posterior of about four dikinetids likely at strongly curved anterior end of a postoral
kinety. Anterior portion of right ciliary field narrowed or even pointed and merging into
somatic kineties, posterior end broad, forming conspicuous ciliary patch when viewed
ventrolaterally (Fig. 206a, b, d; Table 188).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location. The species was very
rare in the non-flooded Petri dish culture and did not occur in two samples taken from the
same area in the year 2001.
Comparison with related species: Parabryophrya etoschensis differs from P.
penardi (KAHL, 1931b), the sole congener reviewed in FOISSNER (1993c), by the
macronucleus (ellipsoidal vs. globular), the food vacuoles (narrowly vs. broadly ellipsoidal),
the number of ciliary rows (about 25 vs. < 20), the number of adoral organelles (two vs. one),
and the shape of the right oral ciliary field (proximal end broad vs. bluntly pointed; thus the
field is auricular in P. etoschensis and crescentic in P. penardi). Certainly, these differences,
especially in the oral structures, are sufficient to classify the Namibian population as a new
species. However, the genus and the variability of the species are poorly known, but we have
at least two further undescribed species in our notebook.

Platyophrya spumacola KAHL, 1927
We split this species into two subspecies according to distinct differences in the number of
adoral organelles. The following diagnosis is based on the revision of FOISSNER (1993C).
Improved diagnosis: Average size about 70-100 x 30-40 urn in vivo. Usually slightly
reniform and 20-30 somatic ciliary rows with about 50 dikinetids in a right lateral kinety and
40 in a left lateral. Oral apparatus subapical on ventral side, 6-10 adoral organelles on
average. Prefers terrestrial habitats.
Platyophrya spumacola spumacola KAHL, 1927b nov. stat.
Diagnosis: Usually about 25 ciliary rows and 10 adoral organelles.
Locus classicus: Cicada foam attached to plants in Hamburg, Germany.
Remarks: See FOISSNER (1993c) for a detailed review on this subspecies.
959

Platyophrya spumacola hexasticha nov. sspec. (Fig. 207a-e; Table 189)
Diagnosis: On average 21 ciliary rows and 6 adoral organelles.
Type location: Soil from Aloe dichotoma forest near the Gariganus Guest Farm,
Namibia, 26°30'S 18°25'E (site 5 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Composite of the Greek words hexa (six) and sticha (row of things),
referring to the row of six adoral organelles.
Description: In vivo indistinguishable from P. spumacola spumacola. Thus, we refer the
reader to FOISSNER (1993C), who describes and illustrates the live aspect of P. spumacola in
detail. Briefly, cells have a size of 60-120 x 25-50 urn and are often slightly reniform due to
an indistinct ventral indentation. Macronucleus with distinct membrane. Micronucleus not
recognizable, likely in perinuclear space of macronucleus. Contractile vacuole distinctly
subterminal, with ventrolaterally located excretory pore at end of shortened kineties 6 and 7
or 7 and 8. Mucocysts numerous, bulbous, 1 \im across, and rather strongly impregnated,
often covering infraciliarure in protargol preparations (Fig. 207e). Cytoplasm with some
large, empty-appearing vacuoles and food vacuoles containing the heterotrophic flagellate
Polytomella.
Somatic ciliature as in P. spumacola spumacola (FOISSNER 1993c). Briefly, the slightly
spiralling ciliary rows are more closely spaced and ciliated on right than left side of cell and
form a rather distinct suture extending from the excretory pore over the posterior pole to the
subterminal dorsolateral surface; most left side dikinetids have ciliated only the posterior
basal body. Postoral pseudomembrane distinct, consists of about 25 basal body quadruplets
(Fig. 207a-c).
Oral apparatus basically as in P. spumacola spumacola (FOISSNER 1993c), but smaller and
thus less conspicuous (Fig. 207a, c, d, f). Oral area extends from anterior body end back on
ventral side, elliptical. Paroral membrane C-shaped, composed of about 20 dikinetids
associated with many fine fibres forming right half of pharyngeal basket; anterior portion of
fibres not impregnated causing blank stripe between paroral and right pharynx half. At left
mouth margin five to seven, usually six minute, brick-shaped, obliquely orientated adoral
organelles associated with thick, but short rods forming left half of pharyngeal basket. Oral
slit supported by fine fibres of unknown origin. Pharyngeal basket cylindroidal, extends to
mid-body, not bifurcated proximally, as in —» Platyophryid.es latus.
Occurrence and ecology: The type location is an extraordinary place, namely, a
small forest of the giant Liliaceae, Aloe dichotoma. Eleven new taxa were discovered in this
sample and several others in two further samples from neighbouring habitats, indicating that
this area is a local diversity centre (detailed discussion, see general part). Platyophrya
spumacola hexasticha occurs also at Namibian sites (43, 52, 54), and recently we found it in
forest soil from Austria, indicating a wide geographical range. Likely, we saw this species
also in other soil samples, but did not distinguish it from P. spumacola spumacola.
Comparison with related species: This population is difficult to assign because
its main features overlap with those of P. spumacola, P. sphagni, and P. vorax. The number
of ciliary rows and adoral organelles matches P. sphagni which, however, is a limnetic
960

species with symbiotic green algae; furthermore, it is distinctly smaller, viz., 60 x 25 urn vs.
90 x 35 um (FOISSNER 1993c, FOISSNER & KREUTZ 1996). Platyophrya vorax is even smaller
(usually 50 x 25 urn) than P. sphagni and has only 11 ciliary rows and four adoral organelles.
Thus, we classify the Namibian site (5) population as a subspecies of P. spumacola, differing
mainly by the lower number of adoral organelles (6 vs. 10). Interestingly, the slides contain
also a few ordinary P. spumacola with a size of about 100 x 40 urn, 32 ciliary rows, and 13
adoral organelles.

Plesiocaryon nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small, flattened, completely ciliated Cyrtolophosididae (?) with macronucleus
and micronucleus each in separate nuclear membrane. Silverline system colpodid. A short,
oblique kinety at anterior margin of buccal cavity.
Type species: Balantiophorus elongatus SCHEWIAKOFF, 1892.
962

Etymology: Composite of the Greek plesio (related) and the Latin noun caryon (nucleus),
referring to the plesiomorphic state of the nuclear apparatus. Neuter gender.
Comparison with related genera: The diagnosis is based on FOISSNER (1993c)
and DIAZ et al. (2000). Balantiophorus elongatus SCHEWIAKOFF, 1892 looks rather similar to
Cyrtolophosis mucicola STOKES, 1885 and was thus transferred to this genus by KAHL
(1931b); a decision accepted by all later authors (FOISSNER 1993c).
However, very recently DIAZ et al. (2000) performed a detailed study on C. elongata showing
by transmission electron microscopy that, contrary to C. mucicola, the micronucleus does not
reside in the perinuclear space of the macronucleus. This is a rather fundamental difference
because the macro-micronuclear complex is considered as the main apomorphy of the order
Cyrtolophosidida, although some exceptions are now known (FOISSNER 1993c, LYNN et al.
1999).
Certainly, the ordinary nuclear apparatus of C. elongata must be credited by at least genus
level. Accordingly, we combine Cyrtolophosis elongata with Plesiocaryon: P. elongatum
(SCHEWIAKOFF, 1892) nov. comb. We cannot even exclude that this species and other
"deviating" cyrtolophosidids belong to an entirely different group (Sorogenida?), which
convergently developed similar oral structures (see also —» Platyophryides).
Nomenclature: The type species of Balantiophorus SCHEWIAKOFF, 1889 is B. minutus
SCHEWIAKOFF, 1889, which, however, is a junior, subjective synonym of Cyrtolophosis
mucicola STOKES, 1885 (FOISSNER 1993C). Thus, Balantiophorus is not available, and B.
elongatus SCHEWIAKOFF, 1892 must be classified in a new genus, Plesiocaryon. See
FOISSNER (1993 c) for the literature cited.
Plesiocaryon elongatum (SCHEWIAKOFF, 1892) nov. comb.
Based on the investigations of DIAZ et al. (2000), we reinvestigated the preparations from
Kenya, used by FOISSNER (1993C; Fig. 218d, e) to illustrate the infraciliature. This showed
that FOISSNER over-interpreted his preparations. Very likely, the Kenyan population has
monokinetids, except for the oral region, quite similar as shown by DIAZ et al. (2000) and in
—> Plesiocaryon terricola. Actually, the infraciliature is as shown in the in vivo illustration
and-nrmicrograpri2181ofFQiSSNER( 1593c).
Plesiocaryon terricola nov. spec. (Fig. 208a-m; 412f-i; Table 190)
1993 Cyrtolophosis acuta KAHL, 1926 - FOISSNER, Colpodea, p. 543 (partim).
Diagnosis: Size about 85x9 urn in vivo; more or less distinctly vermiform. Contractile
vacuole subterminal. On average 10 loosely ciliated somatic kineties, 4 adoral organelles, and
9 paroral dikinetids.
963

Type location: Soil from the ghost tree forest (Moringa ovalifolia) in the Etosha
National Park, Namibia, 19°S 15°50'E (site 56 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin adjective terricola (living in soil) indicates that it is likely
confined to terrestrial habitats.
Description: Size 60-120 x 8-12 um in vivo, usually near 85 x 9 urn; length:width ratio
also highly variable, viz., 5-14:1, on average near 10:1 both in vivo and protargol
preparations (Table 190). More or less distinctly rod-shaped and curved ventrally when
swimming, while vermiform when creeping serpentinely on and between soil particles, both
ends gradually narrowed and rounded, never pointed; laterally flattened up to 2:1, especially
in oral area (Fig. 208a, e, f, k, m; 412f, g). Macronucleus near body centre on average,
broadly (1.5:1) to slenderly (3:1) ellipsoidal, very hyaline with few, pale nucleoli.
Micronucleus broadly to slenderly ellipsoidal, invariably attached to posterior end of
macronucleus, but not very tightly so that both are recognizable as separate structures.
Contractile vacuole distinctly subterminal, that is, excretory pore on right side about 10 urn
above body end (Fig. 208a, e, k, m; 412h). Cortex highly flexible, contains loose rows of
granules 0.5-1 urn across, likely some sort of mucocysts. Cytoplasm finely granulated,
contains some lipid droplets 0.5-2 urn across and up to 12 um-sized food vacuoles with
bacterial remnants. Swims and crawls rather rapidly showing great flexibility, usually
distinctly curved ventrally when swimming (Fig. 208a, f); never rests or build a dwelling-
tube. Division occurs in freely motile (non-encysted) condition.
Cilia in oral region about 7 urn, postorally only 5 urn long in vivo, arranged in an average of
10 equidistant rows very loosely ciliated throughout, that is, with average in vivo distances of
about 6 urn among individual kinetids (Fig. 208a, h-1; Table 190). Ciliary rows commence
postorally, except for three to four bipolar dorsolateral kineties; accompanied by a rather
distinct fibre at left. Cilia ventrally paired only in oral area, while dorsally up to mid-body
with kinetids so regularly spaced that short, oblique rows are formed (Fig. 208 1);
monokinetids occur on postoral ventral side and in posterior half of dorsal side, while
dikinetids with barren anterior basal body occur in the transition zone (Fig. 208a, j, k),
indicating that P. terricola has true monokinetids, which is unusual for colpodids (FOISSNER
1993c), but likely occurs also in P. elongatum (DIAZ et al. 2000).
Oral apparatus occupies ventral anterior 10 urn of cell, rounded triangular oral opening about
5x3 \im in vivo, and thus, very small compared to body length (Fig. 208a-c; 412f, g; Table
190). Vestibulum extends to cell's midline, making oral area thin and bright at low
magnification (Fig. 208e). Right half of vestibulum covered by a sigmoidal, hyaline lip
bearing four minute, oblique thickenings posteriorly, likely corresponding to the barren
monokinetids in the posterior half of the paroral membrane (Fig. 208b, i). Pharyngeal fibres
very fine and recognizable only after protargol impregnation, but a surprisingly large
pharynx, forming a tubular structure extending to mid-body, becomes recognizable in feeding
specimens (Fig. 208a, f). Left half of vestibulum occupied by four minute adoral organelles
increasing in size from anterior to posterior, each composed of two kineties bearing 3—4 urn
long cilia in vivo, except for anterior organelle likely consisting of only a single ciliary row in
most specimens. Along right margin of organelles a C-shaped fibre posteriorly extending into
ventral margin of vestibular entrance, while anteriorly possibly contacting two to four
granules (basal bodies? "oblique kinety" mentioned in genus diagnosis; see also FOISSNER
1993c) at margin of vestibulum (Fig. 208a, b, d, h-k). Paroral membrane comparatively large,

extends from anterior body end to vestibular vertex, consists of two parts: anterior portion
composed of an average of nine closely spaced, obliquely arranged dikinetids producing a
distinct, about 7 urn long ciliary tuft; posterior portion composed of an average of four widely
spaced, barren monokinetids appearing as minute thickenings in vivo (Fig. 208b, c, h-k;
Table 190).
Silverline pattern colpodid, that is, composed of rather wide and regular meshes produced by
short, transverse silverlines connecting the longitudinal silverlines extending among the
kinetids of a kinety (Fig. 208m; 412h, i).

Occurrence and ecology: Plesiocaryon terricola was discovered in a sample taken at
Namibian site (56) in January 2001. However, it was also observed in the sample taken in
1994, but misidentified as Cyrtolophosis acuta. Plesiocaryon terricola became numerous
three weeks after rewetting the sample and stayed for further three weeks, although the
culture was sampled twice for preparations. During this period, no other Cyrtolophosis or
Plesiocaryon species was present in the culture, at least, we could not find a single specimen
resembling C. acuta or P. elongatum in vivo and the silver preparations. Plesiocaryon
terricola is cosmopolitan because we have indisputable records from Austria (Fig. 219o in
FOISSNER 1993c) and soils globally. Indeed, most of our "Cyrtolophosis acuta" records are P.
966

terricola. We never found P. terricola in any of over 1000 freshwater samples investigated
during the past 30 years. Thus, this species must be confined to terrestrial habitats. This is
emphasized by the flexible and narrow body adapted for exploiting even very fine soil pores.
Generic classification and comparison with related species: The
micronucleus of this "Cyrtolophosis" is sometimes rather distant from the macronucleus and
thus very likely not in its perinuclear space, as is typical for Cyrtolophosis (FOISSNER 1993c).
Accordingly, we assign this species to Plesiocaryon, although indisputable evidences from
electron microscopical investigations are lacking.
We know P. terricola since the eighties, but mixed and/or misidentified it occasionally as
Cyrtolophosis acuta and/or C. elongata (FOISSNER 1980b, 1993c). This became evident from
an examination of the original notes. Indeed, these species are not easily to distinguish,
especially for the beginner FOISSNER was in 1980, because the original descriptions are rather
incomplete and good redescriptions were not available. Thus, FoiSSNER's (1980b, 1993c) data
on "Cyrtolophosis acuta" should be abandoned and investigation commence again, using
well-defined populations as described above.
Plesiocaryon terricola differs from Cyrtolophosis acuta in size (85 x 9 urn vs. 25 x 5 urn),
length:width ratio (10:1 vs. 5:1), body shape (vermiform vs. fusiform), and habitat (terrestrial
vs. limnetic). Unfortunately, possible further differences remain obscure because the original
description is meagre (KAHL 1926, 1931b) and the redescription doubtful (FOISSNER 1980b,
1993c). However, the differences in size, shape and habitat are so pronounced that
conspecificity is highly unlikely. Whether C. acuta is identical to P. elongatum, as supposed
by FOISSNER (1993a) and DIAZ et al. (2000), needs further investigation.
Plesiocaryon terricola differs also distinctly from P. elongatum by body size (60-120 x 8-12
urn, usually 85 x 9 uin vs. 15-25 x 5-15 urn, usually 25 x 10 urn), length:width ratio (10:1
vs. 2.5:1), body shape (vermiform vs. elongate ellipsoidal), location of contractile vacuole
(subterminal vs. terminal), and the number of ciliary rows (8-10 vs. 7-8).
We emphasize that there was not a single specimen resembling C. acuta or P. elongatum in
the abundant population from Namibian site (56), neither in vivo or silver preparations.
Ottowphrya nov. gen.
Before defining Ottowphrya, the senior author takes the opportunity to portray the interesting
events guiding to the discovery of this new genus, a long story indeed, which commenced in
1930 when KAHL described Platyophrya lata, differing from the "otherwise very similar P.
spumacola" by the projecting oral area and five to six cirri-like organelles along the left
mouth margin (Fig. 210a). It was only in 1979 that DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS
published details on the ciliary pattern of an organism they believed to be P. lata KAHL,
1930a (Fig. 209k-q). This well-done redescription hardly left doubts about the identification
and identity of the species because the specimens were of similar size and shape and
possessed six to eight rather conspicuous adoral organelles at the left mouth margin, that is,
"cirri" as emphasized by KAHL (1930a).
967

Later, FOISSNER (1987C) established a new species, P. dragescoi, for a ciliate differing from
P. lata by a lower number of adoral organelles (3-4 vs. 5-8) and somatic ciliary rows (19-22
vs. 28-37). He also recognized that ciliates of this type do not belong to Platyophrya because
of distinct differences in the shape and orientation of the adoral organelles. Accordingly,
FOISSNER (1987c) established the genus Platyophryides, with -> Platyophrya lata KAHL,
1930a as the type species. This rather unconventional decision was confirmed by an electron
microscopical investigation of the nuclear apparatus, which showed that, in contrast to the
other members of the order, the micronucleus is not in the perinuclear space of the
macronucleus (PUYTORAC et al. 1992). In 1993, when FOISSNER revised the class Colpodea,
he added a third species, P. magnus, and classified the investigation of P. lata by DRAGESCO
& DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1979) as an "authoritative redescription", that is, without any doubts
about the identification.
In the years following the revision of the class, I recognized that there are P. latus populations
with a body shape either more similar to that depicted by KAHL (1930a) or DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1979). However, differences were never so distinct that I got the
impression of two reliable taxa, not even after silver carbonate impregnation of a "Kahlian-
shaped" population (Fig. 430q-u), but I became increasingly confused about this species. This
encouraged me to prepare silver nitrate slides from various populations, and those from the
"Kahlian-shaped" specimens of Jordan and Venezuela were a great surprise: they showed
silverlines in Colpoda pattern, while all "Dragescoan-shaped" populations possessed a
Platyophrya pattern (FOISSNER 1993c).
Now it was clear that the two "shape variants" were not only different species, but even
different genera, and DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1979) and FOISSNER (1993c)
misidentified the Kahlian P. lata, which we shall redescribe in detail below.
Diagnosis: Moderately small, platyophryid Colpodea incertae sedis with silverlines in
Platyophrya pattern and conspicuous adoral organelles parallel to paroral membrane.
Type species: Platyophryides dragescoi FOISSNER, 1987c.
Dedication: Wilhelm FOISSNER dedicates this new genus to his friend and colleague,
Prof. Dr. J.C.G. OTTOW (Giessen University, Germany), on the occasion of his retirement.
Remarks: The ordinal classification of this kind of colpodid is open since PUYTORAC et al.
(1992) showed that they lack the main ordinal character, viz., a micronucleus within the
perinuclear space of the macronucleus. Although not proven by electron microscopy, silver
carbonate impregnation suggests that Ottowphrya dragescoi has the micronucleus also
outside the macronucleus (Fig. 429m). Thus, Platyophryides and Ottowphrya possibly belong
to the Sorogenida, as defined by FOISSNER (1993C), and should be checked for the ability to
aggregate and produce aerial sorocarps. Both differ from Sorogena mainly by the shape and
orientation of the adoral organelles and the inconspicuous oral dome. Furthermore,
Ottowphrya has silverlines in Platyophrya pattern.
The occurrence of an ordinary macro-micronucleus pattern in seemingly "typical" cyrto-
lophosidid colpodids, such as -> Plesiocaryon and —> Platyophryides, makes classification of
colpodids very difficult. When FOISSNER (1993c) suggested the conspicuous macro-
micronucleus complex of several colpodids as an ordinal character, most exceptions were not
known.

Synonymy: A reinvestigation of the Finnish population mentioned in FOISSNER (1993c)
and presented here in detail showed that Platyophrya lata, as described by DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1979), and Platyophryides dragescoi FOISSNER, 1987c are very likely
the same species. Many intermediate forms were found in this (Table 191) and some other
populations. However, none of these populations ever reached the giant —> P. magnus
FOISSNER, 1993c, which is thus very likely a reliable species. The following diagnosis
summarizes the previous data and the new observations described below.
Improved diagnosis: Size about 90 x 50 urn in vivo. Broadly bursiform with slightly
narrowed, ventrally curved oral portion. About 20—40 ciliary rows, depending on population.
Oral apparatus occupies conspicuously broad, anterior body end, consists of 3-8, usually 5-6
adoral organelles and an about 20-30 urn long paroral membrane comprising 35-70 kinetids,
depending on population.
Type material: Type slides of the German Platyophryides (now Ottowphrya) dragescoi
are deposited at the Biologiezentrum in Linz, Austria (FOISSNER 1987C). These specimens
have only three adoral organelles, while the Finnish population, of which we deposit voucher
slides at the same locality (Table 1), has three to seven, usually five organelles.
Description: The following description summarizes the data from DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1979) and FOISSNER (1987c), who studied mainly a German population
and mentioned observations from Austrian and Australian specimens. Furthermore, we
present detailed data from a Finnish population, already mentioned in FOISSNER (1993c), and
excellent scanning electron micrographs of specimens from Mount Kenya in Africa.
Size in vivo 80-120 urn (DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1979), 70-100 x 40-60 urn
(FOISSNER 1987^ and 60-110 x 30-65 urn in Finnish population; in silver preparations 45-
88 x-34-58-um (x: = 7-0-x 47 um;-DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1979), 63-91 x 27-45
urn (x = 76 x 38 urn; FOISSNER 1987c), and 59-101 x 31-64 ^m (x = 81 x 52 urn) in Finnish
population (Table 191); acontractile but highly flexible. Shape fairly variable, usually
distinctly bursiform with obliquely truncate, slightly narrowed oral portion projecting
ventrally; ventral contour thus sigmoidal, dorsal convex; posterior end invariable broadly
rounded with a more or less distinct subterminal indentation at site of contractile vacuole.
Laterally flattened up to 2:1, depending on nutrition state (Fig. 209a, d, e, g, k-o, 210q; 429i,
n-v). Nuclear apparatus slightly underneath mid-body on average. Macronucleus about 15
urn in vivo, slightly ellipsoidal, contains some medium-sized nucleoli. Micronucleus in small
indentation of macronucleus, possibly even in its perinuclear space (DRAGESCO &
DRAGESCO-KERNEIS 1979, FOISSNER 1987c; but see Fig. 429m). Contractile vacuole
subterminal with excretory pore at margin of ventral and right side. Cytopyge in small suture

underneath excretory pore, marked by a thick, roughly U-shaped silverline (Fig. 209u).
Cortex inconspicuous, slightly furrowed by ciliary rows, contains many 1-1.5 urn-sized
extrusomes surrounded by a silverline and forming a voluminous, slimy coat in encysting
specimens (Fig. 209j; 429j, k). Cytoplasm hyaline in oral portion, packed with food vacuoles
and up to 10 urn-sized fat globules in posterior two thirds. Feeds on small and medium-sized
colpodids and tetrahymenids ingested whole and slowly disintegrating in the food vacuoles.
Usually glides slowly on microscope slide and soil particles showing considerable flexibility.
Somatic ciliature composed of dikinetids, some of which, however, have ciliated only one
basal body with an about 8 urn long cilium. Number of ciliary rows highly variable: 19-22
(x = 21) in German type population (FoiSSNER 1987c); 21-30 (x = 24) in Finnish specimens
(Table 191); 33-37 in French and Australian specimens (DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS
1979; Fig. 429e); and 20-30 in Kenyan population. Ciliary rows basically bipolar and slightly
to distinctly spiralized, especially on right side, where some shortened rows form a minute
suture underneath the excretory pore of the contractile vacuole; more closely spaced and
denser ciliated on right than central area of left side. Cilia closely spaced at anterior end of
kineties, seemingly producing a platyophryid postoral pseudomembrane; however, most
ciliary rows extend to posterior region of cell, only some are strongly and irregularly
shortened (Fig. 209a, b, g, h, p, s-u; 429a-v). Silverlines in Platyophrya pattern throughout;
individual silverlines only slightly undulating and somewhat narrower spaced than dikinetids,
surround docked extrusomes and dikinetids (Fig. 209f, i, j, s-u; 429i-k).
Oral apparatus occupies almost entire anterior body end, conspicuous because large and on a
flat dome supported by fibres originating from paroral dikinetids (Fig. 209a-c, g, k, q, s, v;
429a-c, e-i, 1-p, t, w-y). Paroral membrane at right mouth margin, elongate C-shaped,
composed of about 35 rather widely spaced dikinetids in Austrian and German specimens and
of approximately 50-70 dikinetids in Australian and Kenyan cells; inner basal body of
dikinetids more lightly impregnated than outer; a minute, argyrophilic granule between each
two dikinetids. Both paroral basal body rows bear about 5 urn long cilia forming two different
membranes, as in —» Reticulowoodrujjia terricola: outer (right) row cilia appear thinner and
wider spaced than these of inner row, beat distinctly and individually in vivo; inner (left) row
cilia likely almost or entirely immobile and so close together that a ribbon-like structure is
formed appearing as a broad, bright wall in vivo (Fig. 429w-y). Adoral organelles at left
mouth margin in small grooves, orientated almost parallel to oral slit, tongue-shaped both in
the light and electron microscope; individual organelles composed of two rows of basal
bodies, however, only one of the rows has cilia increasing in length from about 2-4 urn
anteriorly to 5-7 urn posteriorly within each organelle; posteriormost organelle almost
invariable half the size of other organelles, as in —> Platyophiyides latus. Two to four thick
rods with a length of 7-20 urn originate from each organelle and extend posteriorly in the
pharyngeal wall. Number of adoral organelles rather variable: 3 in German type population;
3-4 in Austrian specimens; 6-8 in French specimens; 3-7, usually 5 in Finnish specimens; 7
in Australian specimens; and 4-6, usually 5 in Kenyan specimens. Likewise, the number of
basal bodies comprising a row within an organelle varies between 5 to 12. Oral opening slit-
like, pharynx cylindroidal and supported by many fine fibres likely originating from paroral
membrane and adoral organelles.
Occurrence and ecology: FOISSNER (1987c) discovered O. dragescoi in soil and
needle litter from a spruce forest near Ulm/Danube, Germany. Another population occurred in
mosses growing on spruce trunks in Salzburg, Austria. The Australian population was found
973

in bark of an Eucalyptus tree in the rain forest near Cairns (BLATTERER & FOISSNER 1988). In
Finland, we found O. dragescoi in the litter of a coniferous forest near the town of Savonlinna
(ol^OT^J 29°E). The African population used for the scanning electron microscopical
investigations was collected by Mag. Aline BERTHOLD on Mount Kenya at about 3300 m sea
level. This sample (pH 5.1) consisted mainly of Hagenia and grass litter, mixed with some
Sphagnum and soil. The Kenyan population was cultivated in Eau de Volvic with small
colpodids as food supply. DRAGESCO & DRAGESCO-KERNEIS (1979) did not provide the
source of their moss, likely it was from France. The reliable records, that is, those
substantiated by illustrations, indicate that O. dragescoi is a cosmopolitan species preferring
terrestrial habitats, especially moss and coniferous litter.
Comparison with related species: See detailed discussion under —»
Platyophryides latus. Basically, O. dragescoi is easily identified by the stout shape and the
long oral slit occupying the anterior body end. Only extreme shape variants can be mixed
with P. latus or Platyophrya similis (Fig. 210o-q).

Ottowphrya magna (FOISSNER, 1993) nov. comb, and Platyophryides sp. of
PUYTORAC et al. (1992)
Platyophryides magnus FOISSNER, 1993c has a platyophryid silverline pattern and thus
belongs to Ottowphrya. It differs from O. dragescoi by body size (> 140 urn vs. < 120 urn),,
number of ciliary rows (50 vs. < 40) and adoral organelles (9-10 vs. < 8, usually 5-6), as well
as by the structure of the adoral organelles (composed of 3 vs. 2 basal body rows).
However, PUYTORAC et al. (1992) described a Platyophryides which seemingly bridges the
gap between O. dragescoi and O. magna. We give the full description of this interesting
isolate because it is important for the systematics of the whole group.
When fed on bacteria and maintained in a culture medium made from a wheat infusion and
yeast extract, the protargol-stained ciliates are ovoid, about 85 urn in length (60-110 um, n =
32) and 68 urn in width (50-90 um, n = 32). The somatic kineties, composed of dikinetids,
are slightly spiralized, numbering 42 (34-48, n = 23), with two to three more right kineties
975

(16-25) than left kineties (15-22). There are no pre- or postoral sutures and no pseudo-
membrane formed from the ends of the left somatic kineties. The median macronucleus is
ovoid, 17-22 urn in length, and is flanked by a small micronucleus. There is a posterior
contractile vacuole.
The subapical buccal region is elongated along the anterior third of the ventral surface. From
30-45 urn (n = 23) in length, it is bordered on its right by a paroral formed from a double row
of kinetosomes and five to nine (n = 23) adoral membranelles. The anterior and posterior ends
of the paroral curve towards the left at either end of the superficial buccal region. The adoral
membranelles are aligned almost parallel to the long axis of the buccal region along its left
side.
When these cells have fed, they become immobile after rotating in one place. They secrete a
cyst and undergo one or two divisions. Under unfavourable conditions, resting cysts with
three wall layers appear.
When the cell density is high or when Tetrahymena or, even more effectively, Colpidium are
introduced, active predatory giants appear. Their size is quite variable, up to 5 times the size
of the bacterivorous forms. The number of somatic kineties more than doubles (87-112, n =
19), while the small difference between right kineties (46-58) and left kineties (41-54) is
maintained. The buccal region increases to 180-220 urn (n = 8) in length, with the paroral
maintaining its position along the right side of the buccal region and the number of adoral
membranelles increasing to 15-20 (n = 8). The macronucleus remains ovoid but increases to
50-78 urn (n = 13) in length.
If regularly fed ciliate prey, these giant forms grow and divide within cysts, like the
bacterivorous forms. However, if the prey numbers decrease, the cells rapidly become small.
In addition to division within cysts, resting cysts of the giant forms have also been observed.
Despite our efforts, we have been unable to observe stomatogenesis within the cysts.
Moreover, we have been unable to observe the process of transformation of small forms to
giants and the reverse transformation.
Unfortunately, PUYTORAC et al. (1992) do not describe the silverline pattern, which is, as we
now know, very important for the classification of this kind of colpodid. Thus, no final
conclusion can be drawn. However, we have convincing arguments that the Brazilian species
is very near or even is O. magna. PUYTORAC et al. (1992) show by transmission electron
microscopy that the adoral organelles of the Brazilian population are composed of triads
and/or three rows of basal bodies. Indeed, they state this as a unique feature of their isolate.
FOISSNER (1993c) stated the same in the diagnosis of O. magna: "9-10 adoral organelles
consisting of 3 rows of basal bodies each". Thus, the PUYTORAC et al. (1992) population is
likely O. magna. This is emphasized by the large size of both taxa and their Gondwanan
distribution: O. magna was discovered in a sand dune near the city of Singapore (FOISSNER
1993c), and PUYTORAC et al. (1992) isolated their species from a freshwater pond in Brasilia.
The special life cycle observed by PUYTORAC et al. (1992) does not contradict our proposal
because FOISSNER (1993c) could not study the cycle in O. magna. On the other hand, the
different habitats indicate different species.
Certainly, the Brazilian isolate is not —» Platyophryides latus or -» Ottowphrya dragescoi, as
proposed by PUYTORAC et al. (1992), because both have two-rowed adoral organelles, a rather
fundamental difference emphasized by the fact that the Brazilian isolate has all three rows
976

ciliated, while O. dragescoi has cilia associated only with one of the two rows; each of these
features is a species character of its own! Furthermore, we could not observe extreme
polymorphism in our cultures of O. dragescoi, despite that it was fed with ciliate prey.

1987 Platyophryides FOISSNER, Zool. Beitr., 31: 240. Type species (original designation): Platyophrya lata

Improved diagnosis: Moderately small to medium-sized platyophryid Colpodea
incertae sedis with silverlines in Colpoda pattern and conspicuous adoral organelles parallel
to paroral membrane.
Remarks: See FOISSNER (1993c) and remarks under genus —> Ottowphrya. The diagnosis
was emended with the silverline pattern, the sole but strong difference to —» Ottowphrya and
cleared from a doubtful feature, the postoral pseudomembrane, which is lacking according to
our new results in both Platyophryides and Ottowphrya. The genus is monotypic.

Neotype material: Neotypified from Jordanian population for reasons 1, 3, 5, 6 detailed
in chapter 2.4.2. Voucher slides from the Namibian site (71) population, where ontogenesis
was studied, also have been deposited (Table 1).
Improved diagnosis: Size about 80 x 35 urn in vivo. Bursiform with cylindroidally
narrowed, ventrally curved oral portion. About 20 ciliary rows. Oral apparatus occupies
anterior body end, consists of 4-5 adoral organelles and an about 10 urn long paroral
membrane comprising approximately 26 kinetids.
Redescription: The redescription is based on the Jordanian neotype population and
supplemented with data from the Namibian site (71) specimens, which impregnated so well
with protargol that ontogenesis could be studied in detail. Both populations agree in all main
features, so that conspecificity is beyond reasonable doubt. Morphometric differences, see

in about 70% of specimens; other individuals more or less Platyophrya-shaped, that is,
bursiform with the oral apparatus located subapically on ventral side (Fig. 210a, d, f, g, o, p;

about 3 um across, surrounded by a distinct membrane in protargol preparations, not in
perinuclear space of macronucleus (Fig. 210a, 211a; 430j, q). Contractile vacuole subterminal
with excretory pore at margin of ventral and right side. Cytopyge in posterior pole area,
marked by a peculiar, U-shaped silverline (Fig. 210d, g, n). Cortex inconspicuous, contains
numerous colourless, about 1 urn-sized granules, very likely mucocysts surrounded by a
silverline. Cytoplasm without specific inclusions, usually packed with fat globules and large
food vacuoles containing remnants of medium-sized ciliates, such as Colpoda maupasi and C.
steinii; the specimens from Marion Island were packed with fungal conidia. Swims and creeps
rather rapidly on microscope slide as well as on and between soil particles showing great
flexibility.
Somatic cilia about 8 urn long and paired throughout, arranged in 23 (Jordanian specimens)
or 18 (Namibian specimens) slightly to distinctly sigmoidal, bipolar rows more closely spaced
and densely ciliated on right than left side of cell; a short posterior pole suture is formed by
some shortened rows. At left mouth margin kineties commence with two to four, usually three
closely spaced kinetids which, however, do not form a postoral pseudomembrane, as
explained in figure 216g. Silverlines in Colpoda pattern throughout; individual silverlines
conspicuously undulating and about one and a half as closely spaced as kinetids, surround
docked extrusomes and dikinetids (Fig. 210d, g-k, m, 21 la, b; 430a-i, k-s; Table 191).
Oral apparatus occupies anterior body end, rather conspicuous. Paroral membrane at right
mouth margin, C-shaped, in Namibian specimens composed of an average of 26 (22-30, n =
5) dikinetids bearing about 5 urn long cilia; inner basal body of dikinetids smaller and more
lightly impregnated both in protargol and silver carbonate preparations. On average four
(Jordanian specimens) to five (Namibian specimens) adoral organelles on left mouth margin;
individual organelles cirrus-like in appropriately orientated specimens, located slightly
obliquely to main mouth axis, composed of two rows of basal bodies bearing about 5 urn long
cilia; proximal organelle distinctly smaller in most specimens, as in —> Ottowphrya dragescoi.
Oral opening slit-like, pharynx at right bordered by many fine rods originating from paroral
kinetids and conspicuously bifurcated proximally; left basket half supported by fine, only
occasionally impregnated fibres originating from adoral organelles (Fig. 210a, g, k-m, o, p,
21 la, b; 430a, h, k, s-u; Table 191).
Occurrence and ecology: The records known were reviewed by FOISSNER (1993c).
Currently, all those not illustrated are questionable because the species was not separated
from -> Ottowphrya dragescoi. Thus, only three reliable literature records remain: roof
mosses and Sphagnum in Germany (KAHL 1930a; Fig. 210a); San Anton waterfall in Mexico
(MADRAZO-GARIBAY & LÖPEZ-OCHOTERENA 1973; Fig. 210b), and Michigan, USA (LUNDIN
& WEST 1963; Fig. 210c). We found P. latus in a highly saline and slightly acidic (pH 5.4)
mixture of grass and soil from the beach of the subantarctic Marion Island (FOISSNER 1996b);
in mud (pH 6.6) from rock-pools of the Catanjapo River just before it runs into the Orinoco
about 10 km south of Porto Ayachucho, Venezuela; and in the highly saline and slightly
acidic (pH 5.4) sample from the Namibian site (71). The neotype population is from the
surroundings of Wadi Rum in Jordan (29°30'N 35°E). The sample was a mixture of plant
litter and brownish, highly saline (25%o) and circumneutral (pH 7.5) sand. Obviously, P. latus
is an euryhaline cosmopolitan preferring terrestrial biotopes.
Identification and comparison with related species: The original
description of P. latus is rather brief, but the figure (Fig. 210a) and the features mentioned match

our population well. Thus, the identification is very likely correct. Original description
(translated from German): "Shape broad (2:1), oral area distinctly projecting, ventral contour
thus strongly sigmoidal. Length 105 urn, very flat, bright, colourless, narrowly striated by the
ciliary rows. At left mouth margin 5-6 cirrus-like structures, at right mouth margin, which
has a narrow fringe, closely spaced short bristles; otherwise as Platyophrya spumacola.
Common, but much rarer than P. spumacola".
The most typical feature of P. latus is the cylindroidally narrowed, projecting oral area,
emphasized also by KAHL (1930a). It makes the species rather easily distinguishable from
other platyophryids, at least at population level. However, the Platyophrya-shaped specimens
are difficult to separate from P. sphagni, P. spumacola, and P. similis. Thus, silver
impregnation should be applied to reveal the silverline pattern, which is colpodid in
Platyophryides and platyophryid in Platyophrya. However, the species can be distinguished

The division furrow is now recognizable and the opisthe rotated by about 180° shifting the oral apparatus on the dorsolateral
margin of the cell (h). The new opisthe oral apparatus has on average more adoral organelles than that of morphostatic
specimens (Table 192), and its paroral appears to be composed of quadruplets of basal bodies (g). The proter oral apparatus
still lacks the pharyngeal basket (f)- The duplicated somatic kinetids move apart and macronucleus division is almost
completed. Scale bar 20 urn.

also on careful live observation by the orientation (parallel vs. distinctly oblique to main
mouth axis) and number (about six in P. latus vs. > seven in the Platyophrya species
mentioned above) of adoral organelles. Likewise, the extreme shape variants of P. latus and
O. dragescoi are difficult to distinguish (Fig. 210o-q); the different silverline pattern is the
only reliable feature. Usually, however, both are rather easily distinguished, even in vivo, by
the stouter shape and the much broader oral area: the ratio body width:length of paroral
membrane is 3-3.3:1 in P. latus and 2.3:1 in O. dragescoi (Fig. 210o-q; Table 192).
Ontogenesis: Platyophryides latus was very abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish
culture set up with the Namibian site (71) soil. Many excellently impregnated dividers were
found in the protargol slides, and thus a detailed description of the process can be provided.
Division is homothetogenic, pleurokinetal, and proceeds in freely motile (non-encysted)
condition. It commences with an intense duplication of basal bodies in the posterior ventral
half of about six right lateral kineties (Fig. 211c). Next, the cell begins to round up, the
macronucleus swells, and kinetid duplication occurs in all kineties producing basal body
triplets. The opisthe oral structures are assembling subequatorially on the ventral surface and
both paroral membrane and adoral organelles become recognizable. The parental (proter) oral
apparatus shows distinct signs of reorganization: the paroral dikinetids become scattered and
the pharyngeal basket disorganizes (Fig. 21 Id). When the cell becomes globular, the
macronucleus is elongate ellipsoidal and many basal body quadruplets are recognizable in the
ciliary rows. The opisthe oral structures are almost complete and in the axis of the proter oral
apparatus, whose paroral completed reorganization, while the pharyngeal basket was resorbed
(Fig. 2lie).

Middle dividers show the onset of cell division, accompanied by an about 90° rotation of the
opisthe relative to the proter. Thus, proter and opisthe oral apparatus are now on different
sides of the cell and cannot be seen at the same focal plane. The opisthe paroral is composed
of granule quadruplets, and macronucleus division is almost completed. The proter still lacks
a pharyngeal basket, and there is possibly some internal reorganization of the adoral
organelles (Fig. 21 If—h). On average, the opisthe oral apparatus has one adoral organelle
more than the interphase specimens (Table 192). Late and very late dividers are distinctly
dumb-bell-shaped and the opisthe is still rotated by 180° relative to the proter, which still
lacks a pharyngeal basket. The opisthe resorbs the supernumerary adoral organelles (Fig.
21 li, j). Post-dividers are globular and about half the size of interphase specimens (Table
192). The pharyngeal basket commences to form (Fig. 21 Ik, 1). Cell shaping obviously occurs
later. Micronuclear division could not followed because the micronucleus did not impregnate.
Ontogenetic comparison: Division of P. latus is highly similar to that of
cyrtolophosidid colpodids (for a review, see FOISSNER 1993c). The sole difference
noteworthy is the rather distinct proter reorganization, as yet observed only in Cyrtolophosis
spp. and Woodruffides metabolicus.
Etoschophrya nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small to medium-sized Woodruffiidae GELEI, 1954 with platyophryid
silverline system on right side and kreyellid on left. Paroral membrane elliptical, almost
closed to form a "circumoral kinety". Few adoral organelles extend beyond paroral
membrane.
Type species: Etoschophrya oscillatoriophaga nov. spec.
Etymology: Composite of Etoscha (German spelling of Etosha = great white pan in the
native language) and the Greek noun ophrya (eyebrow ~ cilia ~ ciliate s.l.), meaning a ciliate
from the Etosha Pan. Feminine gender.
Comparison with related genera: See FOISSNER (1993c) for family diagnosis and
a detailed review of all genera and species concerned. The general organization of
Etoschophrya indicates a relationship with either —» Kuklikophrya NJINE, 1979b (almost
"closed" paroral membrane) or —>• Rostrophryides FOISSNER, 1987c (see below and Fig. 212n,
o). Etoschophrya differs from both by the unique silverline system, and from Kuklikophrya
also by the lack of curved postoral kineties. Rostrophryides has a postoral pseudomembrane
lacking in Etoschophrya, as shown by a detailed analysis of several silver carbonate and
silver nitrate-impregnated, properly orientated specimens (Fig. 429e). However, the
occurrence of shortened postoral ciliary rows indicate a tendency to generate such an
organelle relating Etoschophrya to Rostrophryides. Certainly, Etoschophrya also resembles
Reticulowoodmffia FOISSNER, 1993c, especially in the silverline system. However,
Reticulowoodruffia has the oral apparatus orientated in the main body axis, possesses an only
slightly curved paroral membrane, and has a very different general appearance.
986

Etoschophrya oscillatoriophaga nov. spec. (Fig. 212a-m; 298, 431a-i, 442m;
Table 193)
Diagnosis: Size about 40 x 25 urn in vivo; obovoidal with inconspicuous beak at anterior
left end. On average, 18 somatic ciliary rows, 4 adoral organelles, and 24 paroral dikinetids.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 18°50'S 16°30'E
(site 67 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the preferred food {Oscillatoria sp.).
Description: Size 30-50 x 20-35 urn in vivo, usually about 40 x 25 urn, obviously
shrinks rather strongly in preparations due to the fragile cortex (Table 193). Shape highly
depending on nutrition state, basically laterally slightly flattened and obovoidal with dorsal
margin more distinctly convex than ventral; anterior left end, where the adoral organelle band
is located, usually slightly projecting providing some specimens with a Chilodonella
uncinata-\\ke outline (Fig. 212b). Starving cells conspicuously narrowing posteriorly, overfed
specimens almost globular. Nuclear apparatus in or near body centre. Macronucleus globular
and with large nucleoli. Micronucleus about 2.5 x 1.5 urn, in perinuclear space of
macronucleus, which becomes evident in stained specimens, where the macronuclear content
shrinks leaving the micronucleus attached to the inner macronuclear membrane (Fig. 212e).
Contractile vacuole subterminal with single excretory pore near left (ventral) margin of cell
(Fig. 212a, c, i, j). Cortex thin, fragile, often does not withstand formalin fixation as used for
silver carbonate impregnation, studded with rows of pale granules about 0.8 urn across; when
methyl green-pyronin is added, granules stain red and become extruded forming a
voluminous fibrous coat (Fig. 212f, g; 43If). Well-fed specimens green due to ingested
cyanobacteria; cytoplasm, however, colourless and opaque containing some 1-2 um-sized
lipid droplets and often many food vacuoles up to 20 urn across. Possibly feeds exclusively
on filamentous cyanobacteria {Oscillatoria sp.) ingested as short pieces breaking to globular
subunits in the food vacuoles (Fig. 212a). Vacuoles not spotted during digestion, as in many
nassulids, but turning to an inconspicuous yellowgreen. Some specimens contain many
argyrophilic rods, possibly bacteria (Fig. 43 lg). Swims fast to very fast in wide spirals; never
rests.
Somatic cilia about 7 urn long in vivo, paired except in posterior thirds of ventral and left
side, where only the posterior basal body of the dikinetids is ciliated (Fig. 431b). Cilia form
slightly spiral rows all commencing around oral apparatus, right side more densely ciliated
than left, where two to three shortened kineties composed of only 2-4 kinetids occur; usually,
one shortened kinety is on ventral side in the transition zone of right and left side kineties
(Fig. 212a, h-m; 431a, b, e). Distances of kinetids within kineties gradually increase from
anterior to posterior, first pair rather closely spaced and thus easily mistaken as postoral
pseudomembrane, as defined by FoiSSNER (1993c).
Oral apparatus in left anterior quadrant of cell, overall appearance flat and elliptical (Fig.
212a, h, j, 1; 298, 431a, c, d, h, i). Oral field elliptical and slightly concave, rather conspicuous
because opaque and bright. Centre with small slit marking inconspicuous, proximally
diverging oral basket hardly recognizable in live specimens. Paroral membrane at margin of
oral field, forms elliptical "circumoral kinety" because open only at anterior left end, where

open only at the left anterior corner, where four minute adoral organelles insert. The silverline system of E.
oscillatoriophaga is the main genus character because it is platyophryid on the right side and irregular (kreyellid) on the left.

(kreyellid) on the left, n, o: Somatic and oral ciliary pattern and silverline system of right and left side. Arrows mark adoral

features: the silverline system is platyophryid throughout (cp. figures 212m, o); the paroral membrane is short and thus does
not extend onto the left oral area (cp. figures 212j, n); and it has a postoral pseudomembrane (Fig. 212n, arrowhead; for
detailed explanation, see Fig. 216g). Seemingly, such a structure is present also in Etoschophrya (Fig. 212j, 1). However, a
detailed analysis shows that most postoral dikinetids are attached to a left side somatic kinety (Fig. 43 le). AO - adoral
organelle band, EP - excretory pore, MA - macronucleus, PM - paroral membrane. Scale bars 15 urn.
989

the adoral organeile band commences; composed of zigzagging dikinetids of which possibly
only one basal body bears an about 4 urn long cilium. Almost invariably four minute adoral
organelles: two at anterior left margin of oral field in continuation of paroral membrane and
two in a minute preoral suture; individual organelles with 5 urn long cilia and composed of
two ciliary rows with three basal bodies each; some basal bodies possibly barren or lacking,
especially in distalmost organelle; each organelle surrounded by fibrous material forming
short bundle obliquely extending posteriorly from left posterior corner of organelle.
Silverline system platyophryid on right side and kreyellid on left, with transition zone where
patterns abut. Platyophryid portion without peculiarities, kreyellid part very irregular and
most distinct in central area of left side (Fig. 212i, 1, m; 442m)33.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only in the highly saline soil sample from
type location, where it was abundant. Possibly, E. oscillatoriophaga is not a soil ciliate sensu

stricto, but mainly an inhabitant of ephemeral puddles with cyanobacterial mats. In any case,
the distribution must be very patchy because it was not found in other samples from this
region.
Comparison with related species: A similar species has not been described
(FoiSSNER 1993c). However, E. oscillatoriophaga is easily confused with —» Rostrophryides
africana FOISSNER, 1987c, which has a similar size, shape, and ciliary pattern (Fig. 212n, o);
in vivo, these species are best distinguished by the paroral membrane, which is easily
recognizable and C-shaped in R. africana. Inexperienced workers may even confuse E.
oscillatoriophaga with Chilodonella uncinata, which, however, never feeds on filamentous
cyanobacteria (FOISSNER et al. 1991).
Rostrophrya namibiensis nov. spec. (Fig. 213a-f, 214a—i; 432a-j, 433a-h,
434a; Table 194)
Diagnosis: Size about 130 x 40 urn in vivo, length:width ratio 3-3.7:1. Elongate
ellipsoidal with pointed or truncate rostrum; posterior portion narrowed or inflated. On
average 32—42 somatic ciliary rows. Oral aperture elongate elliptical with about 18 adoral
organelles, of which approximately 10 are on left vestibular slope.
Remarks: This species is split into two subspecies differing mainly in body shape and
number of ciliary rows. At first glance, -» R. fenestrata, described below, looks like a third
subspecies. However, including —> R. fenestrata in R. namibiensis would result in a very
broad, unnatural variability of this species, far outside that usually encountered in colpodids
(see table 1 in FOISSNER 1993C). Variability of kinety number, for instance, would increase
from the usual 6% to 26.4%, if the individual kinety numbers of R. namibiensis namibiensis,
R. namibiensis maldivensis, and -» R. fenestrata are pooled (x = 32.5, SD = 8.6, CV =
26.4%, n = 35).
The silverline system of Rostrophrya was unknown (FOISSNER 1993c). Our results show that
it is platyophryid, that is, has meshes divided by a longitudinal ("median") silverline between
each two kineties. Thus, all genera of the Woodruffiidae have a platyophryid silverline
system, except for —» Woodruffia, where it is colpodid (FOISSNER 1993c), indicating that the
group is biphyletic.
Comparison with related species (genus review, FOISSNER 1993c): Rostrophrya
namibiensis is easily distinguished from R. camerounensis and R. regis, discovered in
temporary pools of tropical Africa, by the smaller size (< 160 urn vs. > 160 urn) as well as the
much smaller number of ciliary rows (< 50 vs. > 80) and adoral organelles (< 20 vs. > 30).
Rostrophrya terricola FOISSNER, 1993c differs from R. namibiensis by the broader shape
(length:width ratio 2.5:1 vs. 3:1) and, especially, the much smaller and rounder oral opening
(8x6 urn vs. 15 x 5 urn). —» Rostrophrya fenestrata lacks a distinct rostrum, is usually
thinner (4:1 vs. 3-3.7:1), and has only half the number of ciliary rows and adoral organelles.
991

Rostrophrya namibiensis namibiensis nov. sspec. (Fig. 213a-f; 296, 297, 432a-
j; Table 194)
Diagnosis: Body shape regular, slightly sigmoidal and/or lanceolate, rostrum pointed,
narrowed posterior end rounded; length:width ratio about 3.7:1. On average 32 somatic ciliary
rows.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°S 15°50'E
(site 54 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size 100-150 x 30-45 urn, usually about 125 x 32 urn in vivo, length:width
ratio 3-4:1, on average 3.7:1. Shape regular as in R. terricola FOISSNER, 1993c, that is,
margins usually without indentations and convexities, often very slender and up to 2:1
dorsoventrally flattened; elongate ellipsoidal to fusiform, occasionally slightly sigmoidal,
rostrum pointed or narrowly rounded, posterior end usually slightly broader than anterior,
rarely bluntly pointed (Fig. 213a, d). Macronucleus near body centre, with thick membrane,
conspicuously small (about 15 x 10 urn in vivo) compared to size of cell, as in most other
members of order (FOISSNER 1993c). Micronucleus recognizable neither in vivo nor in silver
carbonate preparations. Contractile vacuole subterminal at left margin of cell, with single,
conspicuous collecting canal extending to mid-body at left margin. Cortex very flexible,
contains numerous colourless mucocysts about 0.8 urn across; mucocysts irregularly and
closely spaced on left side, while in distinct clusters on right forming peculiar pattern with
mitochondria at left side of ciliary rows (Fig. 213e, f). Cytoplasm colourless, contains
numerous lipid droplets about 1 urn across and many food vacuoles, mainly in posterior half
of cell. Feeds on bacteria, fungal conidia, and cyanobacterial filaments ingested as long pieces
later split into small portions forming about 10 um-sized, green food vacuoles turning orange
during digestion (Fig. 213a; 432a, h, i). Movement without peculiarities, glides rather rapidly
on microscope slide and soil particles showing great flexibility.
Cilia only about 7 urn long in vivo, mostly paired, some singles occur on less densely ciliated
dorsal side (Fig. 432j), form about 32 rows arranged as in other members of genus (FOISSNER
1993c), that is, slightly spiral producing distinct preoral suture containing adoral organelles;
some shortened ciliary rows commence along posterior left half of oral opening and generate
an indistinct postoral suture, where left and right side kineties abut. Anteriormost two or three
kinetids of each kinety more closely and very regularly spaced along left slope of oral
opening and preoral suture, producing membranoid ciliary condensation, but not a postoral
pseudomembrane, as in most Platyophryidae (FOISSNER 1993c), because most ciliary rows
extend to at least mid-body (Fig. 213b; 296, 297, 432a, b, e, h-i). Silverline system
platyophryid as in —» R. namibiensis maldivensis.
Oral opening slightly obliquely orientated to main body axis at base of rostrum, that is,
distinctly subapical; elongate elliptical, viz., about 10-15 x 4-6 urn in vivo (Fig. 213a-c; 296,
297, 432a-h). Paroral and adoral cilia only 3-4 urn long. Paroral membrane on right slope of
vestibulum, uncinate, that is, surrounds posterior end of oral opening; composed of about 42
dikinetids having only the proximal basal body ciliated in the uncinate portion because the
distal basal body is impregnated very faintly or not at all (Fig. 213c; 432c, e, f). On average

15 adoral organelles, of which about nine insert on left slope of vestibulum and six in preoral

organelles each composed of six basal bodies forming minute rectangles; distal basal body
pair slightly dislocated posteriad. Rostrum organelles minute, each consisting of only three
basal bodies forming small, oblique rows surrounded by faintly impregnated material
producing small process at left anterior corner of organelles (Fig. 213c; 432e). Oral basket
recognizable neither in vivo nor in silver carbonate preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at three sites (53, 54, 70) in Namibia,
all highly saline, indicating that it prefers saline soils.

Diagnosis: Body with indentations and convexities, rostrum angular, posterior end
usually inflated and widely rounded; length:width ratio about 3:1. On average 42 somatic
ciliary rows.
Type location: Coastal soil near the village of Hembadoo, North Male Atoll, Maldives,
04°N 74°E.
Etymology: Named after the country discovered.
Description: Size 100-160 x 35-60 urn in vivo, usually about 130 x 42 urn, length:width
ratio 2.3-3.7:1, on average 3:1. Shape elongate ellipsoidal, dorsoventrally slightly flattened,
often rather irregular, that is, with some small indentations and convexities; usually gradually
broadening from anterior to posterior, rear end thus widely rounded, preoral portion narrows
to obliquely truncate rostrum, making the organism easily recognizable (Fig. 214a, h, i);
rostrum, however, rounded in silver preparations, obviously due to insufficient preservation
(Fig. 214b, e). Very flexible, slightly decreasing in length and becoming broader when
touching an obstacle during forward gliding (Fig. 214h, i), and up to 50% contractile under
slight cover glass pressure. Macronucleus subequatorial, broadly ellipsoidal (22 x 14 urn;
Table 194), with an about 0.7 urn thick membrane containing micronucleus 3-4 urn across;
nucleolus reticular (Fig. 433d). Contractile vacuole subterminal at left margin of cell,
occupies posterior end when filled completely and bulges cell margin just before emptying;
with single, conspicuous collecting canal extending to level of oral apparatus at left body
margin. Cytopyge in posterior end slightly left of midline; faecal mass slimy containing some
crystals (Fig. 214a, h). Cortex very flexible, contains numerous colourless mucocysts about
0.5 jam across; on ventral side, mucocysts form necklet-like strand between each two kineties
and clusters around individual kinetids; on dorsal side, they are rather irregularly arranged
(Fig. 214f, g; 433a). Cytoplasm colourless and finely granulated, cells usually very transpar-
ent; contains some lipid droplets 3-8 urn across mainly in posterior half of cell; not vacu-
olized as in R. terricola FOISSNER, 1993c. Food vacuoles bright and with indeterminable
content. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide and soil particles, showing a great
flexibility; swims slowly by rotation about main body axis.

Cilia only about 7 urn long in vivo, paired throughout, even on less densely ciliated dorsal
side, form about 42 rows arranged as in other members of genus (FOISSNER 1993 c), that is,
slightly spiral producing distinct preoral suture containing adoral organelles; kineties in rather
deep furrows on right side and often somewhat irregular at various sites of cell, possibly due
to small injuries. Some shortened ciliary rows commence along posterior left half of oral
opening and generate rather indistinct postoral suture, where left and right side kineties abut.
Postoral kinetids along left margin of oral opening and preoral suture very regularly arranged
forming crossed pattern (Fig. 214a-c; 433e-i). Silverline system platyophryid, as described in
remarks on species diagnosis (Fig. 214d; 433b, c).

Oral opening in main body axis at base of rostrum, commences about 17 urn back from
anterior end; elongate elliptical, that is, 17 x 5 urn in silver nitrate preparations. Details of
ciliary pattern as shown in figure 213c of —» R. namibiensis namibiensis. Paroral membrane
on right vestibular slope, uncinate, that is, surrounds posterior end of oral opening, composed
of about 57 dikinetids bearing 4-5 urn long cilia; uncinate portion either composed of
monokinetids or of dikinetids having only the proximal basal body ciliated. About same
number (10-11) of adoral organelles each on left slope of vestibulum and in preoral suture.
Slope organelles each composed of six basal bodies forming minute rectangles having small,
fibrillar process at left posterior corner; cilia within individual organelles of different length,
that is, 2-5 urn. Rostrum organelles minute, each consisting of only three basal bodies
forming small, oblique rows surrounded by faintly impregnated material producing small
process at anterior left corner of organelles (Fig. 214a-c, e, i; 433e-i, 434a).
Occurrence and ecology: The sample from type location was collected by Dr.
Wolfgang PETZ (Salzburg University) about 15 m inshore in a coco forest. The dark grey,
highly saline soil had pH 7.5 and was mixed with surface litter and roots from grasses and
shrubs. Rostrophrya namibiensis maldivensis was found, inter alia, also at the highly saline
Namibian sites (11) and (54), indicating that it prefers saline soils or is euryhaline.
Rostrophrya fenestrata nov. spec. (Fig. 215a-h; 434b-l, 442J-1; Table 194)
Diagnosis: Size about 85 x 15 urn in vivo, length:width ratio thus 6:1. Body elongate
ellipsoidal and distinctly curved, both ends narrowly rounded. 19 somatic kineties on average.
Oral aperture minute, that is, 5 x 3 urn; 9 adoral organelles on average, of which 4 are on left
vestibular slope.
Type location: Highly saline crust soil on quartz pieces in the coastal National Park near
Lüderitz, Namibia, 26°40'S 15°10'E (site 11 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: The Latin noun fenestrata (window) does not refer to the species as such,
but to its peculiar habitat, that is, the "window" fauna and flora developing under transparent
quartz pieces (for details, see site description in chapter 2.1.2).
Description: Size 70-110 x 15-20 urn in vivo, usually about 85 x 15 urn, length:width
ratio 5-6:1, usually near 6:1. Shape regular as in R. terhcola FOISSNER, 1993c, that is,
margins without indentations or convexities; highly variable but often more or less distinctly
curved (maintained even in silver carbonate preparations; Fig. 434b-g) and invariably very
slender, even in well-fed specimens; rostrum morphologically indistinguishable. The
following shape variants were recorded: slightly to distinctly curved and narrowing posteri-
orly with both ends narrowly rounded (Fig. 215a, e, h); slightly to distinctly curved and linear
with both ends narrowly rounded (Fig. 215d); slightly sigmoidal and linear with anterior end
narrowly rounded and pointed (Fig. 215f); slightly curved and narrowed posteriorly with both
ends posterior pointed (Fig. 215g). Flattened dorsoventrally up to 1.5:1, very flexible and
even contractile by up to 25% when touching an obstacle, showing characteristic posterior
knee (Fig. 215d, e, g, h). Macronucleus in body centre, ellipsoidal, with thick membrane and
reticular nucleolus. Micronucleus difficult to recognize in vivo, attached to macronucleus in
silver carbonate preparations. Contractile vacuole subterminal at left margin of cell, with single

collecting canal extending to mid-body. Cortex very flexible, contains numerous colourless
mucocysts about 0.5 urn across; mucocyst pattern as in —» R. namibiensis maldivensis, that is,
a necklet-like strand between each two kineties on right side, while rather irregular on left
(Fig. 215c; 442J-1). Cytoplasm colourless, contains numerous minute lipid droplets about 1
urn across and, in posterior half, many slightly irregular fat inclusions 3-4 urn across; not
vacuolized as in R. terricola FOISSNER, 1993c. Slowly gliding on water surface, microscope
slide and soil particles showing great flexibility.
Cilia paired throughout, even on less densely ciliated dorsal side, form 18-19 rows arranged
as in other members of genus (FOISSNER 1993c), that is, slightly spiral forming distinct
preoral suture containing adoral organelles; some shortened ciliary rows commence along left
posterior margin of oral opening and produce rather distinct postoral suture, where left and
right side kineties abut. Ciliature not polymerized underneath left vestibular slope (Fig. 215a,
b; 434b-i). Silverline system not studied.
Oral opening in main body axis and distinctly subterminal, that is, at border of first and
second sixth of body, conspicuously small, viz. about 5 x 3 (am in vivo (Fig. 215a, b; 434b, d-
i). Paroral membrane on right slope of vestibulum, uncinate, that is, surrounds posterior end
of oral opening, composed of dikinetids throughout bearing 4 urn long cilia. 9—10 minute,
rectangular adoral organelles, of which 4-5 insert along left slope of vestibulum and 5-6 in
preoral suture; slope and preoral adoral organelles of same size and thus possibly also of same
structure, have minute process (fibre?) at left posterior corner. Oral basket recognizable
neither in vivo nor in silver carbonate preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: Occurs at several moderately to highly saline sites of
Namibia, including the Dune Sea Namib and the Etosha Pan margin (Table 4). Furthermore,
we found R. fenestrata in Saudi Arabia, where it occurred also in a highly saline (21%o, pH
6.7) soil sample from near the village of Alqasab, about 130 km northeast of Riyadh.
However, the Saudi Arabian specimens are larger, that is, have about 25 ciliary rows, 12
adoral organelles and 30 paroral dikinetids; thus, they might represent a distinct subspecies.
Likely, R. fenestrata prefers saline, extreme soils.
Comparison with related species: Rostrophryafenestrata is much more slender
(5-6:1 vs. < 4:1) and has distinctly fewer ciliary rows (20 vs. > 30) and adoral organelles (10
vs. > 15) than any other described species of the genus (FOISSNER 1993c). Furthermore, it
lacks a morphological rostrum, the postoral polymerization of the ciliature, "monokinetids" in
the uncinate portion of the paroral, and (possibly) a structural differentiation of the slope and
preoral adoral organelles. Certainly, the morphological differences look inconspicuous but
might be of greater importance than presently assumed, especially the lack of the postoral
polymerization of the ciliature and of "monokinetids" in the uncinate portion of the paroral
(cp. —» R. namibiensis maldivensis).
Rostrophryides africana FOISSNER, 1987
We split this species into two subspecies according to distinct morphometric differences of
the Kenyan and the Namibian populations.
999

Improved diagnosis: Size 40-70 x 20-30 um in vivo. About 15-26 somatic ciliary
rows, which form a typical or modified postoral pseudomembrane. 5-9 adoral organelles.
Rostrophryides africana africana FoiSSNER, 1987c nov. stat.
Diagnosis (from FOISSNER 1987c): Size about 40-60 x 20-30 urn in vivo. About 10-15
somatic ciliary rows, which form a typical postoral pseudomembrane. 5-7 adoral organelles.
Locus classicus: Highly saline soil from margin of Lake Nakuru in Kenya (East
Africa).
Remarks: The features of the type population were confirmed on reinvestigation of
specimens from a saline, sandy soil from the coast of Florida, USA (FOISSNER 1993c).
Rostrophryides africana etoschensis nov. sspec. (Fig. 216a-f; Table 195)
Diagnosis: Size about 60 x 25 urn in vivo. On average 23 somatic ciliary rows, which
form a modified postoral pseudomembrane composed of postoral kinety fragments with more
than two dikinetids. Usually 8 adoral organelles.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 18°50'S 16°30'E
(site 67 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the region discovered.
Description: Size 50-70 x 20-30 urn in vivo, usually about 60 x 25 urn. Ellipsoidal with
anterior left end bluntly pointed and posterior broadly rounded (Fig. 216a, d); slightly to
distinctly flattened laterally depending on nutrition state. Nuclear apparatus in middle third of
cell, slightly subequatorial on average (Table 195). Micronucleus tightly attached to macro-
nucleus and thus very likely in its perinuclear space, as in other members of order (FOISSNER
1993c). Contractile vacuole and excretory pore subterminal on ventral side (Fig. 216a, b, d).
Cortex colourless and very flexible; cortical granules (mucocysts) likely present but not
studied. Cytoplasm with some lipid droplets and food vacuoles containing cyanobacterial and
ciliate (?) remnants. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide.
Somatic and oral ciliary pattern similar as in R. africana africana, mainly differing in
morphometric details (Table 195). Thus, we concentrate on the postoral pseudomembrane,
which is prominent but rarely consists of pairs of dikinetids, as is usual (Fig. 216g), but of
three or more dikinetids producing many irregularly shortened postoral ciliary rows (Fig.
216b—f)- Adoral organelle band rather conspicuous, two organelles in minute preoral suture.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, a highly saline soil.
All records of R. africana africana are from saline soil habitats too, indicating that R.
africana is possibly restricted, or at least prefers saline, terrestrial habitats. Distribution is
likely cosmopolitan (FOISSNER 1998a).

Generic assignment: We classify the Namibian population in Rostrophryides because
its overall organization is most similar to R. africana, type of genus (FOISSNER 1993c).
However, the postoral pseudomembrane, although very distinct, lacks the usual structure
shown in figure 216g. In this feature, the Namibian population is similar to Woodruffides and
Woodruffia because most of the postoral kineties consist of more than two kinetids. It seems
that the postoral pseudomembrane is a difficult (weak) genus character. On the other hand, we
would dislike to synonymize these genera because then, for instance, the small Rostro-
phryides africana would fall into the same genus as the large Woodruffides metabolicus. Or
species with platyophryid (Rostrophryides, Woodruffides) and colpodid (Woodruffia)
1002

silverline system would be in the same genus, if all genera are put together. Further studies
are necessary.
Comparison with related species: The population from the Etosha Pan highly
resembles Rostrophryides qfricana, differing from that species mainly by the higher number
of ciliary rows (23 vs. 10-15) and the lack of a typical postoral pseudomembrane (see above).
On the other hand, the dense postoral ciliature is a distinct difference to the few (~8) kinetid
quadruplets present in R. qfricana, as described in FoiSSNER (1993c). Certainly, these
differences are partially related to the larger size of the Pan specimens (54 x 27 urn vs. 46 x
20 jim in silver-prepared specimens). Thus, we classify the Namibian population as a
subspecies only.
Kuklikophrya ougandae (DRAGESCO, 1972) FOISSNER, 1993c (Fig. 217a-p;
435a-u, 436a-g; Table 196)
Nomenclature and synonymy: See FoiSSNER (1993c). The main genus features are
the curved postoral kineties and the paroral membrane, which is open only at left anterior
corner, where the adoral organelle band commences. We do not neotypify K. ougandae,
although type material has not been mentioned previously (FoiSSNER 1993 c), because it has a
firm identity and our observations largely agree with the literature data. Voucher slides from
our material have been deposited (Table 1).
Description of Namibian population: Most in vivo observations are from
specimens of a non-flooded Petri dish culture from site (67). We could cultivate K. ougandae
for some months with Oscillatoria sp., but growth was slow and did not produce high
densities.
Size 100-170 x 50-90 urn in vivo, usually about 140 x 70 um. Shape also highly variable, as
already mentioned by DRAGESCO (1972), usually, however, ChilodonellaAike, that is, with
rather conspicuous rostrum anteriorly left of oral opening and posteriorly, producing a more
or less distinct sigmoidal outline (Fig. 217a, 1, m); both, rostrum and posterior pointing rather
fragile and thus only partially preserved in preparations (Fig. 217b, k). Highly flexible and 2-
3:1 dorsoventrally flattened, depending on nutrition conditions; strongly flattened specimens
look like swimming leaves. Nuclear apparatus in middle third of cell, on average subequato-
rial, anchored to the cortex by a fibrous basket with long extensions, a unique property within
the class (Fig. 217 1; 435 1). Macrönucleus slightly ellipsoidal, about 20 um across in vivo,
with reticular nucleolus. Micronucleus lenticular, about 4 um across in vivo, tightly attached
to and thus very likely within perinuclear space of macrönucleus (Fig. 217a, k; 435c, 436a).
Contractile vacuole not registered, near posterior body end in Austrian specimens; excretory
pore not impregnated. Cortex flexible and bright due to many scattered mucocysts (Fig. 217i).
Mucocysts difficult to recognize in vivo because of similar shape (globular) and size (1 urn)
as mitochondria and easily extruded, for instance, when cells are slightly squeezed by the
cover glass or fixed for scanning electron microscopy; stain red and become extruded when
methyl green-pyronin is added, forming voluminous reticulum around cell (Fig. 217i, j; 435f-
j, r). Cytoplasm colourless, cells, however, greenish due to many food vacuoles with
filamentous cyanobacteria ingested as rather long pieces soon breaking into about 5 um-sized

in the anterior half of the cell; postorally, they form a rather distinct suture (asterisk). The adoral organelle band commences
in the left anterior corner of the oral field and extends onto the dorsal side (arrowhead). Further details, see next plate. I, m:
Rare shape variants. A fibrous coat with long branches encloses and anchors the nuclear apparatus in the cell (I). This is a
unique property within the class (FOISSNER 1993c). n: The Austrian specimens have very similar shapes as the Namibian
ones. BA - oral basket, NA - nuclear apparatus. Scale bar 30 urn.

Fig. 217o, p. Kuklikophrya ougandae, ventral and dorsal oral ciliary pattern of a Namibian specimen after protargol
impregnation. The genus is defined by two oral features: (i) the paroral membrane is open only at the anterior left corner,
where the adoral band commences; (ii) some postoral ciliary rows (arrowheads), whose anterior portion is strongly bent and
bears very closely spaced cilia, curve around the proximal oral vertex, producing a membranoid structure. Note that the
proximal adoral organelles are composed of two to three rows of basal bodies, while the distal ones consist of a single row of
cilia. AO - adoral organelles, 00 - oral opening, PM - paroral membrane. Scale bar 20 urn.

fragments, several of which form food vacuoles 15-20 urn across; further the cytoplasm
contains numerous 1-3 um-sized lipid droplets and countless mucocysts revealed by methyl
green-pyronin. Usually glides slowly between filamentous cyanobacteria showing great
flexibility.
Somatic ciliature dikinetidal, cilia about 10 urn long in vivo, paired in oral region and right
anterior half of cell, anterior basal body of dikinetids bare in other body regions (Fig. 217a,
k). Ciliary rows commence along adoral band and oral opening, follow body curvature, and
terminate in loosely ciliated posterior pole area (Fig. 217k; 435a, b, n, o). The following
specializations occur in structure and pattern of rows: (i) the very densely ciliated anterior
portion of some postoral rows sharply curves rightwards, forming membranoid structures
around posterior oral vertex (Fig. 217k, o; 435e, 1, p, q, s); (ii) the kinetids are very regularly
arranged and form a special field between right dorsal body margin, adoral band, and oral
opening (Fig. 217k; 435a, b, e, q, 436a, c); (iii) some rows are shortened postorally right of
midline, producing a rather distinct postoral suture (Fig. 217k; 435a); (iv) the preoral suture,
which contains the adoral band, traverses the rostrum and extends onto dorsal side, forming a
minute but distinct dorsal suture (Fig. 217b, o, p; 435 1, m, o, 436d, e).
Oral field (area surrounded by paroral membrane) on average 34% back from peak of rostrum
in midline of cell and obliquely orientated to main body axis, slightly depressed and elongate
dumb-bell-shaped (3:1) due to concave left margin. Oral slit in centre of oral field, membra-
nous, can open widely during ingestion of filamentous cyanobacteria. Oral basket rather
inconspicuous, composed of fine rods originating from paroral dikinetids and forming stout,
about 30 urn long funnel directed dorsally and posteriorly; impregnates faintly with protargol,
but not with silver carbonate; individual rods with distinct apical inflation and tooth, both
obviously overlooked previously (Fig. 217a, c, k, 1; 435a, p, q, 436a). Oral ciliature composed
of a paroral membrane and a long band of adoral organelles extending onto dorsal side of
rostrum; additionally, the densely ciliated anterior region of some postoral ciliary rows forms
some kind of circumoral ciliature, as described above (Fig. 217a, k, o, p; 435a, p, q-t, 436b, c,
f, g). Paroral membrane slightly dumb-bell-shaped due to concave left side, surrounds almost
entire oral field, except for break in left anterior corner, where the adoral band commences;
composed of more or less distinctly zigzagging dikinetids associated with oral basket rods, as
described above, and about 5 urn long cilia very closely spaced in left posterior portion of
membrane. Adoral band composed of 13 organelles on average (Table 196), extends across
rostrum onto dorsal side producing small suture, as described above; individual organelles
proximally more narrowly spaced than distally and of different structure in various regions of
band, details however difficult to recognize due to their small size: first two or three organ-
elles in left anterior comer of oral field, that is, between ends of paroral, each very likely
composed of three minute basal body rows, of which one is possibly unciliated; then follow
three or four organelles, each composed of two basal body rows, of which the distal row is
shorter and possibly unciliated; the distal organelles each consists of five to seven, about 7
urn long cilia in a single row.
Silverline system platyophryid throughout, as already described by DRAGESCO (1972); rather
finely and irregularly meshed in loosely ciliated posterior pole area (Fig. 217b; 435o, u).
Reproduction: Kuklikophrya ougandae reproduces in globular to slightly ellipsoidal,
green (due to the food vacuoles) division cysts producing four offspring. Interestingly, the
cysts have a 1-3 urn thick, firm membrane covered by an about 10 urn wide mucous layer to
1007

which bacteria and debris adhere (Fig. 217d; 435d, k; Table 196); furthermore, dividers
excrete brownish food remnants remaining in the mucous layer.
Observations on a Kenyan population: In Kenya, K. ougandae occurred in dark
grey, highly saline soil from the margin of the Nakuru Lake. The specimens were smaller
(about 100 x 50 urn) than those from Namibia and the rostrum was occasionally lacking (Fig.
217e-g). The ciliary pattern was not studied in detail, but appeared very similar to that of the
Namibian specimens.
Observations on an Austrian population: In autumn 1994, we were highly
surprised to find K. ougandae in a saline, alkaline soil sample from the surroundings of
Illmitz, Burgenland, eastern Austria (47°45'N 16°48'E). Although we looked for differences
to the African populations, we could not find any! Even the number of adoral organelles (11-
12, mostly 12, n = 9) and the complex oral and circumoral ciliature were highly similar,
including the field of ordered kinetids in the right anterior body region (Fig. 217h, n; 436a-g).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found in Rwanda, Cameroun, Austria, Venezuela,
and possibly also in Azerbaijan (FOISSNER 1993c). In Namibia, K. ougandae occurred, like in
Kenya and Austria, only at the highly saline sites 57, 65, 67 (Table 4), indicating that it
prefers such habitats. As an Oscillatoria feeder, K. ougandae is not a strictly terricolous
species but an inhabitant of flooded soils and ephemeral pools.
Comparison with literature data: Our observations significantly supplement, but

basically agree with previous descriptions reviewed in FoiSSNER (1993c); even the main
morphometrics are very similar. Thus, conspecificity is beyond reasonable doubts. Of course,
there are some differences, but all are inconspicuous or can be related to methodological
peculiarities. DRAGESCO (1972), for instance, did not recognize the break in the paroral
membrane because such details are difficult to see in silver nitrate preparations, and NJINE
(1979c) illustrated all adoral organelles composed of two rows of basal bodies.
Woodruffides terricola FOISSNER, 1987c (Fig. 218a-p; 299, 300,437a-n; Tables
197, 198)
Neotype material: Neotypified from cultivated specimens of Namibian site (55)
according to reasons 1, 4, 6 given in chapter 2.4.2. The original description of W. terricola is
based on live observations and transient silver carbonate impregnations; thus, no type
material is available. As the species is rather similar to W. metabolicus, which also lacks type
material, neotype slides with CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate-impregnated specimens have
been deposited (Table 1).
Improved diagnosis (contains all new data described below): Size 110-200 x 40-100
urn in vivo, usually about 160 x 70 urn. 40-65, usually about 50 somatic ciliary rows. 13-28,
usually about 21 adoral organelles. Paroral membrane curved, ends at proximal oral vertex.
Description of Namibian neotype population (Fig. 218a-d, g; 299, 300,
437a-c, f, g): The description is based on specimens from a multispecies culture set up in Eau
de Volvic containing some crushed wheat grains to stimulate growth of indigenous food
organisms, mainly Colpoda cavicola and C. maupasi.
Size 120-200 x 60-90 urn in vivo, usually about 160 x 70 urn, length:width ratio 1.8-3.5:1,
on average 2.3:1 (Table 197). Shape highly variable, many intermediate forms occur between
that of the type specimen (FOISSNER 1987c, Fig. 17a) and a "typical" W. metabolicus cell
(FOISSNER 1987c, Fig. 22a) as in the population from the Galapagos Islands (Fig. 218h-l).
Usually, however, broadly rounded posteriorly and slightly narrowed and rostrate anteriorly;
up to 2:1 flattened laterally, depending on nutrition state; anterior body half frequently rather
distinctly twisted about main body axis, oral field thus turned upright when cell glides on left
side (Fig. 218a). Nuclear apparatus in middle third of body, small compared to size of cell
(Fig. 218a; 437a). Macronucleus about 25 x 15 urn in vivo, with distinct membrane and
reticular nucleolus. Micronucleus minute and closely attached to macronucleus^ very likely in
perinuclear space, as in other members of order (FOISSNER 1993C). Contractile vacuole
subterminal in ventral side, with several small and large excretory pores along ventral canal,
strongly bulges cell surface (Fig. 218a, k) or occupies posterior body portion (Fig. 218b)
when filled completely. Cortex very flexible, yellowish due to 0.7 um-sized granules forming
a stripe each between two ciliary rows (Fig. 218g). An opaque fibre, very likely a transverse
microtubule ribbon (FOISSNER 1993c), left of ciliary rows (Fig. 218g; 437k). Cytoplasm of
specimens from flourishing cultures packed with fat globules 1-7 jam across and large food
vacuoles containing decaying Colpoda cavicola; smaller ciliates (e.g. -» Vorticella echini)
and other protists, such as flagellates and cysts of naked amoebae, are also ingested. Glides
rather rapidly on microscope slide and organic debris showing great flexibility.

Somatic cilia about 10 urn long, arranged in slightly spiral rows all commencing around oral
opening; those of right side abut on paroral membrane at steep angles, while those of left side
abut almost at right angles on left mouth margin. Kinetids very closely spaced in anterior
portion of kineties, but do not form a postoral pseudomembrane (see —> Rostrophryides
africana for explanation) because most ciliary rows extend to or near to posterior body end;
only few are more or less distinctly shortened, especially those commencing around buccal
vertex (Fig. 218m, n; 299, 300, 437a, c, f, g). Silverline system platyophryid throughout.
Woodrujfia, in contrast, has a colpodid silverline pattern, that is, lacks a median silverline
between each two ciliary rows (FOISSNER 1993C).
Oral apparatus in left upper quadrant of cell. Oral field a narrow, crescent-shaped area in
anterior 11-26%, on average 19% of body length, recognizable even at low magnification (~
xlOO) due to the thickened, bright right mouth margin, extends in main body axis or slightly
obliquely to left anterior end (Fig. 218a; 299, 300, 437e, h; Table 197). Oral slit closed and
thus inconspicuous, but can open widely when large prey is ingested, such as Colpoda
cavicola and rotifers. Paroral restricted to right mouth margin, distinctly curved, composed of
zigzagging basal bodies (dikinetids) with about 8 urn long cilia forming membranoid
structure. Adoral organelles at left, concave mouth margin, one of them in minute preoral
suture; composed of two kineties with four basal bodies each, cilia unite to minute, 8 urn long
bundles; surrounded by faintly impregnated material forming conspicuous fibre extending
obliquely backward from posterior left corner of organelles (Fig. 218a, d; 437a, e, f, g).
Nematodesmata recognizable in vivo, one bundle each originates from paroral dikinetids and
adoral organelles to contribute to the broad oral funnel obliquely extending to mid-body;
adoral nematodesmal bundles thicker than paroral (Fig. 218a; 43 7d).
Observations on other populations: The specimens from the Galapagos Islands
and from a highly saline soil of the Maldives are very similar to those from Namibian site 55
(Fig. 437h-n; Table 198). However, both have two adoral organelles in the preoral suture, as
the Austrian type specimens, which are slightly smaller in all main features, very likely
because they are from a weak population (Table 198). See figure explanations for further
details.
Occurrence and ecology: Woodruffides terricola obviously is a cosmopolitan,
euryhaline ciliate, possibly restricted or at least preferring terrestrial habitats. In Namibia, it
occurred in a variety of habitats (sites 3, 5, 40, 43, 48, 55, 73), showing its great ecological
plasticity. In Hawaii, it was found in the mud of an ephemeral brook.
Comparison with —» Woodruffides metabolicus: The genus Woodruffides
comprises only two species, viz., W. metabolicus and W. terricola (for a review, see FOISSNER
1993c). Possibly, further species exist, although we do not have any in our notebook.
Woodruffides terricola is usually smaller than W. metabolicus (about 160 x 70 urn vs. 200 x
100 urn), and thus has fewer ciliary rows (about 50 vs. > 50) and adoral organelles (about 21
vs. > 30). Such differences, however, would justify only subspecies rank. Fortunately, there is
now also a distinct morphological difference, not recognized by FOISSNER (1987c, 1993c):
the paroral membrane of W. terricola is restricted to the right mouth margin, while that of —»
W. metabolicus extends onto the left mouth margin posteriorly (Fig. 438g, h). This difference
occurs in each three populations and is thus a reliable species feature.
1013

Woodruffides metabolicus (JOHNSON & LARSON, 1938) FOISSNER, 1987C (Fig.
438a-h; Table 199)
Woodruffides metabolicus was thoroughly reviewed by FOISSNER (1993c). Thus, we report
only supplementary observations from a population of Namibian site 70 (Fig. 438a-h),
emphasizing the paroral membrane, which sharply curves to the left at the proximal mouth
margin to end some distance above. This is an important, constant morphological difference
to —> W. terricola.
Table 199 reviews some morphometric data, including new observations from populations of
Namibian site (70) and the Cape Verde Islands. These data show, although not very detailed,
that W. metabolicus is usually distinctly larger (about 200 x 100 urn vs. 160 x 70 urn) and has
more adoral organelles (> 30 vs. < 30) than -> W. terricola.

Woodruffia australis FOISSNER, 1993c (Fig. 439a-d; Table 200)
This species occurred together with —> Rostrophrya fenestrata, from which it was not easily
separated because the location of the oral opening, a main distinguishing feature in vivo, is
recognizable only at high magnification. It grew rather well for some time in Eau de Volvic
with some crushed wheat grains and soil to stimulate growth of the natural bacteria and
protist community.
The Namibian specimens, which occurred, like the type, in a highly saline soil sample, match
the Australian type material very well in body shape and the somatic and oral ciliary pattern
(Fig. 439a-d). They are, however, smaller and thus have fewer ciliary rows, adoral organelles,
and paroral dikinetids (Table 200). The fine structure of the adoral organelles is also slightly
different, indicating that the Namibian population could be a distinct subspecies.

Improved diagnosis: Size 70-140 x 25-50 urn in vivo. On average 18-22 somatic
kineties and a series of 8-9 adoral organelles with distances gradually increasing distally.
Description of Namibian populations and comparison with original
description: FOISSNER (1993c) described R. terricola from CHATTON-LWOFF silver
nitrate prepared specimens. Fortunately, we rediscovered the species in Namibia and could
perform detailed in vivo and scanning electron microscopic observations, including some
main ontogenetic stages. The oral and somatic ciliary and silverline pattern of the Namibian
populations is highly similar to that of the USA type specimens. Thus, conspecificity is
beyond reasonable doubt and emphasized by the very similar morphometrics (Table 201).
Cyrtolophosidid colpodids of this kind are difficult to identify in vivo because they closely
resemble Woodruffia rostrata and —» W. australis, and inexperienced workers may even confuse

them with Platyophrya spumacola or —»• Woodruffides terricola. Thus, silver nitrate
impregnation is indispensable for a reliable identification: only Reticulowoodruffia has a
narrowly-meshed silverline pattern (Fig. 2191; 440b, c, e, f).
Population from Namibian site 39 (Fig. 219b, h-k; 440a-y, 441 a-j; Table 201):
This population developed in the same culture as -> Exocolpoda augustini and was fixed
during exponential growth, as shown by several dividers. Size 90-130 x 30-50 urn in vivo,
usually near 110 x 40 urn, length:width ratio also highly variable, viz., 1.7-4:1, on average
2.7:1 in silver nitrate preparations (Table 201). Shape basically oval and slightly reniform
with anterior end pointed and posterior often broadly rounded, in detail, however, highly
variable because cells are slightly contractile, flattened up to 2:1 dorsoventrally, and
frequently slightly twisted about main body axis (Fig. 219b, i, j; 440a, d, g-o). Macronucleus
subequatorial on average, broadly ellipsoidal, about 15-20 x 10—15 urn in vivo, while only 12
x 8 urn in the silver preparations, indicating considerable shrinkage, as in other members of
the group (FoiSSNER 1993c); nucleoli oblong. Micronucleus tightly attached to macronucleus
and thus likely in its perinuclear space, about 3—4 x 2-3 (im in vivo. Contractile vacuole
extends between oral vertex and body end, as shown by many scattered excretory pores (Fig.
219b, d; 440o, q). Cortex highly flexible and more or less distinctly striated by the ciliary
rows, densely granulated, granules colourless and in short, oblique rows on right side,
scattered on left (Fig. 219h, k). Cytoplasm colourless, often packed with fat globules 1-5 urn
across and up to 10 urn-sized food vacuoles with bacterial remnants. Glides and swims
moderately fast, showing great flexibility when touching obstacles or crawling among organic
debris.
Somatic cilia 7-8 urn long in vivo, arranged on average in 19 distinctly spiralling rows all
commencing around the oral apparatus, those on right side slightly more closely spaced than
those on left; some rows shortened anteriorly and/or posteriorly, especially in excretory pore
area. Kinetids slightly more closely spaced in anterior region of postoral kineties, but a
postoral pseudomembrane is not formed; anterior cilium of dikinetids frequently lacking,
appearing as a minute stub in SEM micrographs (Fig. 219b; 440b, c, e, g-s).
' Silverline pattern as in specimens from USA type material, that is, closely and irregularly
meshed, except in oral area, where an ordinary, platyophryid pattern occurs, that is, two
silverline meshes between each two ciliary rows (Fig. 219 1, m; 440b, c, e, f).
Oral apparatus narrowly crescent-shaped, extends about 20 urn backwards along main body
axis from beak-like anterior body end; oral funnel hardly recognizable in vivo, lined by fine
fibres (Fig. 219b; 440a, d, e, g-j, o, p, s-v). Paroral membrane in flat furrow at right margin
of oral opening, composed of very closely spaced, zigzagging dikinetids producing two
distinctly different ciliary rows: outer (right) paroral row made of about 6 urn long, acicular,
loose cilia beating distinctly in vivo; inner (left) paroral row composed of about 4 urn long,
rod-shaped, likely almost or entirely immobile cilia so close together that a ribbon-like
structure is formed that appears as a broad, bright wall in vivo. On average eight minute
adoral organelles at left mouth margin; distances between individual organelles increase
slightly from proximal to distal. Individual adoral organelles brick-shaped and likely made of
two short ciliary rows in silver nitrate preparations, while composed of a single row of four
rod-shaped cilia in vivo and scanning electron micrographs; cilia increase in length from
approximately 2 urn proximally to about 4 urn distally, a remarkable pattern seen in several
specimens both in vivo and scanning electron micrographs.
1017

Population from Namibian site 3 6 (Fig. 219a, c, d-g; Table 201): This small
population probably represents the lower limit of variability. It developed in a non-flooded
Petri dish culture from the highly saline crust soil near site 39 (Fig. 2). Specimens were
studied in vivo and in rather strongly bleached CHATTON-LWOFF silver nitrate preparations.
Size 70-120 x 20-40 urn in vivo, usually near 100 x 30 urn, stouter in preparations, viz., 85 x
38 urn, possibly due to some contraction and shrinkage; up to 30% contractile under cover glass,
even if not touched, showing characteristic shape changes (Fig. 219e-g). Elongate ellipsoidal

to slightly reniform, anterior end bluntly pointed, posterior often curved leftward and
narrowly to moderately broadly rounded; slightly flattened dorsoventrally (Fig. 219a).
Macronucleus subequatorial on average, globular to ellipsoidal, on average broadly ellipsoi-
dal; nucleolus reticular. Micronucleus not observed. Contractile vacuole extends between
buccal vertex and body end, as shown by many scattered excretory pores (Fig. 219d). Cortex
very flexible, cortical granules less conspicuous than in specimens from site (39). Cytoplasm
colourless, contains some fat globules and food vacuoles with fluffy content. Glides moder-
ately fast on microscope slide and soil particles, showing great flexibility.
Somatic and oral ciliary pattern as described for specimens from site (39), with inconspicuous
morphometric differences (Table 201).
Ontogenesis: Morphogenesis basically proceeds as in other members of the group (-»
Platyophryides latus and FOISSNER 1993c), as is obvious from some main stages found in the
silver and scanning electron microscopic preparations. Division is homothetogenic, pleuro-
kinetal, and proceeds in freely motile (non-encysted) condition. Early-middle dividers show
that cells become ellipsoidal and fully reorganize the parental oral apparatus without,
however, producing an anlagen field ("internal reorganization"; FOISSNER 1996c), while the
new opisthe oral apparatus originates from a subequatorial anlagen field in line with the
proter oral apparatus. Both the adoral organelles and the paroral membrane develop very
early, that is, before cell furrowing commences. However, the four cilia of the adoral
organelles are grouped in two minute rows each comprising two cilia, and the outer (right)
paroral ciliary row develops much later than the inner one (Fig. 441a-c). Middle dividers
show the onset of cell division, accompanied by an about 90° rotation of the opisthe relative
to the proter. Thus, proter and opisthe oral apparatus are now on different sides of the cell and
cannot be seen at the same focal plane. The adoral cilia arrange to a single row and the cilia of
the outer paroral row grow out; accordingly, the oral ciliary pattern is complete at this stage
(Fig. 441a-f). Early post-dividers are globular and of slightly different structure: proter post-
dividers have a wide, flat, crescent-shaped oral opening, while opisthe post-dividers have a
small, circular oral opening with a distinct collar (Fig. 441g-j).
Occurrence and ecology: Reticulowoodruffia terricola was discovered in highly
saline dune sand from the Death Valley, Utah, USA (FOISSNER 1993c). In Namibia, it
occurred in similar, but less saline and sandy habitats, viz., at sites (36) and (39). No other
records are known (FOISSNER 1998a). Reticulowoodruffia terricola lacks specific morpho-
logical adaptations to the soil (sand) environment, except for the pronounced flexibility.
Possibly, evolutionary constraints of the saline habitats the species obviously prefers caused
the unique silverline pattern.
Semiplatyophrya acrostoma nov. spec. (Fig. 220a-m; 442a-i; Table 202)
Diagnosis: Size about 55x15 urn in vivo. Elongate ovoid to distinctly reniform, with
urn wide oral opening occupying narrowed anterior body end. On average 9 somatic ciliary
rows, 9 paroral dikinetids, and 4 adoral organelles each consisting of four basal bodies.
Type location: Highly saline crust soil from the "Moon Landscape" in Namibia, 22°40'S
14°45'E (site 36 in figure 2 and chapter 2.1.2).
1019

Etymology: Composite of the Greek words akron (top of body) and stoma (mouth),
referring to the main species feature, that is, the apical location of the oral opening. Stoma is
used as a noun in apposition and thus does not adjust its neuter gender to the feminine generic
name Platyophrya.
Description: Size 40-70 x 10-20 urn in vivo, rather distinctly contractile and thus
smaller and stouter in preparations (Table 202); contracts and extends slowly, endpoints thus
not exactly to determine. Shape highly variable, elongate ovoid to reniform when fully
extended, more or less distinctly ovoidal or boomerang-shaped when fully or partially
contracted; anterior end, bearing the oral opening, invariably bluntly pointed, posterior
narrowly to broadly rounded (Fig. 220a-c, j-m); laterally flattened up to 2:1. Nuclear
apparatus subequatorial on average. Macronucleus globular to slightly ellipsoidal, contains
pale nucleoli. Micronucleus in vivo close to macronucleus, likely in its perinuclear space
because not recognizable in silver carbonate preparations. Contractile vacuole in rear body
end, excretory pore in or near posterior pole centre. Cortex very flexible, contains many about
0.5 um-sized, colourless granules, very likely mucocysts, in same pattern as silverline system
(Fig. 220e, f). Cytoplasm rather hyaline, contains up to 3 um-sized fat globules and a few
food vacuoles with fluffy content. Glides rather rapidly on microscope slide and soil particles
showing great flexibility; moves like a fast, small amoebae under strong cover-glass pressure.
Somatic cilia only about 5 urn long in vivo, paired on right side, mostly single on left. On
average nine curved to slightly spiralized, bipolar somatic kineties, those on right side slightly
narrower spaced and about twice as densely ciliated than those on left (Fig. 220a, h-m; 422a,
e, g-i; Table 202). In some specimens, a single dikinetid between anterior ends of left side
kineties, forming some sort of postoral pseudomembrane (Fig. 220g; 422b). Silverlines in
Colpoda pattern in right, dorsal and ventral cortex, while a Platyophrya pattern is formed
between three to four left side ciliary rows, with the median silverline sometimes neighboured
the left side of the kinety. Individual silverlines often strongly undulating and slightly
narrower spaced than somatic kinetids (Fig. 220h-m; 422c, d, h, i).
Oral apparatus occupies narrowed anterior body end, minute, that is, merely 3-5 urn across
and thus in vivo recognizable only in strongly squeezed and flattened cells (Fig. 220a-d, i-k;
442a, b, e-h). Paroral membrane distinctly curved, composed of an average of nine dikinetids,
each having an about 3 urn long cilium associated likely with the distal basal body. Adoral
organelles at left mouth margin, bear inconspicuous, almost immobile, about 3 urn long
ciliary tufts curved posteriorly and to mouth centre; individual organelles composed of four
basal bodies, of which one or two are likely unciliated, as indicated by the fineness of the
tufts. Pharyngeal structures recognizable neither in vivo nor in silver carbonate preparations.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location, where it was rather
abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. The site is moderately saline and likely rather
similar to that where S. foissneri was discovered, viz., in saline soil from the Sinai coast,
Israel. Likely, Semiplatyophrya has a preference for saline soils.
Comparison with related species: See FOISSNER( 1993c) for a detailed description
of all taxa mentioned in the following discussion. Cyrtolophosidid colpodids like S. acro-
stoma are difficult to identify because they are small and have ordinary oral structures. The
present species came to our attention by the minute and apically located oral apparatus and
the terminally situated contractile vacuole. While the oral apparatus is minute and near the apical

end also in some small Platyophrya species, the contractile vacuole is subterminal. Sagittaria
species have, like S. acrostoma, a polar oral opening and a terminal contractile vacuole, but
are stout, unflattened organisms. However, all these and some other species are so similar in
shape and size that only very experienced workers will be able to distinguish them in vivo.
Thus, silver impregnation is indispensable to look for the presence/absence of a postoral
pseudomembrane and, especially, the silverline pattern, which is colpodid in Sagittaria.
Semiplatyophrya is unique in having a Colpoda silverline pattern on the right side and a
Platyophrya pattern on the left.
Semiplatyophrya acrostoma differs from 5. foissneri, type and as yet sole species of the
genus, mainly by the apical location of the oral opening. In the two populations of S. foissneri
studied so far, the oral opening is larger and subapical on the ventral side. Furthermore, the
adoral organelles are larger, that is, consist of six to nine basal bodies vs. only four in S.
acrostoma. All other features and the habitats are very similar in both species (FOISSNER
1993c).
Pseudokreyella FOISSNER, 1985
Pseudokreyella belongs to the family Tectohymenidae FOISSNER, 1993c, a highly aberrant
group of soil colpodids as yet comprising only two genera with three species altogether;
1022

however, most species of this group are still undiscovered because they are small, infrequent,
and hardly ever reach high abundances. Thus, we are happy to report on a further "good"
Pseudokreyella species, where we could clear the structure of the paroral membrane which,
according to FOISSNER'S genus diagnosis "consists of a single row of dikinetids or mono-
kinetids". The excellent preparations from —» P. etoschensis show clearly that the paroral
consists of dikinetids which, however, may appear as monokinetids depending on the angles
by which the membrane is viewed; as the membrane becomes more or less distinctly twisted
due to its U-like shape, an observer usually sees a more or less large portion in profile, where
the obliquely arranged dikinetids appear as elliptical monokinetids (Fig. 221b, c; 443a-i).
Accordingly, the genus diagnosis can be improved as follows: "Very small Tectohymenidae
with dikinetidal paroral membrane". The second genus of the family, Tectohymena FOISSNER,
1993c has a conspicuous field of paroral kineties.
Pseudokreyella etoschensis nov. spec. (Fig. 221a-e; 443a-k; Table 203)
Diagnosis: Size about 20x18 urn in vivo; ovoid. Somatic kinety 1 composed of
ordinarily spaced kinetids. Three adoral organelles, organelle 1 minute and distinctly
separated from almost abutting organelles 2 and 3, each composed of three vertically
orientated basal body row.
Type location: Highly saline soil from margin of Etosha Pan, Namibia, 19°S 15°50'E
(site 54 in figures 2, 3 and chapter 2.1.2).
Etymology: Named after the region discovered.
Description: Size 25-40 x 15-25 urn in vivo, usually about 30 x 18 urn. In lateral view
ovoid with dorsal margin more distinctly convex than ventral, dorsal and ventral view
ellipsoidal because cells laterally flattened about 1.5:1 (Fig. 221a, b, e). Nuclear apparatus in
posterior half of cell, usually neighboured ventral side. Macronucleus globular, contains some
large nucleoli. Micronucleus slightly flattened, attached to macronucleus. Contractile vacuole
in posterior body end; excretory pore and cytopyge not impregnated. Cortex flexible, without
specific granules, slightly furrowed by ciliary rows, especially preorally. Cytoplasm hyaline,
contains up to 5 um-sized food vacuoles with bacterial remnants. Glides rather rapidly on
microscope slide and soil particles.
Cilia about 8 urn long and paired throughout, usually arranged in 10 rather sparsely ciliated
rows, about half of which commence postorally and along preoral suture. Kinetids closely
spaced in distinctly curved anterior portion of rows 1-3, those of rows 1 and 2 additionally
obliquely arranged; row 2 with wide break in mid-portion (Fig. 221a, b, e; 443a, d, f, j).
Oral apparatus in second quarter of cell, conspicuous in silver preparations, while inconspicu-
ous in vivo because oral structures almost entirely covered by U-shaped roof of buccal cavity.
Buccal cavity deepening from anterior to posterior, guides into an inconspicuous pharyngeal
basket commencing at right margin of last adoral organelle (Fig. 221a, b; 443j). Paroral
membrane U-shaped, composed of (ciliated?) dikinetids, middle portion appears monokineti-
dal, as explained in genus introduction, because seen in profile when specimen is viewed
ventrally; at right end a short, third row of basal bodies in about one third of specimens (Fig.

443h); at anterior end invariably a single dikinetid separated from other paroral dikinetids by
a slightly increased distance. This kinetid, which is near the right end of the anterior portion
of somatic kinety 1, is at an intermediate focal plane, and thus we could not decide whether it
belongs to kinety 1 or the paroral. Three adoral organelles form a narrow, slightly twisted
ciliary plate on left wall of buccal cavity: organelle 1 minute consisting of only three to four
cilia; organelles 2 and 3 almost abutting, each composed of three vertical basal body rows; at
posterior end of organelle 3 some additional basal bodies, possibly representing a minute
fourth organelle (Fig. 221a-d; 443a-k).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type location. Pseudokreyella
etoschensis is the first member of the family Hying in saline soil.
1024

Comparison with related species: Pseudokreyelia etoschensis differs from P.
terricola by the number (3 vs. 4-5) and structure (3 vs. 5-7 vertical rows of basal bodies in
last organelle) of the adoral organelles and the distinct gap in kinety 2. Pseudokreyelia
australis has four distinct adoral organelles and a conspicuous condensation of cilia in the
middle portion of somatic kinety 1. Thus, P. etoschensis is a very distinct species easily
identified in silver preparations. In vivo, however, it may be confused with the congeners and
other small colpodids because all features are difficult to recognize due to the minuteness of
the organism. See FoiSSNER (1993c) for a detailed description of all species mentioned.
