Abstract
We examined tintinnid (loricate ciliate microzooplankton) diversity using data from 11 stations between the
Moroccan upwelling system and the oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean. Taxonomic and morphological diversity of
tintinnidswascomparedtophytoplanktondistributionandsize-structure,totheabundanceofcompetitorsintheform
