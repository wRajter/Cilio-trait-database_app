Species of the genus Coleps are one of the most common planktonic ciliates in lake ecosystems. The
study aimed to identify the phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability of different Coleps isolates
from various water bodies and from culture collections. We used an integrative approach to study the
strains by (i) cultivation in a suitable culture medium, (ii) screening of the morphological variability
including the presence/absence of algal endosymbionts of living cells by light microscopy, (iii)
sequencing of the SSU and ITS rDNA including secondary structures, (iv) assessment of their seasonal
and spatial occurrence in two lakes over a one‑year cycle both from morphospecies counts and high‑
throughput sequencing (HTS), and, (v) proof of the co‑occurrence of Coleps and their endosymbiotic
algae from HTS‑based network analyses in the two lakes. The Coleps strains showed a high phenotypic
plasticity and low genetic variability. The algal endosymbiont in all studied strains was Micractinium
conductrix and the mutualistic relationship turned out as facultative. Coleps is common in both lakes
over the whole year in different depths and HTS has revealed that only one genotype respectively one
species, C. viridis, was present in both lakes despite the different lifestyles (mixotrophic with green
algal endosymbionts or heterotrophic without algae). Our results suggest a future revision of the
species concept of the genus Coleps.
Ciliates of the genus Coleps Nitzsch, 1827 are widely distributed in diverse marine, brackish and freshwater
habitats1–11. Currently, more than 20 morphological species originally assigned to Coleps, have been described
since the first report of C. hirtus, the type species12. Later, most of them have been transferred to new genera
(see details in Table S1). Colepids are morphologically relatively easily recognized due to their armored calcium
carbonate plates that are characteristic for their overall appearance1,13 (Fig. 1). Diagnostic features for the dif-
ferentiation of colepid species, which were used for descriptions of genera, are the number of the armor tiers, the
structure of the tier plates, the presence/absence of armor spines, and the number of adoral o rganelles12. These
morphological traits were also used for the subdivision of colepids into several genera (for detailed summary
and morphological definition of the genera; s ee12,14,15). As a result of the subdivision into genera (Table S1), only
five described morphospecies remained in the genus Coleps: C. amphacanthus Ehrenberg, 1 83316–20, C. elongatus
Ehrenberg, 1 8311,21, C. hirtus Nitzsch, 18271,22, C. viridis Ehrenberg, 18311, and C. spetai Foissner, 198412.

In freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds, four colepid species can be frequently found even within
the same water body1–4,23–27, i.e., C. hirtus hirtus, C. hirtus viridis, C. spetai and Nolandia nolandi Kahl, 1930 (=
formerly C. nolandi). The morphology of these species is very similar except for the structure of the tier plates,
i.e., the pretzel-shaped hirtus-type in the three former and the reniform nolandi-type in the latter species12,16
(Fig. 1P–S). Coleps hirtus hirtus and Nolandia nolandi are considered to be heterotrophic omnivores, whereas
C. hirtus viridis and C. spetai are known to be mixotrophic because they bear endosymbiotic green algae (for
an ecological summary on the four species, see Foissner et al.1). The latter two are so far separated by wing-
like protrusions that occur as conspicuous structures in C. spetai only (Fig. 1N–O), whereas both C. hirtus
subspecies can be distinguished by the grass-green appearance in C. hirtus viridis caused by the possession of
endosymbionts22. Moreover, the presence of armor spines has as well been considered as a genus-specific feature
in both Coleps and Nolandia12.
Phylogenetic analyses of the Prostomatea using SSU rDNA sequences demonstrated that the colepid taxa
represented a monophyletic lineage although the generic concept within this group is questionable7,9,28. Even the
species belonging to Coleps in the revision of Foissner et al.12 are not members of the same clade. For example, C.

Table 1. Morphological features of the investigated strains compared to those of Coleps hirtus (color-coded in
blue) and C. spetai (colour-coded in green) according to F oissner22. Constant and divergent features are marked
in white and orange, respectively.
amphacanthus is closely related to the genus Levicoleps12, whereas C. hirtus and C. spetai are sisters of Nolandia
nolandi9.
To discover the cryptic diversity within colepid species, Barth et al.29 studied the genetic variability of C.
hirtus, C. spetai and Nolandia nolandi by comparing their mitochondrial apocytochrome b gene. The authors
analyzed 111 isolates and revealed a high genetic intraspecific diversity within C. hirtus hirtus (9 haplotypes)
and C. spetai (11 haplotypes) with a clear separation into hetero- and mixotrophic morphotypes and a sister
to Nolandia nolandi (3 haplotypes). Cryptic diversity has also been reported for other ciliates (peritrichs30,31;
t intinnids32; h eterotrichs33).
However, the phenotypic morphological plasticity of the colepid ciliates as well as the stability of the endos-
ymbiosis with their green algal partners (facultative or obligate) was not investigated so far. Very little is known
about the identity of green algal endosymbionts in ciliates or even protists and for convenience, they were usually
designated as zoochlorellae (see Foissner et al.1, for a compilation of algal-bearing planktonic ciliates). Pröschold
et al.34 investigated one algal strain, which was isolated from C. hirtus and its SSU/ITS rDNA sequence was
identical with the green alga Chlorella vulgaris, that is frequently found free-living as well as in symbiosis with
other ciliates such as Paramecium bursaria. Interestingly, the mutualistic relationship among P. bursaria and
its algal symbiont is flexible indicating that the ciliate can establish a symbiosis also with ‘foreign’ green algae
derived from other ciliates35. This flexibility has been also described for an unidentified species of the marine
colepid genus Tiarina, which bears several cryptic algal species of the genus Zooxanthella (previously known as
Symbiodinium clade A) as endosymbionts36.
During a one-year sampling campaign, Coleps spp. were regularly found in the plankton of Lake Mondsee
(Austria) and Lake Zurich (Switzerland). According to morphological discrepancies especially in the collected
Coleps specimens compared to those of described species, we performed an integrative approach to gain a deeper
insight into the ciliates as well as their endosymbionts and, moreover, the stability of the symbiosis. Through-
out different seasons and from different depths, we isolated several Coleps strains with and without green algal
endosymbionts and compared them to cultivated strains previously collected from other sites. We established
clonal cultures of both the ciliates and the green algae (in the case of algal-bearing strains) and investigated (i)
their morphology and (ii) their molecular sequences (from single cells as well as from HTS), (iii) the facultative
or obligate nature of the association among the partners, (iv) their ecological preferences (co-occurrence), and,
finally, (v) their seasonal and spatial distribution in the two lakes.
Results
Systematics and molecular phylogeny of Coleps. Morphology and phenotypic plasticity. Among the
clone cultures, we found a broad spectrum of morphological variations (Table 1 + S2). Out of 19 clones compris-
ing several Coleps strains and one clone of Nolandia nolandi, only two could be assigned at the morphospecies
level following to the identification key of Foissner et al.1. All others showed more than 20% variation among the
investigated individual clones according to their morphometric features and made a final identification ques-
tionable (Table 1). The features which fit to the descriptions of C. hirtus and C. spetai, were marked in blue and
green in Table 1, respectively (constant features and differing characters are highlighted in white and in orange,
respectively). The phenotypic plasticity was high among the strains, which can be seen in pie charts in Fig. 3 by
the color-coding. In detail, the number of plate rings in the anterior and posterior primary and secondary plates

◂Figure 2. Molecular phylogeny of the Colepidae (Prostomatea) based on SSU sequence comparisons. The
phylogenetic trees shown were inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on the data sets (1750
aligned positions of 34 taxa) using PAUP 4.0a166. For the analyses, the best model was calculated by Modeltest
3.7. The setting of the best model was given as follows: GTR + I + G (base frequencies: A 0.2796, C 0.1881, G
0.2526, T 0.2797; rate matrix A–C 1.0338, A–G 2.5616, A–U 1.2578, C–G 0.4974, C–U 4.5509, G–U 1.0000)
with the proportion of invariable sites (I = 0.6535) and gamma shape parameter (G = 0.6457). The branches in
bold are highly supported in all analyses (Bayesian values > 0.95 calculated with MrBayes, 5 million generations;
bootstrap values > 70%, calculated with PAUP, 1000 replicates using maximum likelihood, neighbour-joining,
and maximum parsimony). The branch marked with a hashtag was not supported in our analyses. The new
sequences of this study are marked with an asterisk. The mixotrophic (with green algal endosymbionts) and
heterotrophic (without algal endosymbionts) strains of Coleps are highlighted with green and blue circles,

was largely constant, the number of plate windows in the anterior and posterior secondary plates varied even
within one individual, the shape of the plate windows corresponded to the hirtus-type and the nolandia-type,
respectively, and, the number and presence/absence of anterior and posterior armour spines differed or they
were absent at all (Fig. 1). The same was true for N. nolandi, variations in the number of plate windows and the
presence/absence of anterior/posterior armour spines did not correspond to the description.
SSU phylogeny of the Colepidae (Prostomatea). The SSU and ITS rDNA of the nuclear ribosomal operon were
sequenced to infer the genetic variability of the investigated strains. The SSU rDNA sequences were aligned
according to the secondary structure (exemplarily presented for the strain CCAP 1613/7; Fig. S1) and incorpo-
rated into a dataset, which included all morphologically described representatives of the Colepidae (Prostoma-
tea; Fig. 2). Our clonal strains (except for strain CCAP 1613/15 = Nolandia nolandi) could be assigned to two
genetic groups, i.e., group 1 and group 2 (Fig. 2). The strain CCAP 1613/15 is almost identical (99.8%) to the
SSU rDNA sequence of N. nolandi obtained by Barth et al.29. Group 1 includes strains with and without green
algal endosymbionts (indicated by green and blue circles in Fig. 2, respectively). Only strain CCAP 1613/14 is
identical with the SSU rDNA sequence of C. hirtus hirtus (Genbank accession number AM29231129) and repre-
sents group 2. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that strains that were morphologically identified as C. hirtus
and C. spetai could be found in both genetic groups. The only other already sequenced Coleps species, i.e., C.
amphacanthus was not closely related to the others and genetically belonged to the genus Levicoleps. In addition,
the other colepid genera, i.e., Nolandia, Pinacocoleps and Levicoleps that were represented by more than one
species appeared to be also not monophyletic in our analyses and were intertwined with the genus Tiarina. Our
findings are highly supported in all bootstrap and Bayesian analyses. Only one clade marked with a hashtag in
Fig. 2 remained unresolved.
ITS phylogeny and ITS‑2/CBC approach. To decide if the two genetic groups 1 and 2 represented species, the
ITS regions of the nuclear ribosomal operon were analyzed. First, the ITS-1 and ITS-2 were aligned accord-
ing to their secondary structures and a phylogenetic tree was calculated using the methods described below.
Second, the ITS-2 secondary structures were compared using the ITS-2/CBC approach to detect compensatory
base changes (CBCs) between the groups 1 and 2. The phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3) supported the subdivision
into the two groups. The ITS-1 and ITS-2 of the investigated Coleps strains had a length of ~ 165 bp and ~ 210
bp, respectively, and revealed differences to the typical secondary structures presented by Coleman & Mai37 for
green algae and plants, but similarity to the structure of Tetrahymena tropicalis38. The ITS-1 of Coleps formed
only one helix and the ITS-2 missed the helix I but the helices II–IV were present (Fig. 4). The comparison of
ITS-1 and ITS-2 secondary structures revealed that the two groups did not only differ in their structures, but also
a CBC in helix II of the ITS-2 (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 4) could be observed, suggesting that both groups
represented two separate species (Figs. 3 and 4). In an additional step, we tested if the two putative species could
also be separated by HTS of the V9 SSU rDNA region, which is commonly used in metabarcoding s tudies39,40.
Therefore, we checked the secondary structure of the investigated groups to detect their usage as marker for
HTS. In Fig. 5, we demonstrated that each V9 region of the used sequences had a diagnostic part in its structure
(highlighted in white).
Systematics and molecular phylogeny of the green algal endosymbionts. Morphology and phe‑
notypic plasticity of the green algal endosymbiont. Six Coleps strains belonging to group 1 had green algal en-
dosymbionts with a Chlorella-like morphology (Figs. 2, 6). These unicellular green algae were characterized by
a spherical to slightly ellipsoid cell shape possessing cup-shaped chloroplasts containing a single pyrenoid sur-
rounded by two or four starch grains. The cells were 7–12 μm in diameter and reproduced asexually by 2–8 au-
tospores. The isolated endosymbionts of three Coleps strains (CCAP 1613/7, CIL-2017/13 and CCAP 1613/11)
did not vary in their morphological features and resembled the appearance of Micractinium (Fig. 6). The mor-
phology of the isolated endosymbionts was identical to those described for M. conductrix in Pröschold et al.34.
SSU and ITS phylogeny of the Chlorellaceae. The SSU and ITS rDNA sequences of the endosymbiotic algal
strains were aligned according to their secondary structures and incorporated into a dataset containing rep-
resentatives of the Chlorellaceae (Trebouxiophyceae). The sequences of all three strains (CCAP 248/18, CCAP
248/19, and CCAP 248/20) were almost identical (99.7%) to the strains SAG 241.80 and CCAP 211/83 (marked
with an asterisk in Fig. 7) that belong to Micractinium conductrix, a species exclusively known as endosymbiont

of Paramecium bursaria34 so far. All SSU and ITS rDNA sequences of M. conductrix had an intron at position 651
and varied in only seven base positions from each other (data not shown).
Seasonal and spatial distribution of Coleps in two lakes. Coleps morphotypes were found through-
out the whole sampling period in Lake Mondsee in higher average numbers than in Lake Zurich (103 vs. 39
cells/L; Figs. 8, S2). Cell numbers peaked during spring and summer in Lake Mondsee, while in Lake Zurich
the maximum abundance was observed once in August (Figs. 8 + S2). Algal-bearing Coleps morphotypes were
mainly detected in the upper meters in both lakes (>80% of total Coleps abundance) whereas the heterotrophic
ones were only found in the deepest zones (Fig. S2). Coleps morphotypes without algal endosymbionts were
frequently found in Lake Zurich during summer but rarely in Lake Mondsee (20% vs. 1% of total abundance;
Fig. S2). In contrast to Lake Zurich, a clear seasonal distribution pattern appeared among depths in Lake Mond-
see. The mixotrophic Coleps morphotypes were more abundant during spring and summer at 5 m depth, in
contrast to the deeper water layer during the cold season (Fig. S2).
The abundance patterns obtained from morphotype-observations of Coleps in both lakes were compared to
HTS read counts of Coleps V9 sequences. In deeper layers, Coleps reads were one order of magnitude higher in
Lake Mondsee than in Lake Zurich. In 5 m depth, Coleps reads were almost two orders of magnitude higher in
Lake Mondsee than in Lake Zurich. From spring till the end of autumn, the abundance of Coleps reads notably
increased in the 5 m depth of Lake Mondsee but decreased during winter. No seasonal succession pattern could
be observed for Coleps reads in the deeper layers of Lake Mondsee. By contrast, seasonal Coleps read abundances
were very similar in both layers of Lake Zurich, with a pronounced simultaneous peak in summer and another
small peak in spring. Similar to Lake Mondsee, Coleps read abundances were lowest during winter in Lake Zurich.
Co‑occurrence networks. In the co-occurrence networks based on HTS-data of the two depths in both
lakes, we only found Coleps group 1 (i.e., C. viridis) and not group 2 (i.e.,C. hirtus; see below). Moreover, we
identified a significant relationship between the symbiotic green alga M. conductrix and C. viridis only in Lake
Mondsee (Fig. 9). Apart from M. conductrix, significant correlations in Lake Mondsee were discovered with
one cryptophyte (Plagioselmis nannoplanctica), one dinoflagellate (Gymnodinium/Peridinium) and several cili-
ates (Cinetochilum margaritaceum, Spathidium stammeri, Tintinnidium cf. primitivum). In Lake Zurich, hetero-
trophic and autotrophic flagellates (Chrysochromulina parva, Goniomonas truncata, Kathablepharis sp.), cerco-
zoa (some uncultured ones and Protaspis grandis), stramenopiles (uncultured Labyrinthulomycetes) and one
ciliate (Cyclidium glaucoma) were detected as significant co-occurring protists along with C. viridis (Fig. 9).
Discussion
Morphology and phenotypic plasticity. The morphological features of the investigated colepid
strains differed from those described for C. hirtus, C. spetai and even for N. nolandi1 (Fig. 1). Characteristics
that matched the descriptions were the ciliate cell length and width, the barrel-shaped cell (except for strain
CIL-2017/7, which was pear-shaped and strain CCAP 1613/15 that had a cylindrical shape), a number of six
armor tiers, the structure of the armor tiers (hirtus-type or nolandia-type, respectively), and one caudal cilium
(Table S2). Variations (CV > 20%) were found (i) in the number of plate windows in the posterior/anterior main
plates even within individual cells, and (ii) in the presence/absence of anterior and posterior spines (Tables 1 +
S2, Fig. 1). This phenotypic plasticity of the ciliate could also be observed in freshly collected Coleps specimens
and was therefore not an artifact resulting from cultivation conditions (Fig. 1A). Wickham and G ugenberger43
hypothesized that the formation of the spines was a response to grazing pressure on C. hirtus; however, this could
not be confirmed by respective experiments. Nevertheless, spineless specimens of C. hirtus have obviously been
found before44–47. Luckily, we were able to investigate two strains (CCAP 1613/1 and CCAP 1613/2) that had
been kept in the CCAP culture collection since the 1950ies and the 1960ies and which did not bear any spines
or symbionts and could be clearly assigned to C. hirtus (Fig. 1T–V). These observations suggest that without
predation pressure, colepid ciliates probably do not need to synthesize spines avoiding ingestion by a predator.
The presence/absence of green algal endosymbionts, one of the diagnostic features for the discrimination
among C. hirtus subspecies and C. spetai, was also not a stable feature (Table S2). Under culture conditions, some
strains lost their endosymbionts completely, other strains consisted of symbiotic and aposymbiotic individuals,
and some strains showed only symbiont-bearing individuals (e.g., CCAP 1613/5 and CIL-2017/6). This indicates
that the symbiosis is facultative and might be probably influenced by cultivation or environmental conditions
(presumably, though not tested, food availability). Consequently, the morphological separation of C. hirtus into

the two subspecies may no longer be valid. We clearly demonstrated that the morphological features used for
species descriptions can vary and have severe consequences for colepid species identification. Moreover, even
the strains belonging to the groups 1 and 2 discovered by the phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2) cannot discriminate
morphotypes because they can neither be assigned to a certain cell morphology nor to the possession of algal
endosymbionts. This questions the traditional morphology-based taxonomy. The separation of Coleps hirtus
hirtus, C. hirtus viridis and C. spetai, which Foissner et al.1 differentiated by the presence of zoochlorellae in
the latter two species and the number of windows in the armor plates, could not be supported by our analyses.
C. hirtus viridis was originally described by Ehrenberg48,49 as C. viridis and later transferred as synonym of C.
hirtus by Kahl50 based on almost identical morphological features. However, Foissner22 described C. spetai for
the green Coleps because of the morphological discrepancies to the Ehrenberg’s C. viridis (presence of only 11
windows per plate row and smaller cell size in C. viridis; see Table 1 for comparison). Our study has clearly
demonstrated that most of the morphological features are variable and the limits for species separation were too
narrow. Therefore, we propose the re-establishment of C. viridis for group 1 and C. hirtus for group 2, both with
emended descriptions as follows. Considering our findings, the morphological descriptions of C. spetai, C. hirtus
viridis and C. hirtus hirtus cannot be applied for (sub-) species separation any more. Consequently, we deal with
a cryptic species complex, i.e., two genetically different groups that are fused in a highly variable morphotype
including features of all three (sub-) species. To solve this taxonomic problem, two possible scenarios can be
proposed: (1) We merge the three morphotypes under C. hirtus, the type species of Coleps. As a consequence,
two new species needed to be proposed for both groups 1 and 2, which could be done following the suggestion
of Sonneborn51 for the P. aurelia-complex. However, Sonneborn based his new descriptions on results of mat-
ing experiments, which are not applicable for Coleps here because conjugations have not been reported and the
conditions for the induction of sexual reproduction are unknown. (2) To avoid confusion by introducing new

species names, we propose keeping the already existing names, i.e., C. viridis for group 1 and C. hirtus for group
2 including the synonyms (see below).
Clonal cultures of both genetically varying Coleps groups have been deposited in the CCAP culture collec-
tion. Future studies may therefore be able to investigate, for example, sibling among strains or predator-prey
experiments revealing spine- or wing-formation.

Molecular phylogeny of the Colepidae (Prostomatea). The colepids belonging to the Prostomatea
form a monophyletic lineage in the phylogenetic analyses of SSU rDNA sequences (Fig. 2). Mixotrophic as
well as heterotrophic Coleps strains that resembled C. hirtus and C. spetai clustered in group 1 whereas group 2
included only two specimens which were identified as C. hirtus. These findings confirm the results of Barth et
al.29 with one exception. The authors found a clear separation into mixotrophic and heterotrophic species, which
were therefore assigned to a C. spetai-(with endosymbionts) and a C. hirtus-group (without endosymbionts),
respectively. Despite the difficulties of identifying these species by morphology, both groups clearly differed in
their SSU and ITS rDNA sequences (Fig. 3). The ITS-2/CBC approach introduced for green algae (details in
Darienko et al.52) clearly demonstrated that both groups represented two separate ciliate species from a molecu-
lar point of view, which was also confirmed by analyses of the V9 region of the SSU, a region commonly used for
metabarcoding (Figs. 4 and 5).
Our study also confirmed the findings of Chen et al.7, Lu et al.9, and Moon et al.28, showing that the generic
concept of colepid ciliates needs to be revised. None of the genera represented by more than one species is
monophyletic. For example, the three species of Nolandia belonged to separate lineages. Nolandia nolandi was
a sister to our studied strains, whereas both other species were closely related to taxa of Apocoleps, Pinacocoleps,
and Tiarina (Fig. 2). The genus Levicoleps and Coleps amphacanthus formed a monophyletic clade representing

another example that the generic conception is artificial and needs to be revised. However, to provide a new
generic concept of colepid ciliates, it is necessary to study more of the described species by using an integrative
approach including experimental approaches on, e.g., the formation of spines. For example, we clearly demon-
strated that one key feature, which is the presence/absence of anterior/posterior spines, is highly variable and
can therefore not be used to separate colepid genera as indicated by Foissner et al.12 (Fig. 1). There is a need for
more experimental studies with colepids belonging to the Cyclidium viridis and C. hirtus morphotype. Therefore,
we deposited all clones used in this study in the CCAP culture collection. One option would be to incorporate
all species into one genus, i.e., Coleps in revised form.
Endosymbiosis in Coleps. Some strains of Coleps are known to bear green algal endosymbionts1. These
green algae have Chlorella-like morphology (Fig. 6) and were identified as Micractinium conductrix (Fig. 7). So
far, this alga was only known as endosymbiont of the ciliate Paramecium bursaria34. All green algal endosym-
bionts of Coleps harbored this Micractinium species. In contrast, Pröschold et al.34 found that one ciliate strain
identified as C. hirtus viridis had Chlorella vulgaris as endosymbiont (the algae has been deposited in the Culture
Collection of Algae and Protozoa under the number CCAP 211/111). Unfortunately, this ciliate strain is not
available anymore53.
Ecology and distribution. For limnological studies, the preservation with Bouin’s solution and QPS is
an appropriate method for quantifying and identifying ciliate species in environmental s amples54. However,
the quality in characterization of ciliates at the species level is sometimes limited as, in case of Coleps, the char-
acteristic armored calcium carbonate plates are dissolved by the acidified fixation solution. Therefore, in our
study, we could only distinguish between algal-bearing (mixotrophic) and non-algal-bearing (heterotrophic)
Coleps. Despite that limitation, we could clearly see that the heterotrophic ones were only found in the deep-
est zones of both lakes (Fig. 8A). Not surprisingly, Coleps is often observed in nutrient- and ion-rich and also
oxygen-depleted freshwater habitats or areas, e.g., sulfurous and crater l akes1,5,6,27,55,56 or even in the sludge of
wastewater treatment plants57. Mixotrophic individuals of Coleps were mainly found in the upper layers of both
lakes, whereas in Lake Mondsee we could also detect specimens down to 40 m depth (Fig. 8). In contrast to the
mero- and monomictic Lake Zurich4,10,58,59, Lake Mondsee is holo- and d imictic60. During mixis events, algal-
bearing Coleps specimens can be transferred passively from the upper layers into the deeper zones and vice versa.
Although morphotype countings and HTS analyses reads matched quite well, we found discrepancies that have
already been discussed before10,61 (Fig. S2).

Biogeographic aspects (haplotype network). Our metabarcoding approach showed that C. viridis was
found in both lakes as a common ciliate (Fig. S2). In contrast, C. hirtus could not be detected during the sam-
pling period. To obtain more information about the distribution of both species, we used the BLASTn search
algorithm62 (100 coverage, >97% identity) for the V4 and the V9 regions of the SSU and the ITS-2 sequences.
No records using the V9 and the ITS-2 approaches could be discovered in GenBank, but 25 reference sequences
using the V4 (Table S3). Together with the newly sequenced strains, we therefore constructed a V4 haplotype
network (Fig. 10). Both groups are obviously widely distributed and subdivided into five (group 1) and four
(group 2) haplotypes, respectively. All reference sequences were collected from freshwater habitats except for
two marine records63 (EU446361 and EU446396; Mediterranean Sea) and showed no geographical preferences.
Co‑occurrence networks. In the sub-networks of C. viridis in both lakes, we found several significant cor-
relations that pointed to either potential prey items, e.g., diverse flagellated autotrophic or heterotrophic protists
or co-occurring ciliates (Fig. 9). Also, the smaller ciliates such as Cinetochilum margaritaceum or Cyclidium glau‑
coma may as well be considered as food for the omnivorous C. viridis (for a compilation of the food spectrum;
see Foissner et al.1). However, we identified the endosymbiont M. conductrix and its host C. viridis from both
sub-networks of Lake Mondsee but not of Lake Zurich (Fig. 9). Despite this result, we want to point out that we
may probably not find M. conductrix free-living in a water body because outside their ciliate host the algae were
immediately attacked and killed by so-called Chlorella-viruses66. Therefore, the HTS-detection of M. conductrix
was probably only together with a host ciliate. This might further explain why the green algae were detected in
Lake Mondsee even in the aphotic 40 m zone where photosynthesis was impossible and individuals probably
passively transferred into the deeper area by lake mixis.
Outlook. As demonstrated in our study, the combination of traditional morphological investigations, which
includes the phenotypic plasticity of the cloned strains, and modern molecular analyses using both SSU and ITS
sequencing as well as HTS approaches advise a taxonomic revision of the genus Coleps. This comprehensive and
integrative approach is also applicable for other ciliate species and genera and will provide new insights into the
ecology and evolution of this important group of protists.
Experimental procedures. Study sites, lake sampling and origin of the Coleps strains. Our main study
sites were Lake Mondsee (Austria) and Lake Zurich (Switzerland), two pre-alpine oligo-mesotrophic lakes that
were sampled at the deepest point of each lake (Table S4). Water samples were taken monthly from June 2016
through May 2017 over the whole water column and additionally biweekly at two main depths, i.e., 5 m in both
lakes, 40 m in Lake Mondsee, and 120 m in Lake Zurich, respectively. A 5-L-Ruttner water sampler was used for
Lake Zurich and a 10-L-Schindler-Patalas sampler (both from Uwitec, Austria) for Lake Mondsee. Twelve Coleps
strains were isolated from Lake Mondsee and one from Lake Zurich. Another six clones could be obtained either
from already successfully cultivated own strains, fresh isolates or from culture collections. Detailed information
about sampling sites, dates and strain numbers is given in Table S2.
Seasonal and spatial distribution and abundance. For quantification, subsamples (200-300 mL) were preserved
with Bouin’s solution (5% f.c.) containing 15 parts of picric acid, 5 parts of formaldehyde (37%) and 1 part
of glacial acetic acid54. The samples were filtered through 0.8 μm cellulose nitrate filters (Sartorius, Germany)
equipped with counting grids. The ciliates were stained following the protocol of the quantitative protargol
staining (QPS) method after S kibbe54 with slight modifications after Pfister et al.67. The permanent slides were
analyzed by light microscopy up to 1600x magnification with a Zeiss Axio Imager.M1 and an Olympus BX51
microscope. For identification of Coleps and Nolandia cells, the identification key of Foissner et al.1 was used.
Microphotographs were taken with a ProgRes C14 plus camera using the ProgRes Capture Pro imaging system
(version 2.9.0.1, Jenoptik, Jena, Germany).
Cloning, identification and cultivation of ciliates and endosymbionts. Single cells of Coleps were isolated and
washed using the Pasteur pipette method68. The isolated strains were cultivated in 400 μl modified Woods Hole
medium69 (MWC; modified) and Volvic mineral water in a mixture of 5:1 and with the addition of 10 μl of an
algal culture (Cryptomonas sp., strain SAG 26.80) as food in microtiter plates. These clonal cultures were trans-
ferred into larger volumes after successful enrichment. All cultures were maintained at 15–21 °C under a light:
dark cycle of 12:12 h (photon flux rate up 50 mol m−2 s−1).
For the isolation of their green algal endosymbionts, single ciliates were washed again and transferred into
fresh MWC medium. After starvation and digestion of any food, after approx. 24 hrs, cells were washed again
and the ciliates transferred onto agar plates containing Basal Medium with Beef Extract (ESFl; medium 1a in
Schlösser70). Before placement of the ciliates onto agar plates, 50 μm of an antibiotic mix (mixture of 1% penicil-
lin G, 0.25% streptomycin, and 0.25% chloramphenicol) were added to prevent bacterial growth. The agar plates
were kept under the same conditions as described. After growth (6–8 weeks), the algal colonies were transferred
onto agar slopes (1.5%) containing ESFl medium and kept under the described culture conditions.
For light microscopic investigations of the algae, Olympus BX51 and BX60 microscopes (equipped with
Nomarski DIC optics) were used. Microphotographs were taken with a ProgRes C14 plus camera using the
ProgRes Capture Pro imaging system (version 2.9.0.1, Jenoptik, Jena, Germany).
PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic methods. Single-cell PCR was used to obtain the sequences of the Coleps
strains. Before PCR amplification, single cells of Coleps were washed as described above. After starvation fol-

lowed by additional washing steps, cells were transferred into 5 μm sterile water in PCR tubes and the prepared
PCR mastermix containing the primers EAF3 and ITS055R71 was added. After this primary PCR amplification
and subsequent PCR purification, a nested PCR was conducted using the primer combinations EAF3/N1400R
and N920F/ITS055R71.
The sequences of the Coleps strains were aligned according to their secondary structures of the SSU and ITS
rDNA (see detailed folding protocol described in Darienko et al.52) and included into two data sets: (i) 34 SSU
rDNA sequences (1,750 bp) of representatives of all members of the Prostomatea and (ii) 19 ITS rDNA sequences
(538 bp) of the investigated strains. Genomic DNA of the green algae was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The SSU and ITS rDNA were amplified using the Taq PCR Mastermix
Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) with the primers EAF3 and ITS055R. The SSU and ITS rDNA sequences
of the isolated green algae (aligned according to the secondary structures) were included into a data set of 31
sequences (2,604 bp) of representatives of the Chlorellaceae (Trebouxiophyceae).
GenBank accession numbers of all newly deposited sequences can be found in Table S2 and in Fig. 7, respec-
tively. For the phylogenetic analyses, the datasets with unambiguously aligned base positions were used. To test
which evolutionary model fit best for both data sets, we calculated the log-likelihood values of 56 models using
Modeltest 3.772 and the best models according to the Akaike criterion by Modeltest were chosen for the analyses.
The settings of the best models are given in the figure legends. The following methods were used for the phylo-
genetic analyses: distance, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. Programs used
included PAUP version 4.0b16473, and MrBayes version 3.2.374.
The secondary structures were folded using the software mfold42, which uses the thermodynamic model
(minimal energy) for RNA folding.
Haplotype networks. The haplotypes of the V4 region were identified among the groups of Coleps (see Fig. S1).
The present haplotypes and the metadata (geographical origin and habitat) of each strain belonging to the dif-
ferent haplotypes are given in Table S3. To establish an overview on the distribution of the Coleps groups, the
V4 haplotypes were used for a BLASTn s earch62 (100% coverage, >97% identity). To construct the haplotype
networks, we used the TCS network tool64,65 implemented in PopART 75.
High‑throughput sequencing of the V9 18S rDNA region and subsequent bioinformatic analyses. On each sam-
pling date, water samples for a high-throughput sequencing approach (HTS) were taken in depths of 5 m and
40 m at Lake Mondsee and 5 m and 120 m depths in Lake Zurich. DNA extraction, amplification of the V9 SSU
rDNA, HTS and quality filtering of the obtained raw reads was conducted as described in Pitsch et al.10. After
quality filtering, all remaining reads were subjected to a two-level clustering strategy76. In the first level, repli-
cated reads were clustered in SWARM version 2.2.2 using d=177. In the second level, the representative sequences
of all SWARM OTUs were subjected to pairwise sequence alignments in VSEARCH version 2.11.078 to construct
sequence similarity networks at 97% sequence similarity. The network sequence clusters (NSCs) resulting from
the second level of clustering were then taxonomically assigned by running BLASTn analyses against NCBI’s
GenBank flat-file release version 230.0 and the Coleps SSU sequences obtained from single-cell sequencing. Net-
work sequence clusters were assigned to Coleps, if the closest BLAST hit of the NSC representative sequence was
a Coleps reference sequence. Furthermore, the NSC representative sequence had to share a fragment of at least
48 consecutive nucleotides and at least 90% sequence similarity to a reference sequence in order to be assigned
to Coleps.
Co‑occurrence networks. With the protist community data matrix resulting from HTS, we further conducted
co-occurrence network analyses to assess biotic and abiotic interactions of Coleps. For each lake and depth,
we ran network analyses with NetworkNullHPC (https ://githu b.com/lente ndu/Netwo rkNul lHPC) following the
null model strategy developed by Connor et al.79. This strategy was especially designed for dealing with HTS
datasets and allows for inferring statistically significant correlations between NSCs while minimizing false posi-
tive correlation signals. We screened the resulting networks for Coleps nodes and extracted their subnetworks
including all directly neighbouring co-occurrence partners as well as all edges between Coleps and its neighbours
and the neighbours themselves.
