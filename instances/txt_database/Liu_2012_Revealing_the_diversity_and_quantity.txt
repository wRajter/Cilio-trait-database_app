Peritrichs are a diverse, ecologically important ciliate group usually with a complex life cycle. To date, the community
of the peritrichs has been investigated by using morphology-based methods such as living observation and silver
staining. Here we show a molecular approach for characterizing the diversity and quantity of free-living peritrichs in
environmental samples. We newly designed four peritrich-specific primers targeting 18S rRNA genes that allow clone
library construction, screening and analysis. A quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was developed to quantify
peritrichs in environmental samples by using rDNA copy number as an indicator. DNA extracted from four water
samples of contrasting environmental gradients was analysed. The results showed that the peritrich community was
differentiated among these samples, and that the diversity decreased with the increase of water salinity. The qPCR
results are consistent with the library sequence analysis in terms of quantity variations from sample to sample. The
development of peritrich-specific primers, for the first time, for conventional PCR and qPCR assays, provides useful
molecular tools for revealing the diversity and quantity of peritrich ciliates in environmental samples. Also, our study
illustrates the potential of these molecular tools to ecological studies of other ciliate groups in diverse environments.

Peritrich ciliates are a large and highly diverse protistan small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene sequences

primers matched members of the subclass Mobilia and other
organisms, and that all the peritrich 18S rDNA sequences
available at present were targeted very well across lineages

were detected; the most frequently found (70%) sequences
belonged to the OTU2, which clustered with Epistylis

5) in the freshwater library were detected only once. Among
these, OTU1 clustered with OTU3 at 53% support. OTU4

For the two brackish sites, there were more OTUs (4 vs
1) in B2 than B1 (Table 2). OTU7 was represented by 7
clones in B1, clustering with Zoothamnium nii with 100%
bootstrap support. The B2 library was dominated by OTU8
and OTU9 (relative abundance 39% and 39%), which likely
belong to a population of Opisthonecta minima (EF417834,
sequence similarity about 99%) and the family Epistylididae,
respectively. OTU11 was similar to OTU9 and belonged to
Epistylididae. OTU10 was close to OTU1 and 3. Among
these OTUs, the taxonomic positions of OTU1, 3 and 10
could not be resolved in our phylogenetic analyses.
For the morphological observation of water samples, we
only found two morphospecies Epistylis sp. and Zoothamnium
