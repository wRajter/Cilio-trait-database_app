Abstract
Most ecological papers on planktonic protozoa lack reliable identifications and modem nomenclature. The present
review, which summarizes some recent progress in the taxonomy of planktonic freshwater ciliates, should encourage
ecologists and project leaders to pay more attention to species identification, for the benefit of ttre reliability of their
own results and of our general scienti{ic knowledge. The following genera and species are heated in some detril and

lntroduction
The concept of the "microbial loop" stimulated many scientists and hydrobiologists
to study ecological aspects of planktonic protozoa, mainly heterotrophic flagellates
and ciliates (Arndt and Nixdort, 1991; Fenchel, 1987). With few exceptions
(e.9. Finlay et al., 1988), the species involved were not or only very incompletely
and/or superficially identified, either, as I assume, because most people prefer to avoid
such a boring job or because they did not know that taxonomists have collected
valuable information on planktonic protozoa during the last 20 years. I thus welcomed
the invitation of the editor of this fascicule to compile some of the progress made in
the taxonomy of planktonic freshwater ciliates. Space limitation did not permit detail,
so I decided to treat such species as can be easily confused with others and those
described after the still indispensable monographs by Kahl (1930-35). In spite of this
and other shortcomings, I hope to encourage ecologists to pay more attention to
species identification, for the benefit of the reliability of their own results and of our
general scientific knowledge.

Benchmark Iiterature
Unfortunately, a comprehensive, updated key to the planktonic ciliates is not
available, and many species are still undescribed or insufficiently characterized. Thus,
a few books and some hundred reprints are necessary to have a well-ordered and
modern guide to the identification of planktonic ciliates. The following chronological
compilation focuses on benchmark publications; miscellaneous papers are mentioned
in the taxonomic section.
Taxonomic methods for studying ciliated protozoa were treated in detail by
Dragesco and Dragesco-Kern6is (1986), Foissner (1991) and Lee and Soldo (1992).
Bibliographic guides to the ecology of freeJiving protozoa were compiled by Finlay
and Ochsenbein-Gattlen (1982) and Fenchel ( I 987).
Faur6-Fremiet (1924): The first detailed study on planktonic ciliates. Still
indispensable for its detailed descriptions and excellent figures.

Taxonomy of Planktonic Ciliates l1
Gajewskaja (1933): A large, beautifully illustrated guide to the ciliates found in
Lake Baikal. Many new species are described; few of them are mentioned in the later
literature, although it is quite reasonable to assume that most occur also in other lakes.
Kahl (1930-35): These monographs, which include the results of Faurd-Fremiet
(1924) and Gajewskaja (1933), are still indispensable for their completeness and
detailed keys to species. "The Kahl" is, however, now rather outdated, i.e. species
number has at least doubled since his time. An updated treatise is in progress (see
below; Foissner, 1993 and Matthes et a1.,1988).
Sommer (1951): A comprehensive guide to peritrichs found in Lake Plön. Many new
species are described.
Bick (1972): An updated, though rather incomplete and not very attractively
illustrated guide to the planktonic ciliates. Also contains useful ecological data.
Corliss (1979): Still the only comprehensive text-book on morphology and
taxonomy of ciliated protozoa. Truly outstanding and indispensable. Suprafamilial
taxa are thoroughly characterized, all known genera are figured but not described.
Curds (1982) and Curds et al. (1983): A valuable generic key to the freshwater
ciliates. All genera are depicted by at least one line drawing and described in detail.
Literature to relevant species descriptions is indicated.
Maeda and Carey (1985) and Maeda (1986): An illustrated guide to the species of
oligotrichine ciliates. Species and their synonyms are depicted by line drawings and
described in fair detail; they are, however, not critically evaluated.
Small and Lynn (1985): This guide is widely used by ecologists. It contains a rather
biased introduction to recent ciliate systematics and depicts some common genera,
mostly only silver impregnated cells. It is, however, not a guide to species, as some
ecologists apparently assume. This may be due to the unfortunate inclusion of some
new genera and species which all are poorly described.
Dragesco and Dragesco-Kern6is (1986): An outstanding guide to the ciliates known
from tropical Africa. 267 taxa, including many planktonic species, are described in
detail and illustrated by 1136 beautiful line drawings. Short notes on ecology and
related literature are given to each species. Recently supplemented with species from
the coast of Lake Tanganyika (Dragesco and Dragesco-Kern6is, 1 99 1 ).
Matthes et al. (1988): An updated key to the suctorians and mobiline peritrichs. All
species, but not their synonyms, are figured by line drawings and briefly described. A
very helpful, though sometimes too simplistic, compilation.
Foissner et al. (1991, 1992, 1994; the last volume IV is in preparation): An
indispensable guide to 350 common ciliates found in running waters and in the
plankton of reservoirs and lakes. Each species is described monographically, i.e. the
taxonomic, faunistic, and autecologic literature is thoroughly reviewed and the
morphology is documented by many line drawings, light micrographs of living and
silvered specimens, and by scanning electron micrographs. Keys and descriptions are
designed to enable live identification. The four volumes comprise about 2000 pages
and 5000 figures.
Foissner (1993): An updated version of Kahl's monograph on colpodid ciliates,
some of which (e.9. Bursaridium) are widespread in lake plankton. 170 species are

I2 W. Foissner
recognized and illustrated by 2900 figures including many scanning electron
micrographs. Synonymy is discussed, nomenclatural problems are solved, detailed
morphological, ecological, and faunistic descriptions and reliable keys are provided.
Users can thus determine species without referring back to the original literature.
Ecologists and cell biologists will find detailed descriptions of all known colpodid
species and synonyms.
The species problem in "zoochlorellae" bearing ciliates
Rather many planktonic ciliates host green algae, mostly Chlorella (Christopher and
Patterson, 1983; Finlay et al., 1988; Reisser, 1986). It is widely assumed that such
green populations are conspecific with apochlorotic strains. Certainly, green
individuals often resemble apochlorotic congeners when superficially analyzed.
However, closer examination often reveals more or less distinct morphological
differences which are increasingly considered to be of significance at species level.
Several examples are mentioned below, e.g. Halteria grandinella and Pelagohalteria
viridis (differing even at genus level) as well as Coleps hirtus and C. spetai (differing
in the structure of the armour plates).
Well-documented cases of green populations matching apochlorotic congeners
exactly are not known to me. Christopher and Patterson (1983) report on a green and a
colourless Coleps hirtus. From the figures provided, it seems that the symbiotic algae
bearing, barrel-shaped population is C. spetai, whereas the colourless, cylindrical
population belongs to C. hirtus. Klaveness (1984) also found morphological
differences, though rather inconspicuous, between a green and an apochlorotic Coleps.
The integration of a symbiotic partner requires specific physiological and
behavioural mechanisms [see Reisser (1986) for review] which can be considered,
independently of morphological differences, as species characters. The zoochlorellae
in Paramecium bursaria. for instance, release distasteful metabolites which repel a
predator, Didinium nasutum (Berger, 1980). Certainly, the strength of association
between algae and ciliates varies, and in some cases it might be weak and not
associated with distinct morphological features. Generally, however, such differences
become obvious if the species involved are thoroughly studied. I thus recommend that
ecologists avoid lumping together green and colourless populations of a "species".
Notes for the identification of some planktonic ciliates
This section contains short descriptions of problematic or recently established
species. Usually, the description focuses on a few main points and thus cannot replace
the consultation of the references indicated. The material is arranged according to
major systematic categories familiar to many plankton ecologists. Within these groups
species are treated alphabetically.

Figs. 1-6. Planktonic, mesodiniid holotrichs from life (1-4, from Krainer and Foissner, 1990; 5, 6, from
Tamar, 1987, 1992). These species, which belong to the haptorid order Cyclotrichida, are usually
smaller than 50 Um and have a quick, jumping movement. Their ciliary pattem (t infraciliature) is
basically similar but differs in details; Mesodinium, e.g.,lacks the subequatorial kinety (ciliary) belt
(SKB). 1-4: Side view of Askenasia volvox (Fig. 1; length 40 Um), and extrusomes of A. acrostomia
(Fig. 2), A. chlorelligera (Fig. 3), and Rhabdoaskenasia minima (Fig. 4). These four species can be
distinguished by the shape of the extrusomes, the number of contractile vacuoles, the
presence/absence of symbiotic green algae, and details of the infraciliature. 5, 6: Mesodinium acarus
(Fig. 5; length 15-20 Um) and M. pulex (Fig. 6; length 20-30 pm) differ in size and "ciri" (PKB,

Holotrichs
Under this time-honoured but outdated heading a few forms which are common in lake
plankton and have been thoroughly redescribed during the last decade are discussed.

Figs. 7, 8. Scanning electron micrographs of planktonic, prostomate holotrichs (from Foissner er aL,

symbiotic algae, size of cell and caudal processes, shape, and structure of armour plates, which are
broadened wingJike in C. spetai (anows). For further comparison see Figures 9-13.
Actinobolina spp.: Three species have been described which differ in size, ciliary
pattern, and symbiotic algae: Actinobolina radians Stein, 1867 (50-125 gm, ciliary
rows distinctly spiralled); A. vorax Wenrich, 1929 (60-200 pm, ciliary rows almost
meridional); A. smalli Holt et al., 1973 (42-55 prm, ciliary rows slightly spiralled, with
symbiotic green algae).
Askenasia volvox (Eichwald, 1852): Easily confused with three other species recently
described by Krainer and Foissner (1990). Askenasia volvox: no symbiotic algae but
sometimes greenish by ingested algae, single contractile vacuole, extrusomes needle-
shaped, rostrum (anterior body portion) arched (Fig. 1); A. chlorelligera: with
symbiotic green algae, single contractile vacuole, extrusomes pin-shaped (Fig. 3),
rostrum truncated; A. acrostomrz: without symbiotic algae, four contractile vacuoles,
extrusomes rod-shaped with pointed ends (Fig. 2), rostrum tapered; Rhabdoaskenasia
minima: without symbiotic algae, single contractile vacuole, extrusomes conspicuously
club-shaped (Fig. a), rostrum truncated. Detailed morphological and ecological

Figs. 9-13. Light and scanning electron micrographs of planktonic, prostomate holotrichs (from
Foissner et al., 1994). Coleps hirtus (Figs. 10, 13; overview Fig. 7) and C. spetai (Figs. 9, 11, 12;
overview Fig. 8) differ not only in the absence/presence of symbiotic algae but also in the structure
of the armour plates, which are broadened wingJike in C. spetai (arrows).
Coleps hirtus (Mij'ller, 1786): Possibly often confused with the green C. spetai
Foissner, 1984b, which is more distinctly barrel-shaped and has symbiotic algae.
Furthermore, the armour plates of C. spetai have wing-like broadened marginal ridges
(cp. Figs. 8,9, 11, 12 with 7,10,l3). Other characters, like the shape of the armour
windows and the ciliary pattern are very similar in both species. Coleps spetai is
widespread in the plankton of eutrophic lakes and also not identical with C. hirtus var.
lacustris Faur6-Fremiet, 1924, which, like C. hirtus, lacks symbiotic algae and
"wings". There might be further, not yet described, Coleps species with symbiotic
algae. Detailed description of the morphology and ecology of common species in
Foissner et al. (1994).
Mesodinium pulex (Claparöde and Lachmann, 1859) and M. acarus Stein, 1863:
These tiny and fast-moving ciliates are not easy to study and details of their ciliary
pattern are still unknown. However, Tamar (1992, and literature cited therein)
undertook excellent living observations and suggested identifying these species by size

t6 W. Foissner
(usually 15-20 pm versus 20-30 pm) and "cirri", which form 2 and 3 circlets,
respectively, in M. acarus and M. pulex (Figs. 5, 6). Mesodinium fimbriaturn Stokes,
also redescribed by Tamar (1971), is possibly a junior synonym of M. acarus (Kahl,
l93O). Mesodinium rubrum (Lohmann, 1908), which causes spectacular red tides in
marine environments, has a different ciliary pattern and belongs to the genus
Myrionecta Jankowski, 1976 (Krainer and Foissner, 1990).
Obertrumia aurea (Ehrenberg, 1833): Easily confused with O. georgiana (Dragesco,
1972) and Nassula ornata Ehrenberg, 1833, which, however, have distinct trichocysts
(cp. Figs. 14, 19,21 with 15-18, 20). Obertrumia aurea (formerly in the genus Nasszla) is
possibly the sole nassulid common in lake plankton. It may develop heavy blooms under
eutrophic conditions and feeds on various filamentous cyanobacteria (e.g. Oscillatoria
rubescens) making the cells dark (Fig. 19). Detailed descriptions of the morphology and
ecology in Canter et al. (1990), Foissner et al. (1994), and Thomas (1941).
Pseudobalanion planctonicum Foissner et al. (1990): Easily confused with
Urotricha spp., which have a smaller oral opening and much shorter oral flaps
(cp. Figs. 22, 25). This small (about 20 x 15 pm) species is, as recent data indicate,
widespread in the lake plankton; very likely, it has often been misidentified as
Urotricha sp.
Urotricha spp.: Many species have been described; some are common in the
plankton of lakes. Unfortunately, a reliable identification is very difficult because no
newer revision is available. There is, however, one species which is easily recognized
by its two caudal cilia, viz. U. furcata Schewiakoff , 1892 (Fig. 22); detailed
descriptions in Foissner and O'Donoghue (1990) and Foissner et al. (1990). See
Dragesco et al. (1974), Foissner (1984a), Song Weibo and Wilbert (1989), and Wilbert
(1986) for descriptions and redescriptions of species having a single elongated cilium
or more than two caudal cilia (Figs. 23,24)
Hymeno stome s and s cutic oc iliate s
The common larger forms, llke Marituja, Stokesia and Disematostorna, have been
restudied with modern methods. The small, planktonic "scuticos" (e.9. Cyclidium,
Dexiotricha), which often become abundant under microaerobic conditions are still
poorly known.
Marituja pelagica Gajewskaja, 1928: This curious species, originally assumed to be
endemic to Lake Baikal, has since been found in several other lakes (Fig.26).Its size
and shape resemble Stokesia vernalis, Disematostoma tetraedricum, and D. buetschlii,
all of which, however, bear symbiotic green algae. Stokesia vernalis is easily
identifiable by its cap-like lateral appearance (Figs. 27,28). According to Krainer
(pers. comm.), Stokesia vernalis populations without symbiotic algae occur; possibly
they belong to another species. Disematostoma tetraedricum (Fig. 29) and
D. buetschlil (Fig. 30) differ in the shape of the anterior body portion. Detailed
descriptions of the morphology and ecology of these four species are found in Faur6-
Fremiet (1924), Foissner et al. (1994), Krainer (1994), Martin-Gonzalez et al. (1990),
Packroff and Wilbert (1991), Roque (1961), and Wilbert (1912).

makes well-fed cells dark at low magnification (Fig. 19). It is easily distinguished from
O. georgiana (Fig. 17) and Nassula ornata (ßigs.15, 16, 18, 20; length 250 Um) by its more slender

Peritrichs
Peritrichs occur in three forms in the plankton, viz. either truly stalkless
(e.g. Astylozoon) or stalked but free-swimming (e.g. Vorticella mayeri, Epistylis
rotans, Ophrydium spp.), or attached to other planktonic organisms, especially to
diatoms and colonies of bluegreen algae. The attached peritrichs (mostly vorticellids)
often occur in masses, but are poorly known. The morphology and ecology of the truly
stalkless and the euplanktonic taxa are extensively treated in Foissner (1915,1917,
1978) and Foissner et al. (1992). Attached species were revised, although very briefly,
by Warren (1986, 1987). I thus restrict discussion to a few forms which are possibly
often confused.
Astylozoon spp.: Species are differentiated according to cell and macronucleus shape
and the location of the contractile vacuole. Astylozoon fallax Engelmann, 1862 and
A. faurei Kahl, 1935, which have been recorded rather frequently from lake plankton,
have a kidney-shaped macronucleus and the contractile vacuole located at the ventral
or dorsal wall of the vestibulum (Figs. 31, 32). They thus differ clearly from Ä.
enriquesi Foissner, 1977, which also occurs in the lake plankton, and has a
semicircular macronucleus and the contractile vacuole at the dorsal vestibular wall
(Figs. 33-35).
Ophrydiumversatile (Müller, 1786): Easily confused with O. eutrophicum Foissner,
1979, which has a more elaborate oral apparatus, i.e. the peristomial ciliature winds
around the peristomial disc in about 2 rlz turns, as opposed to I rlz turns in
O. versatile. The anterior end of O. eutrophiczm is thus set off head-like from the
body, a feature which is easily recognizable ever, in vivo if cells are fully extended
(cp. Figs. 36, 40 with 37, 38, 4l). All other characters (size 250-600 pm, symbiotic
algae, large colonies etc.) match those known from O. versatile. Another species,
O. naumanni Pejler, 1962, is also stuffed with zoochlorellae and thus rather similar to
O. versatile; however, it is distinctly smaller (about 50 pm only) and does not form
large colonies. Further studies are necessary to prove whether O. naumanni is a
distinct species or a juvenile or hunger form of O. versatile. Detailed morphological
and ecological account ofcommon species in Foissner et al. (1992).
O li g otrichs ( C hore otric hs )
Oligotrichs are the dominant (in terms of number and biomass) and characteristic (in
terms of species) component of the planktonic ciliate community, both in freshwater
and marine environments. Foissner et al. (1991) thus referred to this community as
"Oligotrichetea", in analogy to the system used by phytosociologists.
The name "Choreotrichida", introduced by Small and Lynn (1985), designates an
artificial taxon (comprised of Tintinnina and Strobilidiina) and is thus superfluous; the
taxa in question can be well included in the time-honoured oligotrichs (Petz and
Foissner, 1992).

a kidney-shaped macronucleus and the contractile vacuole is at the ventral wall of the vestibulum.

vacuole is at the dorsal wall of the vestibulum. 33-35: Astylozoon enriquesi (length 60 gm) has, like
A. faurei, the contractile vacuole at the dorsal vestibular wall, but the macronucleus is semicircular.

the peristomial ciliature of O. eutophicum winds around the peristomial disc in about 2112 u^",
ll2
as opposed to 7 turns in O. versatile, giving the cells a cephalized appearance which is easily
recognizable even at low magnification (Fig. 38). Two and four ciliary windings (arrows) are
recognizable, respectively, because the ciliature consists of an adoral zone of membranelles which is
accompanied by an undulating membrane; these form a V-shaped pattern in feeding cells. The stalk

and differently arranged jumping bristles (cp. Figs. 42, 43 with 44,46). Note that
H. grandinel/a is sometimes also green-coloured, however, not by zoochlorellae but
by ingested algae. Another green species is H. bifurcata Tamar, 1968, whose jumping
bristles are curved and bifurcated and which moves more slowly than 1L grandinella
in a right-handed spiral. These characters are not easily recognized and one may hope
that silver impregnation will reveal further differences to both H. grandinella and

spp. by its more posteriorly located circumferential paratene (a ring containing short cilia and
trichocysts), by having a ventral row of short cilia, and by the simpler neoformation organelle.

algae and less pronounced cortical ridges. 50-52: Pelagostrombidiumfallax (Figs.50,5l; length
60 pm) and P. mirabile (Fig.52; length 45 Fm) are distinguished by the buccal adoral membranelles
which extend at least half cell length internally in P. fallax. Members of this genus have a
complicated neoformation organelle (Fig. 5l) from which the oral apparatus ofthe posterior
daughter cell originates during binary fission. BM = buccal adoral membranelles, CM = collar adoral

has meridional ciliary rows whose cilia are not fused to jumping bristles (Fig. 47).

Pelagostrombidium mirabile (Penard, 1916) and P. fallax (Zacharias,l895): Easily
confused with Strombidium spp., which have the circumferential paratene (the girdle
formed by the cilia and extrusomes) located in mid-body and a simpler oral anlage, i.e.
lack the potato-shaped embryonic body (Fig. 51). P. mirabile (Fig. 52): 45 x 30 pm,
slender conical to ovoid, greenish-grey to orange-yellow. Polysaccharide plates
usually square. 12-15 buccal membranelles extending a third of cell length internally;
P. fallax (Fig. 50): 60 x 50 pm, plump conical to almost globular, reddish-brown.
Polysaccharide plates polygonal. 19-22 btccal membranelles extending at least half
cell length internally. Detailed description of the morphology and ecology in Krainer

Rimostrombidium velox (Faur6-Fremiet, 1924): This green species, which is still
insufficiently known, is easily confused with R. lacustris Foissner et al., 1988
(Fig. a9), which, however, lacks zoochlorellae, but often appears greenish by ingested
algae, has less pronounced cortical ridges, and is larger (70-100 x 50-70 Um versus 30-
50 x 53 gm). Several other species of this genus occur rather frequently in the lake
plankton, e.g. the small (20-30 x 15 pm) R. humile. See Foissner et al. (1988, l99l)
and Krainer (1994) for a detailed account on the morphology and ecology of
R. lacustris and R. humile.
Strombidium pelagicum Krainer, 1991 [now S. pelagoviride becatse of
preoccupation; Krainer (1993)1. This species is considered by Foissner et al. (I99I) as
a junior synonym of S. viride Stein or of S. viride pelagica Kahl. The differences
indicated by Krainer are small and concern meristic characters (e.9. number of collar
membranelles) which the early authors, lacking the advantage of silver impregnation,
could not analyze in detail.
Strombidium viride Stein, 1867 (Fig. 48): Easily confused with Pelagostombidium
spp., which have the circumferential paratene (the girdle formed by the cilia and
extrusomes) located supraequatorially, i.e. at level with the buccal adoral membranelles.

Tintinnids (Figs. 53-55): See also Codonella cratera andTintinnidiumfluviatile.The
fresh-water tintinnids are well known, i.e. have been investigated with modern
methods. These studies showed that lorica characters are less important than the ciliary
pattern of the cell which, unfortunately, is clearly recognizable only after protargol
silver impregnation. The following fresh-water species were described or
reinvestigated and reliably characterized by Blatterer and Foissner (1990), Foissner
and O'Donoghue (1990), Foissner and Wilbert (1979), and Song Weibo and Wilbert

freshwater tintinnids need, however, protargol impregnation for reliable identification.

Maskell as T. fluviatile var. emarginata (i.e. T. fluviatile and T. semiciliatum are valid
species, whereas T. Jluviatile var. emarginala is a junior synonym of T. semiciliatum),
Tintinnopsis cylindrata Kofoid and Campbell, Codonella cratera (Leidy), and
Stenosemella lacustris Foissner and O'Donoghue. About 20 other tintinnids have been
described from, or reported to occur in freshwater. However, I am convinced that
most, if not all, are junior synonyms of the species mentioned above or
misidentifications. Typical examples are Tintinnopsis amphora, T. amphora
acuminata, and T. ovalis recorded by Pollingher and Kimor (1967) from Lake
Tiberias. These species are testate amoebae of the genus Dffiugial
Codonella cratera (Leidy, 1877): Several Codonella species and varieties have been
described from freshwater, based on differences in lorica structure and shape.
However, the investigations by Bernatzky et al. (1981) indicate that such differences
are caused by the habitat and the age of the lorica (Figs. 53, 54). I think that this genus
contains only one freshwater species, viz. the common C. cratera, originally described
by Leidy (1811) as testate amoeba. Detailed descriptions of the morphology,
morphogenesis, and ecology in Bernatzky et al. (1981), Foissner and Wilbert (1979),

Tintinnidium fluviatile (Stein, 1863), Tintinnidium pusillum Entz, 1909, and
T-intinnopsis cylindrata Kofoid and Campbell, 1929: These common planktonic fresh-
water tintinnids need protargol silver impregnation for reliable identification.
However, the lorica of T. fluviatile is usually larger (150 X 35-10 Fm) than in the other
species, and the lorica of T. cylindrata (40-150 x 20-30 ttm) is usually made of foreign
particles (sand grains, diatom frustules; Fig. 55), whereas it consists of a mucous
substance in the other species. Detailed morphological and ecological description as
well as key to Laurasian freshwater species in Foissner and Wilbert (1919), Foissner
et al. (1991), and Petz and Foissner (1993).
Heterotrichs
Heterotrichs are represented in the plankton mainly by the genus Stentor, which
often causes heavy blooms in small lakes used for recreation. The genus is in urgent
need of revision. Common species from Europe and Africa are treated in detail in
Dragesco and Dragesco-Kern6is (1986), Foissner et al. (1992), and Nilsson (1986).
Stentor niger (Mtjller, 1713): Easily confused with S. amethystinus Leidy, 1880,
which has violet granules and green symbiotic algae in the cortex, as opposed to
S. niger, which has rusty brown granules and lacks zoochlorellae. All other characters
are very similar in both species, especially their black appearance at low (< X 100)
magnification (Fig. 56).
Hypotichs
Few euplanktonic hypotrichs are known. Most remarkable are the genera
Pelagotrichidium and Hypotrichidium because of their beauty and complicated cirral
