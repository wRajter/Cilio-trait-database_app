ABSTRACT: The structure and ecological role of protozooplankton (ciliates and heterotrophic dinofla-
gellates) were studied in D~skoB ay, West Greenland, from mid-July to mid-September 1994. Hetero-
trophic dinoflagellates dominated the protozooplankton biomass. When diatoms formed subsurface
blooms, heterotrophic dinoflagellates averaged 70 % of the integrated protozooplankton biomass. After
the diatoms declined, large heterotrophic dinoflagellates became less abundant. Ciliates followed the
same vertical distribution as heterotrophic dinoflagellates. However, in contrast to heterotrophic
dinoflagellates, maximum ciliate biomasses developed in surface water after the diatom blooms, when
the large copepods (Calanuss pp.) migrated to the deeper water. Mixotrophic oligotrich ciliates, mainly
Laboea strobila, contributed on average 209" to the integrated ciliate biomass. Growth experiments
revealed similar specific maximu~ng rowth rates for ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Maxi-
mum growth rates were allometrically related to cell volume. Ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates
appear to be key organisms in the cycling of organlc matter in this Arctic pelagic ecosystem.

Species succession
Individual ciliate and heterotrophic dinoflagellate
species had different temporal distribution patterns
(Fig. 4). Some protozooplankton species had maximum
occurrence in the first part of the study with a decline
starting at the end of August and continuing during
September. This pattern was shown by Gymno-
diniumlGyrodiniurn spp. >50 pm (Fig. 41). Other spe-
cies had a biomass peak in mid-August. This was
clearly demonstrated by the potential mixotrophic cili-
ate Tontonia spp., but also by Protopendinium spp.,
Gymnodinium/Gyrodiniurn spp. 20-50 pm and Gyro-

60% in September (Fig. 5B). All size groups
were dominated by oligotrichs and
choreotrichs, but 'other' ciliates occasionally
contributed substantially to the biomass in
the ESD >40 pm size group. Heterotrophic
dinoflagellates, like ciliates, were numeri-
cally dominated by smaller cells (<30 pm).
They also increased in number towards the
end of the study, but in contrast to ciliates
small heterotrophic dinoflagellate cells
became significant in terms of biomass
(Fig. 5C,D). A major change in the relative
size distribution was observed following the
decline of the 2 subsurface diatom blooms in
August. Thus, the relative importance of
larger (>40 pm) heterotrophic dinoflagel-
lates in terms of biomass decreased from -80
to <30%.
The smallest ciliates recorded during this
study were Strornbidium-like cells with an
ESD of 8 pm (length X width = 12.5 X 10 pm).
The largest ciliates were Strornbidinopsis sp.
which had an ESD of 134 pm (length X width
= 165 X 120 pm).H eterotrophic dinoflagel-
lates also covered a wide cell size range, the
smallest and largest species both belonging
to the gymnodinoid type, with an ESD rang-
ing from 8 to 110 pm. Thus, the interspecific -1 0
variation in cell volume of protozooplankton
species from Disko Bay covers at least 4
orders of magnitude.
Intraspecific variation in cell volume was
correlated to temperature as illustrated by -30
