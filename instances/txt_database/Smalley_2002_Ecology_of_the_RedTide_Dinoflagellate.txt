ABSTRACT. Ceratium furca is a primarily photosynthetic dinoflagellate also capable of ingesting other protists. During 1995 and
1996, we documented the abundance of C. furca in Chesapeake Bay and determined grazing rates on prey labeled with fluorescent
microspheres. Abundance usually remained below 20 cells ml-', although the species was capable of localized late-summer blooms (5
478 cells ml-I) in the more saline lower to mid-Bay region. Feeding rates ranged from 0 to 0.1 1 prey dinoflagellate-' h-I or from 0 to
37 pg C dinoflagellate-' h-' and were highest at lower salinities. Clearance rates averaged 2.5 i 0.35 p1 dinoflagellate-' h-I. Impact
of C. furca feeding on prey populations was higher in the lower Bay, averaging 67% of Strobilidium spp. removed d-I. Ingestion rates
were positively correlated with prey abundance and dissolved inorganic nitrogen, but negatively with salinity, depth, dissolved inorganic
phosphorus, and inorganic P:N ratio. Daily consumption of prey biomass by C. furca averaged 4.6% of body carbon, 6.5% of body
nitrogen, and 4.0% of body phosphorus, with maximal values of 36, 51, and 32%, respectively. Thus, the ability to exploit an organic
nutrient source when inorganic nutrients are limiting may give C. furca a competitive advantage over purely photosynthetic species.

water samples for inorganic nutrient analysis (i.e. nitrate and
nitrite, ammonia, dissolved inorganic phosphate) were collected
at routine stations, filtered, and stored frozen until analysis
(Technicon Autoanalyzer 11, Bran and Luebbe detector, TAOS
software; Technicon Engineering Inc., Atlanta, GA), as de- h
scribed in Stoecker et al. (1997).
Feeding by C. furca on ciliate prey was determined at all
-
stations and depths where C. furca densities exceeded 0.25
cells ml-'. Ingestion rates were determined as described in
Smalley, Coats, and Adam (1999). Briefly, whole water con-
taining C. furca was spiked with 1-km fluorescent latex micro-
spheres (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) at a final concen-
tration of 0.5-1.0 X lo7m l-I. The water was incubated in poly-
carbonate bottles (250-ml to 2-liter bottles, depending on C.
furca density) in a flowing seawater bath on deck. The water-
bath was covered with a screen that reduced the incoming light
intensity by approximately 65%. Twenty- to 40-ml aliquots
were withdrawn and immediately preserved in modified
Bouin's fixative (Coats and Heinbokel 1982) for subsequent
determination of ciliate abundance. After approximately six
hours of incubation, 100 ml to 2 liters of the sample were fixed
in modified Bouin's solution for analysis of C. furca density
and ingestion rates.
Ceratium furca densities and number of food vacuoles per
C. furca cell were determined by placing each sample in a Zeiss
settling chamber (5 to 50 ml, depending on C. furca densities).
After allowing sufficient time for settling, the entire chamber
was scanned at 200X to 400X on an inverted microscope
equipped with epifluorescence optics (Zeiss Axioscope; 450-
490 nm excitation). Cell densities were obtained by determining
the total number of cells per chamber. The number of labeled
food vacuoles per cell was recorded for the first 100 specimens
encountered. Hourly ingestion rate was then calculated by di-
viding the mean number of food vacuoles per C. furca by in-
cubation time. This approach was justified as Smalley, Coats,
and Adam (1999) found a linear increase in food vacuoles per
cell over at least six hours, indicating that food vacuoles were
retained during this time period. To enumerate and identify cil-
iates, 20- or 40-ml quantitative Protargol stain (QPS) prepara-
tions were made (Montagnes and Lynn 1987) from each sample
where C. furca feeding had been determined. Ciliates present
in arbitrarily selected microscope fields (1,00OX, Zeiss Axio-
scope) were enumerated and identified to genus until 100 cells
had been encountered or an equivalent of 4 ml whole-water
sample analyzed. Specimens belonging to the genus Strobili-
dium were measured using a calibrated ocular micrometer, and

Alternatively, factors other than or in addition to salinity and
temperature may influence C. furca distribution. In our study,
C. furca abundance was positively correlated with salinity dur-
ing cruises in 1996. Furthermore, the species was not found
below the 10 psu isohaline, suggesting that salinity limited the
northward expansion of C. furca during the summer of 1996.
In 1995, however, no significant correlation between C. furca
distribution and salinity was evident. In addition, the northern
limit of the C. furca population coincided with waters ranging
in salinity from 13 to 18 psu. Thus, the peak C. furca abundance
-
at 15 psu reported in this study probably reflects an interplay
of salinity tolerance and other factors, such as inorganic and
organic nutrient supply or grazing pressure.
A profound effect of river flow on the dynamics of phyto-
plankton biomass and production has been demonstrated for
Chesapeake Bay at both seasonal and annual scales (Fisher et
al. 1992, 1999; Harding 1994; Malone et al. 1988, 1996). Riv-
erine input is the major source of freshwater and external ni-
trogen to the Bay. During winter and spring, maximum fresh-
water flow provides high nitrogen concentrations, pushing the
system towards P limitation. When freshwater runoff decreases
in summer, N becomes limiting to algal growth. Nutrient lim-
itation also varies over spatial scales due to freshwater inflow
with high N:P and seawater inflow with low N:P (Fisher et al.
1999). Consequently, P limitation is more pronounced in low
salinity regions, while N limitation increases at higher salinities.
During our study period, mean annual flow of the Susque-
hanna River, the major source of freshwater to the Bay, was
much lower in the drought year of 1995 (68 X lo6 m3 d-') than
in 1996 (156 X lo6 m3 d-I; data from US Geological Survey,
Conowingo, MD). Consequently, salinity at our sampling sites
was reduced significantly during cruises in 1996 compared to

32% body C, N, or P, respectively. These values are similar to
or higher than values reported for other primarily photosyn-

ingested an average of 2.5% of its body C d-I (maximal value
12%) and 4.0% of its body N d-I (maximal value 19%; Bock-
stahler and Coats 1993b). Daily ingestion of cryptophyte bio-
mass by Gyro. galatheanum was lower, averaging only 0.5%
of its body C, 0.6% of its body N, and 0.9% of its body P, with
maximal values of 13%, 13%, and 21%, respectively (Li,
Stoecker, and Coats 2001).
The potential contribution of prey C, N, and P to C. furca
nutrition depends on the conversion factors used to convert prey
vol. to biomass. As C. furca primarily feeds on small ciliates
of the genus Strobilidium (Smalley, Coats, and Adam 1999),
we determined C, N, and P densities for a small Strobilidium
sp. and used these values in our calculations. Carbon to vol.
