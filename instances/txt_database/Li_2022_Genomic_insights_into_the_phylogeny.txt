Abstract
24
25 Understanding the biodiversity and genetics of the gut microbiome has important
26 implications for host physiology. One underexplored and elusive group is ciliated protozoa,
27 which play crucial roles in regulating gut microbial interactions. Integrating single-cell
28 sequencing and an assembly-and-identification pipeline, we acquired 52 high-quality ciliate
29 genomes of 22 rumen morphospecies for all major abundant clades. With these genomes, we
30 firstly resolved the taxonomic and phylogenetic framework that reclassified them into 19
31 species spanning 13 genera and reassigned the genus Dasytricha from Isotrichidae to a new
32 family Dasytrichidae. Via extensive horizontal gene transfer and gene family expansion,
33 rumen ciliates possess a broad array of enzymes to synergistically degrade plant and
34 microbial carbohydrates. In particular, ~80% of the degrading enzymes in Diplodiniinae and
35 Ophryoscolecinae act on plant cell wall, and the high activities of their cellulase,
36 xylanase and lysozyme reflect the potential of ciliate enzymes for biomass-
37 conversion. Additionally, the new ciliate dataset greatly facilitated the rumen metagenomic
38 analyses by allowing ~12% of reads to be classified.

Introduction
40
41 The genomes of hundreds of thousands of gut prokaryotes have been sequenced, which have
42 greatly advanced our understanding of their taxonomic and functional diversity and important
43 roles in host health and nutrition1–3. Trichostome ciliates (of the phylum Ciliophora, class
44 Litostomatea) are ubiquitous in the gut microbiome of vertebrates4,5, and they serve crucial
45 roles in modulating the gut microbiome through predation, competition, and symbiosis6.
46 However, genomic research on gut ciliates has lagged1, and by far only Entodinium
47 caudatum, one of the most common species in the rumen of ruminants, has been subjected to
48 genomic study7. The lack of genomic information on the ciliate has become an obstacle for
49 holistic studies of the gut microbiome, rumen microbiome in particular, as ciliates can
50 account for up to 50% of the total rumen microbial biomass and approximately 200
51 morphospecies have been described in the rumen6.
52 Despite their prominence in the rumen ecosystem and extensive previous research over
53 one century8, much remains to be learned about rumen ciliates9,10. Based on morphological
54 features, rumen ciliates are primarily classified into two clades: family Isotrichidae in the
55 order Vestibuliferida (with cilia covering the entire cell surface) and family Ophryoscolecidae
56 in the order Entodiniomorphida (with localized zones of cilia including one or two adoral
57 cilia zone)4,6. It has been recognized, however, taxonomic identification and classification of
58 ciliates based on morphological features are challenging6,11, as the same species can exhibit a
59 few different morphotypes12. The 18S rRNA gene of ciliates has been used to aid species
60 identification13, but it has several limitations in proposing a new taxonomic framework,
61 including topological discrepancies even at the subfamily level5,14 and too conserved to
62 uncover cryptic species15.
63 It has also been challenging to determine or investigate the actual metabolism of rumen
64 ciliates because of the lack of and inability to establish axenic cultures. As a result, our

65 knowledge of rumen ciliate metabolism can only be inferred from studies using monocultures
66 (that contain bacteria and other microbes) or defaunation (complete removal of rumen
67 protozoa chemically or through physical isolation), both of which introduce confounding
68 effects of other microbes and residual effects10,16. Recent genomic and transcriptomic studies
69 provided new insights into the metabolism and physiology of several species of rumen
70 ciliates7,17. However, the functional diversification and evolutionary mechanisms underlying
71 most rumen ciliates linkages remain undetermined. Additionally, the unique genome
72 structures (e.g., nuclear dimorphism, chromosomal fragmentation) make ciliates valuable
73 model organisms to understand many important fundamental molecular and cellular
74 processes and features, such as catalytic RNA, telomerase, and histone acetylation18,19.
75 However, most knowledge comes from a few free-living aerobic ciliate species within the
76 classes Oligohymenophorea and Spirotrichea20,21, while rumen ciliates, which are anaerobic
77 and symbiotic, are exclusively found in the class Litostomatea.
78 In this study we de novo assembled and analyzed 52 high-quality single-ciliate-cell
79 amplified genomes (SAGs) from 22 rumen morphospecies, which were reclassified into 19
80 species spanning 13 genera and three families in the newly genome-based taxonomy. One
81 assembly-and-identification pipeline was developed to help improve the quality and accuracy
82 of genome assembly of ciliates. This unparalleled genome catalog of rumen ciliates greatly
83 facilitated and/or enabled better understanding and determination of their taxonomy,
84 phylogeny, metabolism, and ecology.
Results
85
86 Recovering single-ciliate-cell amplified genomes
87 We sequenced the DNA amplified from 69 individual single ciliate cells isolated from fresh
88 rumen fluid sampled from 15 cattle and goats (Supplementary Table 1). They represented
89 22 ciliate morphospecies (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1-3) belonging to 11 prevalent and

90 abundant morphogenera, which represent ~97% of the genus-level abundance across our
91 collected samples and published studies (Supplementary Table 2). We also sequenced the
92 amplified transcriptome22 of 24 of the isolated single-ciliate-cells and 14 rumen
93 metatranscriptomes for de novo gene prediction (Supplementary Fig. 4).
94 Because rumen ciliate cells carry other microbes as endosymbionts or engulfed microbes
95 (primarily bacteria) and because the DNA of the latter can also be amplified and sequenced,
96 we developed an assembly-and-identification pipeline to recover and identify ciliate
97 macronuclear sequences (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Briefly, using contigs
98 assembled from the 2.5 Tb sequences from the single cells and the ~17 Tb publicly available
99 rumen metagenome (Supplementary Table 3), we constructed an 18 Gb assembled dataset
100 of contigs of rumen ciliate macronuclear, all of which were capped on both or one end with
101 telomeric repeats ((CCCCAAT)n). This dataset was searched for the contigs that did not have
102 any telomeres in the single-ciliate assembled contigs (see Methods). Additionally, we
103 performed hybrid assembly and deep sequencing to improve the assembly quality
104 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Of the 69 SAGs we assembled (Supplementary Table 4), 52 had
105 ≥80% of the 171 Alveolata conserved marker genes23 and were considered “high-quality”,
106 while 17 had <80% of the Alveolata conserved marker genes. The 52 high-quality SAGs
107 were used for further analysis. Among the 52 SAGs, the telomere-capped contigs ranged
108 from 14% to 92% (mean 61%) of the total contigs (Supplementary Table 4). One of the
109 SAGs of Oph. caudatus (referred to as SAGT3) had the highest number (26,497 to be exact)
110 of complete chromosomes (contigs capped with telomere at both ends), plus another 33,578
111 contigs that were capped with telomere at only one end. The chromosome number of Oph.
112 caudatus is at least 43,286, which is much more than the known large number of
113 chromosomes in ciliates, Oxytricha trifallax (16,000) and Halteria grandinella (23,000)20,24.
114 Deriving a robust genome-based taxonomy and phylogeny

115 A robust taxonomy is an organizing principle of biology to communicate scientific results
116 and describe biodiversity25,26. Using the 52 SAGs, we established a robust genome-based
117 taxonomic framework of rumen ciliates that overcomes the uncertainty inherent of the
118 morphology-based taxonomy.
119 Whole-genome average nucleotide identity (ANI) has emerged as a widely accepted
120 method for circumscribing prokaryotic species, with 95% ANI as a species boundary26,27. We
121 found a clear ANI discontinuity among the SAGs: >97% or <92% (Fig. 2a-b) and considered
122 ANI >97% and <92% for intra-species and inter-species cutoffs, respectively. Based on the
123 above ANI cutoff values, we found four pairs of synonymic species in Ophryoscolecidae
124 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6). This is exemplified by Oph. caudatus, Oph. purkynjei
125 and Oph. bicinctus (Fig. 1v-x and Supplementary Fig. 3) being classified as a single species,
126 although Oph. caudatus was isolated from sheep and goats with a long main caudal spine and
127 three circles of secondary caudal spines, whereas Oph. purkynjei and Oph. bicinctus were
128 isolated from cattle with a short main caudal spine and two circles of secondary caudal
129 spines, respectively6. Similarly, Dip. anisacanthum and Dip. dentaum, Dip. flabellum
130 aspinatum and Dip. flabellum monospinatum, Ost.gracile and Ost. venustum were synonymy,
131 respectively (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). These suggest that the shape of the main
132 caudal spine, the number of secondary caudal spines, and habitat host are not reliably
133 taxonomic worth for Ophryoscolecidae. On the other hand, despite having morphological
134 similarity, two new cryptic species of Isotrichidae were identified (ANI < 92%, Fig. 2a):
135 tentatively named as Iso. sp. YL-2021a and Iso. sp. YL-2021a. The former was a cryptic
136 species (Fig. 1b) of Iso. prostoma and it had a longer body (278 µm) than Iso. prostoma,
137 while the latter was a cryptic species (Fig. 1d) of Iso. intestinalis and it had a lower ratio of
138 body length to width (1.3 on average) but longer chromosomes (22.5 kb on average) than Iso.
139 intestinalis. Additionally, the 18S sequence identity between synonymic morphospecies was

140 all >99% while that among the four Isotrichidae species was all <98% (Supplementary Fig.
141 6), which also supports the taxonomic revision at the species level. Accordingly, the 22
142 collected morphospecies were reclassified to 19 species.
143 The current taxonomic ranks for rumen ciliates at or above the genus level also lack
144 molecular evidence. For example, the 18S rRNA gene phylogeny placed the subfamilies
145 Entodiniinae and Ophryoscolecinae as two branching lineages within the subfamily
146 Diplodiniinae5,14. To resolve the phylogenetic challenges, we firstly constructed a maximum
147 likelihood (ML) tree using 113 concatenated single-copy proteins with Tetrahymena
148 thermophila as an outgroup (Fig. 2d). We also constructed a species tree using OrthoFinder28
149 under the coalescent model (Supplementary Fig. 7). The two trees were consistent in
150 topology and had 100% bootstrap support for each node. The results support Entodiniinae
151 representing the oldest branch in Ophryoscolecidae and Ophryoscolecinae as a sister to
152 Diplodiniinae, which is consistent with their morphological inference29. The concatenated
153 protein-based phylogeny served as the basis for the taxonomic rank normalization at and
154 above genus using relative evolutionary divergence (RED)25. Comparing the RED value with
155 the RED intervals of taxonomic ranks (median RED ± 0.1), the genus Dasytricha was
156 reassigned from Isotrichidae to a new family Dasytrichidae, which was treated as a synonymy
157 of Isotrichidae in the past4. Additionally, Ent. bursa and Ent. caudatum were reassigned to a
158 new genus Entodinium_A, and Iso. prostoma and Iso. sp. YL-2021a were reassigned to a new
159 genus Isotricha_A (Fig. 2c-d). For consistency with the family Ophryoscolecidae,
160 subfamilies Isotrichinae and Dasytrichinae were created for the families Isotrichidae and
161 Dasytrichidae, respectively. Ultimately, the 19 identified ciliate species were assigned to two
162 orders, three families, five subfamilies, and 13 genera (Fig. 2d). The genome-based
163 taxonomy supports the taxonomic worth of the size and number of skeletal plates, which is a
164 newly evolved organelle for storing amylopectin in the clades of Ophryoscolecinae and

165 Diplodiniinae6 and useful in differentiating genera. However, the phylogenetic relationships
166 among the genera within Diplodiniinae did not reflect the number of skeletal plates, as
167 evidenced by Diplodinium without skeletal plate but being more closely related to
168 Enoploplastron with three skeletal plates than Eremoplastron with only one skeletal plate.
169 This suggests a single origin of the skeletal plates, which was probably lost in Diplodinium.
170 Invasion into the rumen was one of the most important events in the evolutionary history
171 of Trichostome ciliates5. As shown above, not only rumen Ophryoscolecidae, as previously
172 suggested5, but also Isotrichidae have radiated in speciation. Molecular clock analyses
173 showed that explosive radiation of both Ophryoscolecidae and Isotrichidae occurred about 5 -
174 35 million years ago (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 8), which is consistent with the
175 duration of the rapid radiation of ruminants30, suggesting concurrent co-evolution and co-
176 speciation between ruminants and rumen ciliates.
177 Genome architecture and gene family diversity
178 Explosive speciation can result from a series of genomic changes and innovations, and the
179 genome catalog of the rumen ciliates provides new insights into their early diversification.
180 The genomic architecture features of Isotrichidae were obviously divergent from those of
181 Dasytrichidae and Ophryoscolecidae (Supplementary Table 4), despite Dasytrichidae and
182 Isotrichidae being in the same order. Notably, Isotrichidae had a lower GC content and longer
183 gene-coding regions and gene introns than Dasytrichidae and Ophryoscolecidae
184 (Supplementary Fig. 9-10). Most interestingly, the two classic chromosome architectures of
185 ciliates macronuclear genomes31 existed in a single subclass (Fig. 3a): the genomes of
186 Ophryoscolecidae and Dasytrichidae were extensively fragmented (EF) with gene-sized
187 nanochromosomes having a mean length of 2.3 kb, while the genomes of Isotrichidae were
188 non-extensively fragmented (NEF) minichromosomes with a mean length of 14.3 kb, mostly
189 encoding several genes each. The genomes of its sister-subclasses Haptoria and sister-classes

190 Spirotrichea were both EF32, therefore, we inferred that the genome of the common ancestor
191 of rumen ciliates was EF, and the NEF genomes of Isotrichidae was an independent origin
192 according to the parsimony principle of evolution33. However, similar to EF genomes, the
193 chromosome copy numbers in the NEF genomes of Isotrichidae were nonuniform
194 (Supplementary Fig. 11), while those in the NEF genomes of the classes Heterotrichea and
195 Oligohymenpphores were approximately equal32.
196 Using OrthoFinder28, we annotated 64,189 gene families from the 52 SAGs (Fig. 3e and
197 Supplementary Fig. 10), of which, 40,898 were shared by at least two species, and 23,291
198 were identified as species-specific (ranging from 110 in Ost. mammosum to 3,818 in Oph.
199 caudatus). Of the species-shared families, only 14,871 (36.4%) were found in both
200 Vestibuliferida and Entodiniomorphida, while the remaining gene families were
201 Vestibuliferida-specific (6,091) or Entodiniomorphida-specific (19,936). Of the
202 Entodiniomorphida-specific families, 10,043 arose at the clades of Diplodiniinae and
203 Ophryoscolecinae. This suggests that extensive lineage-specific gene families arose in the
204 early and during the diversification of rumen ciliates into modern orders. Additionally,
205 compared with the common ancestor of rumen ciliates, more subfamily-shared gene families
206 expanded in Entodiniomorphida (2,784/7,031) than in Vestibuliferida (53/7,031) (Fig. 3e). As
207 a result, species in Entodiniomorphida, in particular in the clade of Diplodiniinae and
208 Ophryoscolecinae, had larger and more diverse gene families than the species in
209 Vestibuliferida (Fig. 3d), which might have further induced the functional divergence across
210 orders and subfamilies (Fig. 3c). Comparing the differential investment in KEGG pathways
211 and Gene Ontology terms across those clades (Supplementary Fig. 12-13), we found that the
212 members of the Isotrichidae possessed a higher proportion of genes related to organismal
213 systems and environmental adaptation (e.g., endocrine, immune, detoxification, and
214 antioxidant activity), while those of Ophryoscolecidae were primarily related to biomass

215 (e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, and xenobiotics) degradation and metabolism. Indeed, compared
216 the domains of order-specific genes between Isotrichidae and Ophryoscolecidae, Isotrichidae
217 had a relative higher predominance of HSP70 and WD40, which are related to stress
218 resistance34 and biogenesis of motile cilia35, respectively, while Ophryoscolecidae had a
219 higher relative predominance of CAZymes-related domains (GT, GH, CBM and cellulase)
220 (Fig. 3e).
221 Rumen ciliates possess a broad array of CAZymes
222 The gut microbes are of huge industrial interest due to their ability to release fermentable
223 sugars from lignocellulose36–38. Here, we found that the rumen ciliates were also a rich source
224 of biomass-degrading enzymes. A total of 33,693 non-redundant (< 99% identity) CAZymes
225 were predicted in the 52 SAGs (Fig. 4a), and only 357 had a highly similar match (≥95%
226 identity) in any of the public protein databases (nr, env_nr, m5nr, UniProt TrEMBL) and the
227 rumen bacterial and fungal protein datasets1,2,39,40, indicating that 99% of the CAZymes can
228 be considered new. In particular, the species of Diplodiniinae and Ophryoscolecinae encoded
229 as many CAZyme as gut fungi, the latter of which possesses the largest number of CAZyme
230 genes yet known in nature37. And the species of Diplodiniinae and Ophryoscolecinae encoded
231 more CAZyme genes than Entodiniinae (by two-fold) and Isotrichidae and Dasytrichidae (by
232 five-fold) (Fig. 4b) with clear profile-divergences (Fig. 4c), largely attributed to the extensive
233 gene family arising and expansion.
234 Predicting the substrates of glycoside hydrolases (GH) and polysaccharide lyases (PL) by
235 categorizing their corresponding EC number (EC 3.2.1.- or EC 4.2.2.-), we found that each
236 species of the rumen ciliates possessed a broad array of enzymes to synergistically degrade
237 plant cell wall (cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin), plant non-structural carbohydrates
238 (fructan and starch) and microbial carbohydrates (chitin and peptidoglycan) (Fig. 4d).
239 Moreover, SAGs encoded multiple enzymes to synergistically degrade a single kind of

240 polysaccharides and the resulting oligosaccharides. For example, the Ophryoscolecid SAGs
241 possessed endo-β-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), endo-1,6-β-
242 glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.75), and β-1,4-cellobiosidase (EC 3.2.1.91), allowing them to degrade
243 cellulose. Less than one-quarter of the degradative CAZymes (ranging from 6% in
244 Ophryoscolecinae to 24% in Isotrichinae) of ciliates were invested in degrading microbial
245 carbohydrates, suggesting that their energy acquisition through microbe predation is limited.
246 Most of the degradative CAZymes of Diplodiniinae (72%) and Ophryoscolecinae (82%) were
247 invested in degrading plant cell wall, while those of Isotrichinae (45%), Dasytrichinae (44%),
248 and Entodiniinae (44%) were mainly invested in degrading plant non-structural carbohydrates
249 (Fig. 4e). These observations revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the variable
250 substrate preferences across subfamilies6 and why ciliates could reach up to half of the rumen
251 microbial biomass6. The variable investment tradeoffs in degradative CAZymes partly avoid
252 an overlapping niche across subfamilies, and thus enabling a robust performance of the
253 overall biomass degradation process41. Additionally, rumen ciliates ingest substrates into
254 digestive vacuoles (Supplementary Fig. 14) to which they deliver their degradative
255 enzymes, which can help increase the binding efficiency between degrading enzymes and
256 substrates due to close proximity and improve the utilization efficiency of the degradation
257 products. Taken together, the broad array of CAZymes, variable substrate preferences, and
258 intra-vacuoles digestion in rumen ciliates may contribute to their energy acquisition and use
259 from recalcitrant plant materials and allow for their ecological success in the rumen
260 ecosystem.
261 Compared with rumen ciliates, non-gut Alveolate species (n =13) possess a much smaller
262 number and lower diversity of degradative CAZymes, and they are incapable of digesting
263 xylan-related hemicellulose (xylan, xyloglucan, and arabinoxylan) or pectin (Fig. 4d),
264 suggesting that most degradative CAZymes of rumen ciliates were not likely obtained by

265 vertical inheritance. To determine whether this innovation is the result of inter-kingdom
266 horizontal gene transfer (HGT), we extracted and built phylogenetic trees of homologous
267 sequences from the genomes of rumen bacteria, gut fungi, non-gut Alveolate, and rumen
268 ciliates. The results showed that the CAZymes of rumen ciliates mainly originated via HGT
269 from gut bacteria and fungi (as high amino acid sequence similarity and phylogenetic
270 nesting), and most of them had more than one HGT event, which could occur in the early or
271 during the diversification of rumen ciliates (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 15). For
272 example, xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) has recruited five gene families (GH5, GH10, GH11, GH30
273 and GH43) from bacterial and fungal donors, involving at least 15 HGT events (9 from
274 Firmicutes, 4 from Bacteroidota, 1 from Fibrobacteria, and 1 from fungi).
275 Structural divergences of horizontally transferred CAZymes were always observed
276 between ciliates and the corresponding donors, such as the loss of the CBM22 domain in EC
277 3.2.1.8 in GH43, the acquisition one motif in EC 3.2.1.91 in GH5, the loss of motif in EC
278 3.2.1.4 in GH5 and EC 3.2.1.8 in GH10, and truncation at terminal non-domain regions of the
279 above four enzymes (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 16). To investigate the enzyme
280 activities differences between horizontally transferred CAZymes, we cloned and
281 overexpressed one cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4 in GH5) and one xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8 in GH10)
282 from both bacteria and ciliates using Pichia pastoris. The results showed that the ciliate
283 cellulase and xylanase had nine-fold and two-fold higher activity than those of bacterial
284 donors, respectively (Fig. 4h).
285 Additionally, 25.6% of the degradative CAZymes could not be annotated to any EC
286 numbers. We evaluated the substrates and activity of one GH19 protein of Oph. caudatus also
287 after cloning and overexpression in P. pastoris, and the results showed that it was a lysozyme
288 (with a specific activity of 36,007 U/mg), and the purified GH19 protein inhibited
289 Micrococcus luteus (Gram-positive), but not Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) (Fig. 4i). The

290 characteristic selective inhibition of the Gram-positive bacterium suggests that this ciliate
291 lysozyme was a potential alternative to monensin, which is one of the most successful rumen
292 modifiers in improving ruminant feed efficiency but has been banned in some countries
293 because it is an ionophore and appears residues in milk and meat42.
294 Enabling metagenomic analyses of rumen ciliates
295 The sequenced genomes can greatly facilitate metagenomic analyses of microbiomes
296 including communities of rumen ciliates. We re-analyzed 902 publicly available rumen
297 metagenomes (Supplementary Table 3) against three datasets: 1) the RefSeq genomes and
298 rumen microbial genomes2,43, 2) dataset 1) plus the SAGs of the rumen ciliates, and 3) dataset
299 2) plus the metagenome-assembled ciliate sequences. The results showed that the read
300 classification rates of metagenome as rumen ciliates could be affected by the host, diet, and
301 management (Fig 5a, c). Of note, the classification rates as rumen ciliates decreased by 99%
302 in the metagenomes of sheep that suffered from subacute ruminal acidosis due to feeding of a
303 high concentrate diet44, which is consistent with previous experimental findings that ciliates
304 are sensitive to pH45. Of the 902 metagenomes, 726 were from animals fed a diet with a
305 concentrate content of <80%, which is considered a low risk for subacute ruminal acidosis
306 according to the dramatic drop of ciliate abundance. And in the 726 rumen metagenomes, our
307 ciliate dataset allowed for classification of 12% of the total reads on average, with a large
308 range from 0.1% to 72% (Fig 5a). With the improvement of ciliate dataset, the total read
309 classification rates across metagenomes increased and became more convergent than
310 otherwise. For example, with the improvement of ciliate dataset, the total read classification
311 rates in the 285 samples of Stewart et al.2,38 increased from 39-92% to 72-94%, and one-fold
312 more of the samples (33% vs. 73%) achieved a classification rate of 80% or higher (Fig 5b).
313 Of the identified ciliate reads in the metagenomes, more than 73% could be classified based
314 on SAGs, suggesting that the collected ciliates comprised a considerable fraction of the

315 rumen ciliates community (Fig 5d). Interestingly, based on microscopic counting,
316 Entodiniinae as the most dominant rumen ciliates can account for >90% of the total rumen
317 ciliates in domesticated ruminants (Supplementary Table 2), but only ~25% of the identified
318 ciliate sequence reads were assigned to Entodiniinae. This discrepancy might be attributable
319 to (1) the lack of the genomes of some abundant Entodiniinae species, such as Ent. dilobum
320 and Ent. rostratum, and (2) the ploidy of Entodiniinae was likely lower than that of other
321 rumen ciliates.
Discussion
322
323 Compared with gut bacteria and archaea1–3, eukaryotic microbes (protozoa and fungi) are
324 understudies and represent an underexplored genetic resource46. Here, we used single-cell
325 sequencing to circumvent the lack of the inability to establish axenic cultures of rumen
326 ciliates and developed a ciliate-telomere-capped sequence dataset to aid the identification of
327 ciliate sequences from mixed sequences. Compared with previous studies on fungi and
328 flagellate47,48, the more successfully captured ciliate genomes from individual cells were
329 largely attributed to their mini-/nano-chromosomes, which typically have a high ploidy20,24.
330 Metagenomic binning is the other technique to recover uncultured microbial genomes36, but it
331 is not applicable to recover ciliate genomes due to their large number and nonuniform copy
332 numbers of chromosomes and the dependence of binning on sequencing depth. In this study,
333 the unparalleled genome catalog of rumen ciliates shines new lights on their taxonomy,
334 evolution, and metabolism, and also greatly facilitates the rumen metagenomic analyses by
335 allowing ~12% of reads to be classified.
336 How to define the boundaries for individual taxonomic rank for microorganisms
337 including ciliates is challenging25,26 because the reproductive isolation principles were not or
338 mostly not applicable and pure cultures are not available for most microorganisms.
339 Combining two quantitative operational methods: ANI and RED, we revised the taxonomy

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.05.474053; this version posted January 5, 2022. The copyright holder for this preprint

340 for rumen ciliates, which allowed 45% of the 22 collected morphospecies to be changed to
341 their existing taxonomy. Using this revised taxonomy, nine synonymic Ophryoscolecidae
342 morphospecies, two cryptic Isotrichidae species and two new genera were identified, and
343 genus Dasytricha was reassigned from Isotrichidae to a new family Dasytrichidae. The
344 genome-based taxonomy corroborated or rejected the taxonomic worth of some
345 morphological features of rumen ciliates, which will help to revise the morphology-based
346 taxonomy and to identify new species.
347 Additionally, we provided a phylogenetic backbone to understand the evolutionary
348 processes of specific traits and early diversification in rumen ciliates, such as the origin of the
349 non-extensively fragmented minichromosomes in Isotrichidae, the origin and loss of skeletal
350 plates in Ophryoscolecidae. The identified novel traits will facilitate future research on
351 ciliates in general. For example, compared with the previous inter-class investigations49,50, the
352 rumen ciliates will provide a more allied model for investigating the unsolved molecular
353 mechanisms underlying chromosome fragmentation21.
354 Importantly, we showed that rumen ciliates were another important weapon for
355 ruminants to degrade nearly all kinds of plant-derived polysaccharides. In particular, the
356 species of Diplodiniinae and Ophryoscolecinae encoded as many CAZyme genes as gut
357 fungi, and ~80% of their degrading enzymes acted on plant cell wall. Most of the ciliate
358 degradative CAZymes were obtained via HGT from bacteria and fungi7,17, but they
359 underwent considerable sequence divergence from the donor. The experimentally identified
360 promising activity of their cellulase, xylanase and lysozyme reflects the potential application
361 of ciliate CAZymes in biomass conversion and microbiota modulation.
Methods
362
363 Single-ciliate-cell isolation, identification and sequencing
364 All the experimental procedures on animals were conducted per the guidelines of the

365 Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals (Ministry of
366 Science and Technology, China, 2013) and were approved by the Northwest A&F University
367 Animal Care and Use Committee.
368 Individual ciliate cells were isolated from fresh rumen fluid samples collected from 15
369 ruminally fistulated ruminants (6 Holstein cattle, 3 Qinchuan beef steers, and 6 Guanzhong
370 dairy goats) all kept in Yangling, Shannxi Province, China using glass micropipettes under an
371 inverted microscope (Nikon, TI-FL, Japan). We purposely selected ciliates with distinct
372 morphologies. The single ciliate cells were repeatedly transferred and washed using MB9
373 buffer51 until no other ciliate cells could be found microscopically. The washed single ciliate
374 cells were then transferred to individual microtubes each containing 2 µl of cell lysis buffer. A
375 total of 69 single ciliate cells representing 22 morphospecies (as identified morphologically,
376 detailed below) were isolated, and 45 of them were subjected to whole-genome amplification
377 (WGA) using multiple displacement amplification52 and the remaining 24 single ciliate cells
378 were subjected to parallel WGA and whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA) using the
379 G&T-seq22,53 (Supplementary Table 1). Illumina TruSeq libraries were prepared for each of
380 the amplified genomes and transcriptomes and then sequenced (2 ×150 bp) on an Illumina
381 NovaSeq platform.
382 The morphological identification of rumen ciliates54 was conducted with light
383 microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The
384 morphological description and micrographs of the isolated ciliate species are summarized in
385 Supplementary Fig. 1-3. The taxonomic identification of the collected single ciliates was
386 confirmed by sequencing analysis of their 18S rRNA genes after the genome assembly. The
387 ciliates in the rumen samples were counted using a Sedgewick-Rafter chamber as described
388 previously54.
389 Genome assembly and ciliate sequence identification

390 The cleaned Illumina reads of each WGA sequencing were assembled using both MEGAHIT
391 (v1.2.1)55 and SPAdes (v3.13.1)56. The contigs assembled by the two assemblers were merged
392 into longer contigs using quickmerge (v1.2.1)57.
393 The sequence characteristics of rumen ciliates were identified as follows. Firstly, the
394 ends (30 bp) of WGA contigs were used to identify telomeric repeats using MEME
395 (v4.12.0)58, and the telomeric repeats of the collected morphospecies were all identified as
396 (5’-CCCCAAT)n. Secondly, complete chromosomes (contigs that were capped with at least
397 1.5 telomeric repeats without mismatch at both ends) were extracted from the WGA contigs
398 using a python script32. Contigs with potential contamination sequences (each with a >20%
399 GC content for the subtelomeric region (100 bp immediately adjacent to the telomere) and a
400 GC content >44% GC for the rest of the contig) were filtered out with an error rate of 1%
401 allowed.
402 The publicly available rumen metagenomes (n=902, Supplementary Table 3) were
403 downloaded from the NCBI SRA, and were assembled using MEGAHIT. These contigs were
404 also subjected to decontamination as mentioned above. The decontaminated contigs from the
405 SAGs and the metagenome-assembled contigs were combined into an 18 Gb sequence dataset
406 of rumen ciliate macronuclear sequences, which were capped with telomeric repeats at one or
407 both ends (Supplementary Fig. 4). The 18 Gb of contigs of ciliates plus other rumen
408 microbial genomes2,36,38–40,43,59,60 were used as a reference to pick the ciliate sequences that
409 do not have any telomeres in the WGA assembled sequences using blastn (v2.6.0+). The
410 sequences with the best match to ciliate sequences (>85% identity over >500 bp and >50%
411 coverage of reference or query) were considered as ciliate sequences.
412 The telomereless contigs picked above and the telomere-capped contigs with >3X of read
413 depth were retained in SAGs. Genome completeness of each SAG was assessed using
414 BUSCO v561 with OrthoDB v1023 using the predicted protein-coding genes as input. Of the

415 69 SAGs (Supplementary Table 4), 52 had ≥80% of the 171 Alveolata conserved marker
416 genes and were considered “high-quality”, while 17 had <80% of the Alveolata conserved
417 marker genes.
418 Gene prediction
419 The ciliates in rumen fluid samples (n=14) were enriched by filtering (150 µm) and
420 centrifugation (500 ×g for 5 min). The eukaryotic mRNAs in the ciliate-enriched samples
421 were extracted and purified as previously described61, and used for metatranscriptome
422 sequencing. The single-cell transcriptomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing reads were
423 mapped to SAGs using Hisat2, and assigned to each species.
424 Protein-coding genes were de novo annotated using AUGUSTUS (v3.2.3)62. Firstly, the
425 WTA sequence reads were assembled using Trinity (v2.8.4)63. The assembled transcripts were
426 used to train the de novo gene prediction model62. The best model was that of Pol.
427 multivesiculatum with 93.5% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity at the exon level. Gene
428 predictions of SAGs were performed also using AUGUSTUS and the best model with
429 mapped RNA-seq data as ‘‘hints’’. The tRNAs-coding and rRNA genes were identified using
430 tRNAscan-SE (v2.0.5) and Barrnap (v0.9), respectively.
431 Circumscribing species
432 The ANI and alignment coverage between genomes were calculated using pyani (v0.2.10)64
433 with the default parameters. A clear gap existed between 92% and 97% in ANI values, and
434 thus ANI >97% was considered synonym, and ANI <92% was inter-species circumscription.
435 Phylogenomic tree construction and higher taxonomic rank normalization
436 A total of 113 single-copy homologous genes were identified among the 19 representative
437 genomes and Tet. thermophila genomes (as outgroup) by OrthoFinder (v2.5.2)28. These
438 single-copy genes were aligned and concatenated into supergenes for ML-based phylogenetic
439 using RAxML (v.8.2.9)65. A species tree was also constructed using OrthoFinder based on the

440 52 SAGs.
441 The concatenated protein-based phylogeny of the 19 rumen ciliates species served as the
442 basis for high taxonomic rank (at and above genus) normalization using the RED values
443 calculated with PhyloRank (v0.1.0)25. The RED intervals for normalizing taxonomic ranks
444 were defined as the median RED value for taxa at each rank ±0.1. Comparing the RED values
445 with the RED intervals of taxonomic ranks, the taxa that fell outside of their RED distribution
446 was corrected.
447 Divergence time estimation and gene family expansion
448 Divergence times of these species were estimated based on the ML tree via Bayesian relaxed
449 molecular clock approach using MCMCtree program in the PAML package (v.4.9)66. The
450 calibrated points of the common ancestor of rumen ciliate species (<135 Mya) and
451 ophryoscolecid species (<55 Mya) were obtained from Vďačný et al.5.
452 Orthologs gene families among the 52 SAGs were identified using the OrthoFinder. To
453 reduce the limitation of single-cell genomes, the maximum gene number in each gene family
454 among different SAGs of each species was used in the CAFE (v5.0)67 to infer the expansion
455 and contraction of gene families.
456 Functional annotation
457 Functional annotation (KEGG, GO and COG) of the predicted proteins was performed using
458 eggNOG mapper (v2.0.1) with the DIAMOND mapping mode, based on the eggNOG 5.0
459 orthology data68. The protein domain was annotated using pfam_scan.pl compared to
460 Pfam_A. CAZymes annotation was executed using dbCAN269 against the CAZyme database
461 V9. The CAZymes were categorized with their corresponding EC number by aligning against
462 uniprot_sprot and CAZyme database V9 using Diamond (v0.9.21.122) with an E-value cutoff
463 of e-3.
464 Identification of CAZymes with HGT signature

465 To compare the CAZyme numbers and profiles of rumen ciliates with rumen bacteria (n =
466 2,405), gut fungi (n=8), non-gut Alveolate (n =13) (Supplementary Table 5), the CAZymes
467 of the latter microbes were also annotated as above. The 2,405 rumen bacterial genomes
468 served as the representative genome at species-level (ANI>95%) for the 4,941 metagenome-
469 assembled genomes from Stewart et al.2 and 410 genomes from the Hungate 1000 project1.
470 For each CAZyme (the same family with the same EC number), a phylogenetic tree
471 among rumen ciliates and other microbes was constructed using IQ-TREE (v2.1.4-beta)70
472 with 100 bootstrap replicates. The potential HGT events were inferred using the pipeline and
473 cut-offs of Haitjema et al.39.
474 Catalytic activity assay of cellulase and xylanase
475 In vitro enzymatic activity assays were used to test the the cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4 in GH5) from
476 rumen ciliate (Oph. caudatus) and its HGT donor (Treponema bryantii NK4A124), and
477 xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8 in GH10) from rumen ciliate (Ost. gracile) and its HGT donor
478 (Ruminococcus flavefaciens YRD2003). Four genes were codon-optimized according to P.
479 pastoris preference. Construction of recombinant plasmids and heterologous expression and
480 purification followed the procedures previously described71. The cellulase and xylanase
481 activities were measured as previously described72,73. Each experiment was performed with
482 three reaction replicates to determine the mean ± s.d. of the catalytic activity value of the
483 enzymes.
484 Catalytic activity assay of lysozyme
485 The substrates and activity of one GH19 (it includes lysozyme and chitinase) protein of Oph.
486 caudatus were examined after cloning into P. pastoris. The enzymatic substrate assay showed
487 that it was a lysozyme, which activity were measured as previously described74. The
488 antibacterial ability of this lysozyme was tested by inhibition of Micrococcus luteus (ATCC
489 4698) and Escherichia coli (CVCC 3367), as a representative of Gram-negative and -positive

490 bacteria, respectively, zone assay on agarose plates.
491 Sequencing reads classification
492 The sequencing reads of 902 publicly available rumen metagenomes were classified using
493 Kraken (v2.0.7-beta)75 against three custom databases: 1) Public database, consisting of all
494 microbial genomes from RefSeq (release 201) plus rumen microbial genomes; 2)
495 Public+SAGs database, 3) Public+Ciliates database, consisting of public database, all 52
496 SAGs, and the ciliate-telomere-capped sequences from the 902 metagenomes.
497 Data availability
498 All sequencing data and assembled genomes have been deposited in the NCBI database with
