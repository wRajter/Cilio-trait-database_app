ABSTRACT: The present study investigated the possibility of a trophic link between ciliates and
nematodes in fine sandy sediments of the Molenplaat intertidal flat (Schelde estuary, SW Nether-
lands). Grazing experiments were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions, with ciliate spe-
cies isolated from enrichment cultures and nematodes collected directly from the field. Significant
reductions in ciliate numbers were found in the presence of the predatory nematode Enoploides
longispiculosus, a prominent species (and genus) in fine to medium sandy sediments of the North Sea
and adjacent estuaries. No such effects were found when ciliates were inoculated with a mix of
mainly deposit-feeding nematodes from the same sampling site. On the basis of these results, ciliate
predation by E. longispiculosus was tested for several benthic ciliate species and abundances, at a
range of predator abundances and temperatures, and in the presence of alternative prey (in casu
nematodes). E. longispiculosussignificantly reduced the densities of 5 out of 6 ciliate species offered
as prey. Depending on the experimental conditions and the prey species, predation rates ranged from
0.19 to 10.8 ciliates predator–1 h–1, corresponding to a biomass consumption of 0.001 to 0.33 µg C
predator–1d–1. An overall positive relation between available ciliate biomass and predation rate was
found. Comparison of experimental data with field conditions suggests that a considerable part of the
ciliate production in fine sandy sediments of the Molenplaat is likely to be consumed by E.
longispiculosus, which largely dominates meiofaunal biomass there. Estimated carbon requirements
for the predator and production estimates of ciliate and nematode prey at the study site strongly sug-
gest that ciliates are probably a far more important carbon source for E. longispiculosusthan nema-
tode prey, at least between late spring and autumn. This implies that carbon transfer from primary
producers and bacteria to predatory nematodes may to a large extent be mediated through the micro-
bial food web. In view of the generally high densities and biomasses of ciliates as well as predacious
nematodes in fine sandy sediments, similar patterns are to be expected in many other estuarine and
marine sediments.
