Thisis anupdateof thereviewby Foissner (1991).Since then, Ihaveimproved some methods
considerably. The following methods are describedindetail: liveobservation, supravitalstaining
withmethyl green-pyronin, dry silvernitrate impregnation, wet silvernitrate impregnation, silver
carbonate impregnation, protargol impregnation (threeprocedures), scanning electron
microscopy,anddeciliation.Familiaritywiththesemethods(ormodifications)isaprerequisitefor
successful taxonomic work. Nostaining method is equallyappropriate toall kindsofciliates. A
tableisprovidedwhichindicatesthoseprocedureswhichworkbestforcertaingroupsofciliates.
A second tablerelates tothe structures revealed by theprocedures. Gooddescriptions usually
demandatleast liveobservation, silvernitrate andprotargol or silvercarbonate impregnation.
Some instructions areprovided fordistinguishing mono-anddikinetids aswellas ciliatedand
non-ciliated basal bodiesinsilveredciliates. Furthermore, Iadded a section on ‘Depositionand
Labeling ofPreparations’. All methodswork not only withciliates butalso withmanyother
heterotrophic andautotrophic flagellated andamoeboid protists. The brilliancy ofsilver
preparationshastemptedsometaxonomiststoneglectliveobservation.However,manyimportant
speciescharacteristicscannotbeseenorarechangedinsilveredspecimens.Ithusconsiderall
species descriptions based exclusively on silverslidesas incomplete andofdoubtful valuefor
