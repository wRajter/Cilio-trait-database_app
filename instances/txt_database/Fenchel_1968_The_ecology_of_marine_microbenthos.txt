ABSTRACT

Growth rates ofpopulations of9 benthic marineciliate species were measured in purecultures 71:10
at differenttemperatures. All specieshad a maximalgrowth rateabove20°Cwhich isabovethe
average temperature in their natural environment. Several species multiplied at 4°C and one
ta
species also at O°C, and it is suggested that all species are able to multiply at temperatures be- ]lehcneF
tween0 and4°C at very slow rates afterlongperiodsofadaptation.
At 20°Cgeneration times varied between2.4 hours (Uronema marina) and 46 hours (Condy-
lostomapatulum) correspondingto intrinsic rates ofnatural increase (r, per day): 6.65-0.36 and
moT
finite rates ofincrease(A" perday): ca. 1000-1.4.
The maximal reproductive rate ofciliates was found to be correlated with cell size. It was
found thatT = kXVO.44,whereT isgeneration timeandvisthe average bodyvolume. rM[
The reproductiverates ofciliates are compared with values ofr for small metazoans (based

INTRODUCTION
negahnepoC[
Knowledge on the reproductive potentials is of importance when the role played
by different organisms in natural environments is to be evaluated. The purpose
ofthe presentpaperis to report on the reproductive rates of some benthicciliates
and to compare them with the reproductive rates ofother animal groups.
It is well known that when an animal population is allowed to increase un- yb
checked, the increase ofthe population is at any moment proportional to the size dedaolnwoD
ofthe population at that particular moment, thus:
dNjdt = rN
or in an integrated form:
(1)

124 TOM FENCHEL
where No and N, are the population sizes at time 0 and t respectively, e is the
base of natural logarithms and r is a constant known as the "intrinsic rate of
natural increase". IfT is the generation time and R, is the net reproductive rate
per generation (viz. N, +TINt) (1) gives

r=~-- (2)

For protozoa and other animals which multiply by division into two daughter 2102
individuals T is the period oftime between two successive divisions and R o = 2,

thus:

r=~T-= - T- (3)
The "finite rate of increase" it is defined as it = e"and is, as may be seen from 22
(1), a measure of how many times a population will multiply per unit of time. 71:10
Several authors (Andrewartha & Birch, 1954; Macfadyen, 1963; Slobodkin,
1962; Smith, 1954) have stressed the great value ofr in ecological work since it is ta
a true measure ofthe reproductive potential which allows comparisons between ]lehcneF
very different kinds of animals. The fact that this measure has been used to a
small extent only in practical ecological work is due to difficulties in determining
r in the great majority ofmetazoan species which have overlapping generations moT
and deposit their eggs over a longer period of time, and r has only been deter-
rM[
mined with accuracy in few cases (see above-mentioned literature and the discus-
sion in the present paper for references and methods for determination of r in ,]yrarbiL
metazoan populations).
For any animal population r may assume several values, one for each set of
environmental factors (availability and nature offood, salinity, temperature, pH, ytisrevinU
etc., etc.,). Ifr = 0 thepopulation sizeisconstantand ifr is negativeit isdecreas-
ing. Under optimal conditions r will assume a value characteristic for the species
in question. This value will be a measure ofthe reproductive potential ofthe spe-
negahnepoC[
cies. In practice absolute optimal conditions will probably never be observed in
the field nor will they be reproduced in the laboratory, but close approximations
are often easily obtained.
The value or r is ofinterest becausethis as mentionedabove, makesit possible
to compare reproductive rates ofdifferent kinds ofanimals and also because ex- yb
ponential growth of populations of small animal species is not uncommon in dedaolnwoD
nature. Bick (1964) demonstrated exponential growth in protozoan successions
under laboratory conditions. I have observed exponential growth phases ofciliate
populations in succession experimentsas wellas in thefield (unpublished observa-
tions). Similar blooms ofplanktonic organisms are well known.
The generation time (T) or the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) of some
protozoan species frequently used in physiological and biochemical work have
often been determined (see for example Phelps (1946) and Prescott (1957) for the

REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF CILIATES 125
ciliate Tetrahymena (since the rate of the logarithmic growth of these organisms
is used as a measure of the effect ofvariousfactors (temperature, nutrition, drugs,
etc.) but few ofthese works have an ecological scope and no comparisons have
been made between the values ofr for a larger number ofspecies.
Bick (1964) determined r from the growth ofa number ofciliate species and
the coelenterate Hydra in mixed cultures and demonstrated the importance of r
for the understanding ofthe course ofmicrofaunal successions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
ta
Nine species were used in the present study. Uronema marina Dujardin, 1841, ]lehcneF
Aspidisca angulata Bock, 1952,and Litonotus lamella (Ehrenberg, 1838)were iso-
lated from sand samples from the Helsingor Beach; Euplotes vannus (0.F.M.,
1786), Diophrys scutum Dujardin, 1841, Lacrymaria marina Dragesco, 1963 and moT
Condylostomapatulum Claparede & Lachmann, 1858were isolatedfrom sediment
rM[
samples from the Niva Bay; Keronopsis rubra (Ehrenberg, 1838) was isolated
from the trays in the sea-water system ofthe laboratory and an undescribed phi- ,]yrarbiL
lasterid was isolated from a culture of lamellibranch larvae (see Fenchel, 1968).
Animals which were used for initiating cultures were taken from cultures in
their logarithmic phase with the exception of Condylostoma and Lacrymaria be- ytisrevinU
causethe reproductive rate ofthesespecies always decreased somewhataftersome
generations in pure culture, probably due to some deficiency of micro-nutrients
in the food offered. These species were taken directly from mixed cultures.
negahnepoC[
All cultureswereinitiatedwith 2to 12individuals. Thesmall species (Uronema
and the philasterid)were cultured in a drop ofculturefluid betweentwocoverglas-
ses sealed with vaseline, the other species were kept in Boveri dishes. Aged sea-
water (19%0 S) with the food item added was used as culture fluid.
After the culture fluid and ciliates had been added to the culture vessels these yb
were incubated at the desired temperature. At intervals ofsome hours or once a dedaolnwoD
day - according to the expected reproductive rate ofthe species examined - the
culture vessels were placed under the dissection microscope and the number of
ciliates counted. An experiment was terminated when the logarithmic growth
phase hadendedor when the numberofanimalswas too large for directcounting.
In the lattercasethe animalswerecountedalast time byremovingthemone byone
with a pipette or after killing and staining them with methyl green in acetic acid.
Due to the method ofdirect countings the accuracy is considered to be absolute'

Freshly made solutions gave rise to a comparatively long lag phase in the growth
ofthe populations.
The optimal concentrations ofotherfood items was notinvestigated,butsince
these items were considered harmless to the ciliates, even in very high concentra-
tions, they were added in so large amounts thatthe reproductiverateofthe ciliates yb
could not be affected by lack offood. In most cases the experiments were reason- dedaolnwoD
ably reproducible even though two series ofcultures of Uronema gave somewhat
diverging results (Fig. 4).
Figs. 2 and 3 show the development of cultures of Uronema and Litonotus
respectively at various temperatures.
T was estimated from growth curves describing the logarithmic phase and r
was calculated from (3).
The volumes ofciliates were measured as described in Fenchel (1967).

In all experiments - with the exception of those on Uronema, Litonotus and
Diophrys at temperatures above lODe - a lag phasewas apparentin the beginning ytisrevinU
ofthe experiments. The lag phase was longest at low temperatures (Figs. 2, 3).
A lag phase seems sometimes inevitable in protozoan cultures (see Hall, 1967)
and the reason for this is not always clear. I my experiments the long lag phase
negahnepoC[
at low temperatures is probably to some extent due to a period of temperature
adaptation (stock cultures were kept at room temperature). The lag phase of the
two species which were taken from mixed cultures may also be due to a period of
adaptation, in this case to a new diet.

RESULTS
In Fig. 4 the reproductive rates of the investigated species (as r and as T) are
plottedagainst temperature. As pointed out by Phelps (1946)QI0 may beexpected
to vary with temperature. The number ofdifferent temperatures used during the
present study is therefore too small to give a detailed picture ofthe effect of tem-
perature on the reproductive rate.

130 TOM FENCHEL
For Tetrahymena Phelps found three distinct values ofQI0 with sharp breaks
betweenthem:QI0 was 9.7at7.8-12.3°C,2.9at l2.3-20.0°Cand 1.5at20.0-28.6°C.
Highest growth rate was found at 29°C, and at about 32°C no growth occurs.
Neither did growth occur below 5_6°C.
The results ofthe present investigation indicate a constant QI0 in the interval
from 4-8°C to 20°C for Uronema and Aspidisca which weretestedatseveraltem-
peratures. At lower temperatures QlO increases in accordance with the findings of
Phelps. The values ofQlO ofthe various species in the interval 8-20°C varied be- 2102
tween 3.5 (Uronema) and 2.3 (Litonotus).
Only one species, Diophrysscutum, was cultured at temperatures above 23°C. rebmeceD
The highest growth rate was found at 27°C while nearly no growth occurred at
31-32°C.
Uronema grew both at 4°C and at0°C. Aspidiscagrew at 4°C, and it was not
22
incubated at lower temperatures. Litonotusmultiplied at 5°C but not atO°C dur- 71:10
ing 10 days of incubation. Diophrys did not grow at 4°C and O°C. All species
survived for at least 2-3 weeks at 0°C and behaved normally even though no ta
multiplication took place. ]lehcneF
James & Read (1957) demonstrated thatthe cell sizeofTetrahymena increased
in incubations at low temperatures. This effect was observed in several ofthe spe-
cies studied; it was especially evident in Uronema. moT
On Fig. 5the reproductive rate at 20°C,as expressed by r, A,and T, isplotted
rM[
against the volume ofthe animals. A correlation between cell size and reproduc-
tive rate is evident. Calculation of the regression line gives the equation r (per ,]yrarbiL
day) = 105.9XV-O.44orT(hours) = 0.0065XVO.44when the volumevisgivenin fL3.
At 15° the calculation gave a somewhat different exponent (0.42) since QlO is not
quite identical in the different species. ytisrevinU
The largest and the smallest species studied (Condylostoma and Uronema
respectively) almost represent the extremes in size ofciliates, and their reproduc-
tive rates are therefore considered as nearly showing the limits in variation of
negahnepoC[
reproductive rates in these animals.
At 20°C, r for Uronema has the value 6.65 per day, i.e. a generation time of
2.5 hours. At the same temperature Condylostoma has a generation time ofabout
46 hours corresponding to a value ofr = 0.36perday. Theenormousdifferencein
reproductive potential between these two species is made clear when Ais consi- yb
dered. A population of Condylostoma will under optimal conditions at 20°C in- dedaolnwoD
creasebyafactor 1.4in24hours. Duringthe same periodapopulationof Uronema
will increase by a factor of 1000.

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have shown that several freshwater ciliates have an optimum
temperature in the region 25-32°C (Phelps, 1946; Prescott, 1957, a.o.). During
the presentinvestigation this was also shownto be the case with Diophrysscutum,
and all species studied - with the possible exception ofLacrymaria - have their
temperature optimum above 20°e. Thus the optimum temperature is far above
the average temperature of the sea. In temperate regions temperatures of25-30°C
2102
can only be reached in very shallow water on hot summer days. However, the re-
lations between temperature and reproductive rates ofthe well studied species in-
rebmeceD
dicate a better adaptation to low temperatures than found for the Tetrahymena
studied by Phelps (1946), which would not divide below 5-6°C. The present
findings indicate that reproduction will occur nearly troughout the year exept in
22
very shallow water during periods ofextreme cold.
71:10
Studies on field populations of sand ciliates indicated multiplication even at
o +
to 1°C (Fenchel, 1967,and unpublished observations).It is possible that the
ta
other species studied may divide at even lower temperatures than 4°C like Uro-
]lehcneF
nema which divided at O°e. Efimoff(1924) found that Paramecium has a genera-
tion time of 13days at O°e. Ifa long lag perioddue tocoldadaptationexists, my
experiments have been too short to show these very slow rates.
moT
It is obvious that the standing crop will not be a measure of the biological
activity when comparisons at different temperatures are made. The population rM[
sizesneed not decrease much with decreassing temperatures since the smallerrate
,]yrarbiL
ofreproduction will be counteracted by a smaller rate ofpredation. Some morta-
lity factors will of course remain constant and a small decrease in population size
of ciliates may therefore be expected in winter though not at all comparable to
ytisrevinU
the decrease in the reproductive rate which will be 10 to 20 times lower at 4°C
than at 20°e. A small decrease in size ofciliate populations was actually found
in field populations (Fenchel, 1967). In contrast, several groups of micro-meta-
zoans do not reproduce at all in winter (Muus, 1967; Theisen, 1966) and field negahnepoC[
populations of species belonging to these groups show much more pronounced
summer peaks and winter minima.
It is well known that when the total animal kingdom is considered the repro-
ductive potential tends to decrease with increasing body size (see Smith, 1954).
yb
A clear correlation between body size and reproductive potential within an
dedaolnwoD
animalgrouphas not, however, been demonstrated before. This correlationallows
one to estimate the generation time of a ciliate species when its body volume is
known and the great variation in reproductive potential within the ciliates may
be explained by the greatvariationin sizeofthis group (more than three decades).
The reason why the exponent in the equation r = k X volume-o•44 just takes
the value -0.44 is not understood. Before a theoretical discussion can be fruitful
more data should be provided, also from other groups, and the intrinsic rates of

natural increase should be compared at the optimum temperature rather than at
an arbitrarily chosen temperature.
Fig. 6 allows one to compare the reproductive potential (r and Ie), generation
time and the net reproductive rate per generation (R a) for all types of organisms
from virus to man.

134 TOM FENCHEL
Measurements of r of bacteria are numerous. The data on Escherichia coli
represents populations grown on peptone broth and glucose respectively and
show the order ofmagnitude ofr for bacteria.
The data on ciliates derive from the present study (20°C values, thus some-
what below optimumrate in contrast to other data on the figure) except those on
Paramecium caudatum and Tetrahymenapyriformis which fit into the present data
accordingto theirsizes(Datafrom Andrewartha & Birch, 1954andPhelps, 1946).
Since several groups of protozoa - especially within the flagellates - contain 2102
species which are much smaller than the smallest ciliates it is probable that the
range ofthe reproductive rates ofprotozoa in general should be extended some- rebmeceD
what in the direction of higher rates as indicated on Fig. 6.
Due to the difficulties in calculating the reproductive potential of metazoans
not multiplying by division there are still very few data with which the present 22
findings may be compared. Most ecologists have given egg numbers, develop- 71:10
ment time and/or estimates ofgeneration time as measures ofreproductive rates,
but these data are very difficult or impossible to evaluate. As may be seen from ta
(2) and Fig. 6 and as pointed out by Smith (1954) and Slobodkin (1962) the effect ]lehcneF
ofincreasing R, (viz. the offspringperfemale per generation) is surprisingly small
compared with the effect ofdecreasingT. Thus, for example, the tape worm does
not have an especially high reproductive rate as is commonly believed, in spite of moT
the enormous numbers ofeggs produced (Fig. 6).
rM[
Andrewartha & Birch (1954) give methods available for calculating r in me-
tazoan populations. This requires a life-table ofthe animalpopulationin question ,]yrarbiL
and a table of age-specific fecundity. If Ix is the chance ofsurvival at age x and
mxisthe fecundity at age xthen R o= ~Ixmx. Forapproximatecalculation, T may
be estimated and r calculated from (2). The real value of T may be difficult to ytisrevinU
evaluate and methods have been developedfor evaluating r independent ofT and
the exact value ofT is then calculated from rand R o.
In the present investigation it is of interest to compare the reproductive po-
negahnepoC[
tential ofciliates with that of micro-metazoans living in soft sediments.
Stiven (1962) gives r = 0.34 per day for Hydra growing under optimal condi-
tions, and Cole (1960) found r to be 0.12 for the largeflatworm Dugesia. K.Muus
(1966) found a generation time for the small coelenterate Protohydra, which lives
in estuarine sediments, of4 days at 20-22°e. Protohydra reproduces by division. yb
This gives a value of O.17 per day for r which seems low for this small animal dedaolnwoD
when compared with Hydra. Maybe conditions were not optimal under the cul-
ture conditions. Frank et al. (1957) found r of Daphniapulex to be 0.30 per day.
From the studies of Muus (1967) rough estimates ofr may be calculated for
anumberofbenthicharpacticoids. R, seems to be ofthe magnitude 100(estimated
from the total number ofeggs produced by eachfemale in mixed cultures and the
sex ratio) and generation times are 12to 25 days. This gives values ofr between
0.2 and 0.4. On the basis ofthe studies by Nielsen (1949) and Hopper & Meyers

REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF CILIATES 135
(1966) it seems reasonable to estimate r of small nematodes to be somewhat
smaller - 0.1 to 0.2 - since R, is ofthe same magnitude as that ofharpacticoids
but T is higher (from 20 days to more than a month). The relatively small varia-
tion in reproductive potentials within the micro-metazoa (the "meiofauna")
could be expected since the "group" is per definition of a restricted size range.
Very small metazoans (rotifers, chaetonotoid gastrotrichs, small turbellarians)
may be expected to have somewhat higher values of r, but no data are available.
Thus r ofthe metazoan microfauna may be estimated to lie between 0.1 and 2102
0.4 per day under optimal conditions at temperatures around 20DC. The corre-
spondingA.-valuesrenderthese values intelligible. Thus apopulation of nematodes rebmeceD
can be expected to increase by a factor 1.1-1.2 per day and a population ofhar-
pacticoidscan be expectedto increase by a factor 1.2to 1.5perday under optimal
conditions. For comparison populations of ciliates will, at 20DC, increase by a 22
factor between 1.4 and about 1000 per day according to the species. The very 71:10
large ciliates like Condylostoma play a relatively small quantitative role in most
microfaunalcommunitiesin comparisonto smallerspecies. Thedominatingciliate ta
species in fine sand are ofthe size range 5X 103 to 5X 104 p.3,thus the reproduc- ]lehcneF
tive rates ofthe dominating species will be 1.0-2.8 (r, per day) or 2.5-20 (A., per
day). The very small ciliateslike Uronema dominatethefirst phases of successions
on decaying organic material, but under other conditions they often playa rela- moT
tively small quantitative role.
rM[
The relatively high values of r for Hydra and Daphnia when compared with
the estimates ofr for harpacticoids, nematodes andProtohydra are probably due ,]yrarbiL
to the fact that the former are well known laboratory animals especially cultured
to find the maximal value of r while the latter have been kept in uncontrolled
mixed cultures. It must also be stressed again that the values ofr for the latter ytisrevinU
forms are only rough estimates based on partly inadequate data.
It is believed that exact evaluations of r for a larger number of metazoans
inhabiting microfaunal communities would be a great advance for the under-
negahnepoC[
standing ofthese communities since this will render it possible to make relevant
comparisons ofthe reproductive potentials between different species and groups
oforganisms. Such evaluations can probably now be made without great difficul-
ties since culture methods are beingdevelopedfor a large numberofforms (Hop-
