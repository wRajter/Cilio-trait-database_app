ABSTRACT: We investigated whether the common heterotrophic dinoflagellates Gyrodinium domi-
nans, Oxyrrhis marina,Pfiesteria piscicida, Polykrikos kofoidii, Protoperidinium bipesand Stoecke-
ria algicida, and the naked ciliate Strombidinopsissp., were able to feed on the mixotrophic red-tide
dinoflagellate Gymnodinium aureolum (GenBank accession no. FN392226). We also measured the
growth and ingestion rates of G. dominans, O. marina, P. kofoidii, and Strombidinopsis sp. on G.
aureolumas a function of prey concentration. We calculated grazing coefficients by combining field
data on abundance of small Gyrodinium spp. (25 to 35 µm in cell length) and Strombidinopsis spp.
(>70µm) and co-occurring G. aureolumwith laboratory data on ingestion rates obtained in this study.
G. dominans, O. marina, P. kofoidii, and Strombidinopsis sp. were able to feed on G. aureolum,
whereas P. piscicida, P. bipes, and S. algicidawere not. The maximum growth rates of G. dominans,
O. marina, Strombidinopsis sp. and P. kofoidii on G. aureolum were 0.92, 0.71, 0.44 and 0.11 d–1,
respectively. However, the maximum ingestion rates of G. dominanson G. aureolum(2.0 ng C preda-
tor–1d–1) were comparable with that of P. kofoidii(2.3 ng C predator–1d–1), but much lower than that
of Strombidinopsissp. (69.7 ng C predator–1d–1). Calculated grazing coefficients for small heterotro-
phic Gyrodinium spp. and large Strombidinopsis spp. on G. aureolum were up to 0.40 d–1 and
0.25d–1, respectively (i.e. up to 33 and 22% of G. aureolumpopulations were removed by small Gyro-
diniumand Strombidinopsispopulations in 1 d, respectively). The results of the present study suggest
that small Gyrodiniumspp. and Strombidinopsissp. sometimes have considerable grazing effect on
populations of G. aureolum.
