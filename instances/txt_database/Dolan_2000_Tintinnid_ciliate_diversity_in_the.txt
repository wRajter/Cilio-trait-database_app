ABSTRACT: Globally, north-south gradients in diversity are well known, and in the world ocean they
have been related to north-south gradients in water column structure. Here diversity in planktonic
ciliates, both taxonomic and morphological, is explored in the Mediterranean Sea, which displays
west-east gradients in the water column characteristics of chlorophyll concentrations and distribu-
tions. Tintinnids, which are loricate planktonic ciliates, were enumerated and identified in samples
from 23 stations between 2 and 32°E, obtained from the Catalan Sea in June 1993 and from a cross-
Mediterranean transect in May–June 1996. From west to east, concentrations of tintinnids showed little
variability, while numbers of species and genera, as well as diversity indices (H’values), increased.
These parameters were positively related to depths of the chlorophyll maximum layer and negatively
correlated with chlorophyll concentrations. Corresponding to the west to east increases in diversity
were increases in community averages of lorica oral diameter and overall length, again positively cor-
related to deepening of chlorophyll maximum depths, and negatively related to average chlorophyll
concentrations. Morphological diversity was related to species diversity, not as variability in lorica oral
diameters, but as variability in average lorica length. In the Mediterranean Sea, a gradient of taxo-
nomic and morphological diversity is relatable to a specific feature of the water column, the depth of
the chlorophyll maximum layer. Trophic specialization as a dominant mechanism underlying diver-
sity was not supported by data on lorica oral diameters.

Both the general trend and magnitude of the
diversity gradient (an increase from 10 to 30 spe-
cies with a chlorophyll decrease from about 400
to 100 ng l–1) agree with the few comparative
data which exist from the Atlantic. Specifically,
along a south to north transect of 16 stations
between 58 and 34°S at about 53°W in the aus-
tral spring, numbers of tintinnid species per sta-

decreases in average chlorophyll concentrations
from approximately 1000 to 200 ng l–1(appendix
species list and Fig. 2 in Thompson et al. 1999).
Similarly, recently constructed maps of the spe-
cies abundance of planktonic foraminifera show,
for the same area of the Atlantic Ocean, a south
to north increase from about 10 to 20 species
(Fig. 2a in Rutherford et al. 1999).

Dolan: Tintinnid ciliate diversity in the Mediterranean Sea 75
For example, increases in planktonic diversity
with increasing water column structure have
been explained as resulting from the potential
existence of a larger number of distinct ecologi-
cal niches along the vertical axis (Rutherford et
al. 1999). However appealing an explanation
this sounds, the underlying mechanism remains
undefined and the obvious candidate of trophic
specialisation may not be dominant. Analyses of
copepod community structures suggest that
trophic specialisation may be much less impor-
tant than predation in maintaining diversity, and
predation pressure simply may be stronger in a
structured compared to a well-mixed water col-
umn (e.g., McGowan & Walker 1979, 1985,
Longhurst 1985).

It should be recalled that correlations of envi-
temperature at 5 m for the SW Atlantic Ocean during the austral
ronmental parameters with gradients of diver-
spring (data from Thompson et al. 1999) and the Mediterranean Sea
sity often have little explanatory power (Rohde during spring (this study), compared to predicted number of species
1999). For example, the north-south gradient in from the ‘Species vs Sea Surface Temperature’ of Rutherford et al.
(1999, their Fig. 2b) established for foraminifera based on satellite-
foraminiferal diversity is best correlated with
measured annual sea surface temperature. The Rutherford et al.
