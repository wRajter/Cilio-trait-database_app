Acta Protozool. 2004 (Suppl.) 43: 1
Preface of Chief Editor
This special issue of Acta Protozoologica is dedicated to Alfred Kahl (1877-1946), one of the most outstanding
protozoologists who ever lived. It was initiated and partially financed by Prof. Wilhelm Foissner, an enthusiastic
ciliatologist who discovered, together with Prof. Fritz Wenzel, a forgotten monograph of Kahl. I appreciate not only
the facsimile reproduction of this monograph, but also Kahl’s biography, which is surprisingly short (Corliss 1978).
Thanks to the authors for the new data and for translating some important passages of Kahl’s papers. They show
not only Kahl’s scientific thinking, but also that some of our “new” questions and problems are, indeed, not as “new”
as we thought.

Preface of Authors
Bibliographies and general wisdom suggest that Kahl’s last publication appeared in 1935 (Kahl 1935, Corliss
1978). Thus, it was a great surprise for the junior author when Prof. Wenzel showed him a Kahl monograph from
1943. Wenzel got the monograph as a subscriber of the Mikrokosmos, a widely distributed and still alive journal
for amateur microscopists, presently edited by Prof. Klaus Hausmann (Berlin University). The Mikrokosmos
publishers distributed a book addendum to the subscribers biannually. The addendum for the year 1943 was the first
part of Kahl’s “Infusoria”, the second was planed to be published in volume 38 (1944), but did not appear due to
the second war troubles, that is, the Mikrokosmos ceased for four years, and the first issue of volume 38 appeared
only in October 1948. However, we cannot exclude that Kahl’s manuscript still is in private or public archives.
Likewise, we do not know whether further copies exist of part 1. A search in the web, kindly performed by Prof.
Helmut Berger, did not reveal any offer for the 1943/44 book supplement of the Mikrokosmos, but it is likely that
it is available in some of the large libraries. Indeed, Prof. Klaus Hausmann, one of the reviewers, recognized that
he has the monograph in his records. However, he could not assign it to a certain author because Kahl’s name was
not mentioned on the article! Professor Hausmann got the monograph together with a complete Mikrokosmos
series from an old amateur microscopist rather recently.
Kahl is still a very prominent ciliatologist due to his unsurpassed and invaluable monographs, summarizing the
existing knowledge and adding thousands of excellent figures. His keys were even translated into English by
Patterson (1978). Thus, Kahl deserves the honour that his last publication becomes distributed more widely,
especially because it contains several new species and many improved figures arranged to nice plates.
We and the present Mikrokosmos publisher were unable to locate the copyright holder. Copyright of Kahl’s
article ends in 2013. Thus, Wilhelm Foissner declares that he will compensate for all financial claims of the present
re-print.
Nine years ago, one of us discovered Dumont’s forgotten monographs, containing hundreds of new protist
species (Foissner 1995). Now, a forgotten monograph of Kahl is brought to light. How many are waiting to be
discovered, especially in the old Russian and Asian literature?
We warmly thank Prof. Jerzy Sikora for giving us the possibility to distribute Kahl’s last monograph to a wide
audience.

Summary. The facsimile presentation of a forgotten ciliate monograph of Alfred Kahl from the year 1943 is a convenient occasion for a
detailed biography of this outstanding ciliate researcher. Kahl was born in the village of Warwerort, that is, at the north coast of Germany
on 18th February 1877. Nothing is known about his parents and youth. At the turn of the century, when Kahl was twenty, he became a
primary school master; later, he taught English, French, and natural history in a Gymnasium (high school) in Hamburg, where he married
and had a daughter, who initiated, as a student of the famous Eduard Reichenow, his microscopic studies.
Kahl published his first paper, a monograph with 241 pages, in the year 1926, when he was nearly fifty. In the following nine years, Kahl
produced 1800 printed pages, containing, inter alia, the descriptions of 17 new ciliate families, 57 new genera, about 700 (!) new species,
and thousands of excellent pen- and -ink drawings. Although Kahl had contact with several academic protozoologists, such as E. Reichenow
and H. Kirby, he was a self-made man working alone and performing his meticulous live observations with a simple bright field microscope
equipped, however, with a 100:1 oil immersion objective. Kahl did not only excellent original research, but also thorough taxonomic revisions.
This culminated in the 1930-35 monographs in Dahl’s Die Tierwelt Deutschlands series. These four reviews, which bring together and freshly
characterize most ciliates known to that time, soon became “classics” and are Kahl’s most important scientific legacy. Kahl’s meticulous
observations and phylogenetic ideas also influenced the higher classification of the ciliates, though this is less obvious than for species
taxonomy.
After 10 years of intense work, Kahl abruptly stopped publishing in 1935, possibly because of problems with some academic
protozoologists and zoologists. However, his reviews in the Tierwelt Deutschlands series soon made him famous throughout the
protozoological landscape. This might have stimulated him to commence work again in the early forties, when he produced a revision of
the 1930-35 monographs. The revision should be a book addendum for the subscribers of the Mikrokosmos, a popular journal for amateur
microscopists. Unfortunately, only part 1, here reproduced as a facsimile, was published in 1943, while part 2 was likely lost during the
Second World War troubles. This fine piece of work is not only a simple repetition of the previous reviews, but contains 10 new taxa, the
freshwater species described between 1935 and 1940, several nomenclatural novelities, interesting remarks on various genera, and many
improved figures. Two of the 10 new species were rediscovered recently, and one is redescribed and neotypified here, viz., Phialinides
muscicola (Kahl, 1943) nov. comb.
Kahl used the morphospecies concept and emphasized that ciliate diversity is much greater than previously recognized. This and other
matters caused conflicts with some academic protozoologists, especially A. Wetzel, who disliked Kahl’s simple drawings and splitting of
seemingly very similar species. However, time confirmed Kahl, whose life and work are an impressive example of how to become an
unforgettable taxonomist: excellent original research and revisions, diligence, objectivity, respect for the field’s history and, last but not least,
a good deal of talent. Kahl died in November 1946. The reason and his grave are unknown.
Key words: biography, ciliate species recognition, Ciliophora, Kahl Alfred, neotypification, new ciliate species, Phialina binucleata,
