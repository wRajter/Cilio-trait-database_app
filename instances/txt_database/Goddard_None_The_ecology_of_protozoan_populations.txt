GODDARD, MARIAN R. THE ECOLOGY OF PROTOZOAN POPULATIONS
OF SLOW SAND FILTERS, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE
CILIATES.
ABSTRACT
The protozoan populations of slow sand filter beds, used by
the Metropolitan Water Division of the Thames Water
Authority for the purification of stored water, were studied
over the period of a year. Most of the work was conducted
on beds where the water approached the sand at a flow rate
of 0.4 mh"l, while a bed run at 0.2 mh"^ was used for
comparative studies. Physical and chemical parameters of
the water were monitored by the Thames Water Authority.
A method for the qualitative and quantitative examination
of live protozoa was developed using a sedimentation
technique. The time required for sedimentation limited
the number of samples which could be identified, measured
and counted. These were concentrated on defining the
depth, rather than horizontal, distribution of protozoa as
the bed functions vertically, and samples were taken as
frequently as possible in order to adequately estimate the
population growth rates of the protozoa. Depth distrib­
utions of particulate organic carbon content of the sand
were determined, as an indication of food availability for
the microorganisms, in parallel with the protozoan samples.
The depth distribution of bacteria associated with the sand
grains was also studied, but only over the initial period
of a filter bed run. Scanning electron microscopy was
employed to examine the localised distributions of bacteria
on the sand grain surfaces. The availability of a pilot—
scale sand column enabled interstitial water to be sampled
and analysed for bacteria.
Maximum population densities of ciliates and flagellates,
and variations in mean body size of the ciliates were found
to be related to temperature. Maximum ciliate densities
were also associated with surface accumulation of carbon,
rates of head loss change and, on two occasions, with the
onset of a dissolved oxygen deficit in the filtrate water.
The pattern of density-depth distributions of ciliates and
flagellates varied with time during the filtration runs,
and deeper penetration into the sand occurred in the filter
bed with the faster rate of approach water flow. Rates of
growth of the ciliate and flagellate populations increased
with temperature; the ciliate population Qio equalled 1.6
between 4^ and 20^C. Rates of growth also increased with
flow rate and accummulation of particulate organic carbon
in the filter beds. After maximum densities had been
achieved and the ciliate population was in numerical decline,
the total ciliate biovolume continued to increase, but at a
more gradual rate; this was due to a succession to larger
species during this part of the run.

A high initial growth rate of bacteria, doubling time
equal to 10 hours, was recorded over the first few days
of a filter bed run. Bacterial enumeration in the
interstitial water of the pilot-scale sand column was less
informative, as very little change in density distribution
occurred during the initial part of a run. Oxidation-
reduction profiles of the interstitial water were also
found to change little with time, maintaining a character­
istic increase in potential with depth.

Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION
This investigation was one of a series of research
projects which have been pursued by students of
Dr. A. Duncan of the Zoology Department of Royal Holloway
College, in collaboration with the Metropolitan Water
Division of the Thames Water Authority, formerly the
Metropolitan Water Board before the reorganisation in
1974. Most of this research has involved investigations
concerning the phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish
populations of reservoirs belonging to the Thames Water
Authority, but more recent studies have been concerned
with slow sand filtration. Slow sand filters are costly
to operate, mainly due to their high cleaning costs; so it was
decided (Metropolitan Water Board Report No. 45, 1971 - 1973)
that in order to assess the management changes likely to
produce improved output and performance, it was necessary
to know what was actually going on within the filter bed
sand. Lloyd (1974) described the dominant microfauna and
meiofauna present in the slow sand filter beds at Ashford
Common and Walton Treatment Works, and investigated their
depth distributions and food relations. He also examined
the effect of increased flow rate on the depth distributions
of the meiofauna. Lodge (1979), working at Royal
Holloway College, investigated the ecology of the meio-
faunal populations in the slow sand filters at Hampton
Treatment Works where the present study was also carried
out. She devised a sampling technique to allow collection
of samples from an operational filter bed, and described
the spatial and temporal variations of the meiofaunal
populations within the slow sand filter. She also

19
designed a model filter column, used in the present study
for enumeration of interstitial bacteria, which would
allow the measurement of parameters which could not be
obtained from an operational bed, particularly those
required for energetic and respiratory studies.
The main aims of the present investigation were:
(a) To study the depth distribution of the protozoa
and describe their seasonal and temporal variations.
(b) To assess the role of the protozoan population in
the purification of water passing through the bed.
Various physico-chemical parameters were monitored
by the Metropolitan Water Division, as they have been for
some years, throughout the study and an attempt was made
to determine whether changes occurring in the protozoan
population of the filter bed sand were related to
variations of these parameters measured in the top water
and filtrate.
As many of the ciliates and flagellates are
bacteriovorous, a study was also made of the colonisation
of the filter bed sand by bacteria, particularly during
the early part of a filtration run, when ciliate densities
were found to be low.
Although no conclusion as to the role which protozoa
may play in the purification of water could be extracted
from the study, many interrelationships were found
between temperature, dissolved oxygen, carbon content,
flow rate and head loss data of the filter bed and the
concurrent changes in protozoan and particularly ciliate
populations within the filter bed sand.

Chapter 2 Slow sand filtration
The historical development of slow sand filtration
has been described in considerable detail by Lloyd (1974)
and summarised by Lodge (1979). In Britain, the first
record of the use of slow sand filtration was for the
treatment of bleachery waste in Paisley, Scotland in 1804;
the purified water was subsequently sold to the public
(BcLker, 1948). James Simpson installed the first slow
sand filter to treat water for public supply at the Chelsea
Water Company in 1829, and since this introduction they have
been used throughout the area now covered by the Metropolitan
Water Division of the Thames Water Authority (MWD).
Water purification is generally achieved by a
selected combination of chemical flocculation, sedimentation,
microstraining, and rapid and slow sand filtration. The
MWD employ a primary filtration step of either microstraining
or rapid sand filtration, followed by slow sand filtration.
At Hampton Treatment Works, which was used for the present
study, rapid sand filtration of water supplied from local
storage reservoirs in the Staines area is followed by slow
sand filtration, and finally the water is chlorinated before
being pumped into public supply.
Rapid sand filters operate at a higher flow rate
than slow sand filters; the two rates are generally about
600 cm hr”^ and 20 cm hr”^ respectively. Larger particles
suspended in the inflow water are removed by mechanical
straining as the water passes through the relatively coarse
sand of the rapid sand filters. The sand is washed

21
regularly by a reversed, upwards flow of water and air,
which washes the filtered material into overflow channels.
The only biological process to occur in rapid sand
filtration is a certain amount of nitrification of the
free ammonia present, which is performed by nitrifying
bacteria associated with the surface film on the sand
grains.
2.1 Structure, maintenance and function of slow sand
filters
Structure
Figure 2.1 shows a transverse section through a slow
sand filter bed. The supernatant water passes through the
sand layer, which varies between 0.8 and 0.5m (30 to 18 ins.)
deep, at a rate of 0.2 to 0.4 m hr”^ (8 to 16 ins. hr”^).
It then percolates through the gravel,which supports the sand,
through the porous base of the filter bed and into the
underdrains. The flow of water is controlled by a valve
which determines the rate of flow of the filtrate.
The flow of water through a filter bed depends on
three factors (Fig. 2.2): the raw water head (Hi), the
filtrate water head (Hg) and the rate of filtration, or
velocity of flow (V^). These factors are related,
accordingly to Darcy’s Law by the equation:
Vf (Hi - Hg)
where CK depends on the hydraulic characteristics of the
bed including grain size but most importantly including
clogging of the interstices with filtered material and

algal growths. This clogging of mainly the surface layers
of sand increases with the length of a filtration run and
depresses the value of c<.

In order to maintain a steady rate of filtration it
is usual to keep constant and to adjust the exit head
Hg by opening the valve controlling the filtrate flow to
compensate for the decrease in Thus is decreased
during a filtration run and the head loss of the bed
(H^ - Hg) simultaneously increases. Head loss is
measured manometrically as the difference between the
height of a column of water supported by the raw water,
H^, and the column supported by the filtered water pressure,
Hg. The rate of head loss change,A (H^ - H^ )/At, was
recorded during the present study as it was a parameter of
the filter bed which varied during the different runs and
seasonally between runs.

24
Maintenance
After a certain length of time during a filtration
run, the head loss reaches the limit of 1.5 to 2,0 m, and
filter cleaning becomes necessary. This is achieved by
draining the filter bed and skimming the top 2 to 3 cm
(1 in.) of the sand surface (Plate 2.1), The bed may only
be cleaned in this way about 12 times, as the effective filter
depth is reduced on each occasion, so that after 12 cleanings
it has been reduced by 1 foot, and resanding becomes
necessary.
Filter beds are resanded by a trenching operation.
The remaining 18 ins. of mature sand in one strip of the bed
is dug out, and clean sand (12 ins. deep) is placed in the
trench. The mature sand in the strip next to this is
placed on top of the clean sand and the trench thus made
is again filled with clean sand. This process is continued
until the bed has been completely resanded.
In situ sand washers which do not involve the
removal of sand from the filter bed have been described by
Laval (1952) and Lewin (1961). BurmanandLewin (1961)examined
some of the biological effects of both types of cleaning
operation on subsequent filtration runs, and found that
algal regrowth occurred more rapidly on those beds where
the sand was cleaned in situ.
Function
Slow sand filters have been found to be extremely
effective at reducing colour, turbidity and taste in

25

26
addition to bacterial and viral densities and traces of
many organic chemicals in the supernatant filter water
(Kemna, 1899; Pascoe, 1956; Burman, 1962; Metropolitan
Water Board Report Nos. 43 1967 - 1968, 44 1969 - 1970,
45 1971 - 1973). Mechanisms put forward for the removal
of these impurities from the water include physical
filtration, surface force mechanisms, and chemical and
biological activity. Gravity is a significant removal
mechanism for microscopic particles of greater density than
water Ctves and Gregory, 1967), as they collect preferentially on
the top surface of the grains, while particles of a
density similar to water may be brought, by hydrodynamic
forces, in to contact with a grain surface. In order for
the particles to be removed from the laminar flow of water
within the sand, they must adhere to the sand grain once
they have gained contact.
The forces between the sand grain and low density
particles may arise from the overlap of electrical double
layers or from interactions of van der Waals forces. At
the boundary between a sand grain and the interstitial water,
a dilute solution of ions, the sand surface carries a
negative charge which is balanced by an appropriate number
of positively charged ions in the adjacent solution,
forming what is known as an electrical double layer.
Particles in the solution have a similar double layer,
and since the sand surfaces and the great majority of
colloidal impurities in water have negative charges, the
double layer interaction will usually be one of repulsion.
However, this depends on the concentration of dissolved
salts in the water, and in Thames Water, the range of

27
electrical repulsion will only be about 10"^ cm (Ives and
Gregory, 1967). At this range, the attractive forces of
the van der Waals type become significant and may overcome
the repulsion. These are the universal attractive forces
between atoms and molecules (Ives and Gregory, 1966) and
act over a range of about 5 X 10”^ cm.
Pascoe (1956) suggested that the sand particles
possessed a small positive charge resulting from the breaking
of the SiOg lattice, and that his observation of adsorption
of negatively charged bacteriophages to the sand grains,
was due to the attractive electrostatic forces between
the phage and grains.
The main stream of water passing through the filter
bed flows in a path through the centre of the interstices,
the velocity of flow decreasing, due to frictional forces,
closer to the sand grains (Ives, 1980). Consequently,
flattened ciliates, characteristic protozoan fauna of this
environment, are able to live in close association with the
grains and their surface bacterial colonisation without being
constantly swept along in the filter bed water.
The importance of biological processes on the
efficiency of slow sand filtration has not been examined
as thoroughly as the physical effects. Kemna (1899)
suggested that biological mechanisms occurring at the sand
surface contributed greatly to the purification of water and
Burman (1962) described the formation of a zoogloeal layer
on the surface of the filter, which was thought to be mainly
responsible for bacterial removal, as one of the most import­
ant factors in the efficient performance of a slow sand filter

28
A complex biological community has been found to develop
in the filter beds, including bacteria, algae, protozoa,
rotifers, oügochaetes and other macrofauna (Bellinger, 1968;
Lloyd, 1974; Lodge, 1979), The contribution which many
of the flora and fauna make to the purification of the
filter bed supernatant is not well understood as research
has been mainly concerned with only the bacterial and algal
populations.
2.2 Biology of slow sand filtration
Immediately following the cleaning and recharging
of a filter bed, the filtration is limited to its mechanical
action of straining, but after a few days the filter bed becomes chemically
and biologically active at the water/sand interface with the
development of algae and bacteria. Kemna (1899) likened the
bacterial slimes to a spider’s web: the’microbes becoming
caught in the slimy layer on the surface of each grain of
sand’. The river water abstracted from the Thames to
supply the storage reservoirs has a particulate organic
carbon (P.O.C.) content of between 1,000 and 12,OOOyjgl
This is reduced by 7 5% during storage so that the feed
water to the primary filters has a P.O.C. content of 250
to 3,OOCyig C l”^. This is further reduced by the rapid
sand filtration to 25 to 300yug C 1 ^ in the feed water to
the slow sand filters. With such low concentrations of
organic material as are present in the primary filtered
water the only possible means for rapid biological action
and removal of impurities is in the presence of solid
surfaces enabling the surface concentration of nutrients
and bacteria. Consequently the development of the

29
bacterial slime on the sand surfaces provides a perfect
site for biological oxidation to take place (Heukelekian
and Heller, 1940),
Bacterial accumulation has been observed at the sand
surface of slow sand filters (Burman and Lewin, 1961) and a
7 —1
rapid reduction in densities from 10 g" sand at the surface
4 -1
to 10 g sand was found to occur in the top 10 to 15 cm
with little further reduction occurring down to 100 cm
(Schmidt, 1963). The interstitial bacterial density,
however, decreased exponentially with depth throughout
the top 100 cm of sand. Lodge (1979) who studied the
depth distributions of meiofauna, particulate organic
carbon, dissolved oxygen and redox conditions in slow sand
filter beds also found that biological activity, measured
as oxygen consumption per g carbon, was far greater per
unit weight of carbon in the upper 2 cm of sand than it
was at depths between 2 and 5 cm and at depths below 5 cm,
with mean daily consumption rates of 0.6, 0.08 ard 0.01 g Og
g“^C respectively.
Studies on the algal flora of slow sand filter beds have
shown diatoms to be the dominant colonisers of the filter
bed sand surface (Kemna, 1899; Brook, 1953; Bellinger, 1968),
with a few of the smaller species, less than 35^maximum
dimension, able to penetrate through the top 2" of sand, e.g.
Stephanodiscus astraea and Navicula sp. (Bellinger, 1968).
Kemna described a theory, attributed to Strohmeyer,
suggesting that a moderate evolution of gas by the filamentous
algae keeps them just above the sand surface, so that
they do not clog the interstices of the filter bed, and at
the same time perform a preliminary straining of the water.

50
Brook (1954) observed a succession of sand surface algae
occurring during each filter bed run, and after examination
of the gut contents of chironomid larvae, he related this
to increased predation by such insect larvae. Ridley
(1971) however, described the succession of algae during a
summer run as occurring in three stages:
1. Proliferate growth in the supernatant water
during the first seven days.
2. Surface seeding with diatoms and other algae
from the inflow or from those which survived
the cleaning process in the sand, after five
days.
3. Growth of larger filamentous species after
ten days.
Bellinger (1968) also found that diatoms were able
to survive the cleaning process of the filter bed below
the sand surface (i.e. heterotrophically), and to seed
the bed as it was re-filled.
Studies on the predation of algae by protozoa (Brook,
1952) revealed that two ciliate species, Chilodon sp. and
Oxytricha sp. commonly found in the filter beds, were strictly
diatom feeders and that if present in sufficient densities
they could have a marked effect on the composition of the .
algal flora of the bed surface. Protozoa have also been
reported to be very effective in the removal of viruses
from filter bed water (Metropolitan Water Board Report,
No. 44, 1969 T 1970). By examining the feeding rates of
Vorticella spp., Lloyd (1974) concluded that the predation

51
by these ciliates on the interstitial bacteria was a
significant secondary role to the removal of bacteria by
physical adsorption. He observed that predation was 2 to
5 times more efficient at the slower flow rate of 20 cm hr ^
than at 40 cm hr with 55% and 87% of seeded bacteria
removed from an experimental sand cell by 50 and 200
individuals, respectively, of V. campanula at 20 cm hr"^.
The corresponding predation figures at 40 cm hr”^ were 11%
and 39%. Studies by Ritterbusch (1976) similarly concluded
that the metazoan populations of slow sand filters were not of
primary importance in the purification of water passing through
the beds on the basis of chemical analyses conducted on the
water.
Meiofaunal populations of a slow sand filter bed run at
20 cm hr”^ were found to develop very slowly over the first
two weeks of a run (Lodge, 1979), achieving densities of 10 -
3
100, of predominantly oligochaetes, per 40 cm of sand.
Numbers continued to increase slowly throughout a run,
3
reaching highest densities of 1,000 per 40 cm after 8 weeks
of a summer run. Nematodes were not very common, and
chironomids were abundant only at the sand surface during
the summer.
There were very few patterns of meiofaunal depth
distribution although the enchytraeid worms occasionally
exhibited surface avoidance and the nematodes and chironomids
were most abundant at the surface. Little is known of the
feeding habits of these meiofaunal populations although they
appear to graze on detritus, thus consuming bacteria and
probably protozoa associated with this organic debris.

52
Chapter 3 Interstitial Ciliate Ecology
The ciliates are very cosmopolitan in their
distribution, with many common genera represented in the
most diverse of habitats. Three common species
Cyclidium glaucoma. Cinetochilum margaritaceum and
Chilodonella cucullulus have been found in a number of
environments including fresh water,marine, an activated
sludge aeration tank and an Imhoff tank (Lackey, 1938).
Ciliates have been found to dominate the protozoan fauna
of both percolating filters and activated sludge plants
with 53 different species isolated from the former and
67 from the latter (Curds and Cockburn, 1970).
Ciliates are also very common in a number of benthic
environments including brackish water marshes (Webb, 1956)
and freshwater lakes and Scottish lochs (Webb, 1961;
Bryant and Laybourn, 1972/ 1973; Finlay et al, 1979).
Although less common in sand and gravel, ciliates have
been isolated from a number of marine sands including
those of islands off the German and Danish coasts
(Hartwig, 1973) and in the Baltic Sea (Fenchel, 1966).
They have also been recorded in coastal sands of Germany
(Hartwig, 1974), North Yorkshire (Hartwig and Parker, 1977),
Florida (Borror, 1963), Bermuda (Hartwig, 1977), the
Waltair and Orissa coast of India (Rao and Ganapati, 1968;
Rao, 1969), the Caspian Sea (Agamaliev, 1972) and the
White Sea (Burkovsky, 1969). The only reported study of
ciliate populations in fresh water sands and gravels is
that of Ltlpkes (1976) who identified 19 species from the
Fulda-River benthos.

33
Ciliates are well adapted to the interstitial life
of sand environments (Fauré - Fremiet, 1950). In sand
of 0.1 to 0.3 mm particle diameter, the microporal ciliates
have certain general characteristics: they are
thigmotactic, the adorai membranelle acting as an
adhesive organ and the ciliation allowing them to glide
along surfaces; they also have a flattened and often
elongated body with a prolonged caudal region, the total
body length reaching up to 3 mm, and some have the ability
to contract the frontal region very rapidly, e.g.
Lacrymaria olor. The mesoporal ciliates, which are found
in medium and coarse sands (particle diameter greater than
0.4 mm) are generally small to medium size and flattened,
swimming alternately very fast and then suddenly stopping
when in contact with a solid surface (Faure-Fremiet, 1951)
e.g. Glaucoma sp. Some typical interstitial species are
euryporal, being widespread in both fine and coarse sands,
while the algal detritus immediately above the sand surface
fosters ciliates generally wider and more circular in cross
section being uniformly ciliated and non-thigmotackic
(Borrar, 1968) e.g. Tetrahymena sp. The ciliates identified
during the present study concurred with the above class­
ification and fell mainly into the microporal and mesoporal
groups.
Fenchel (1978) found that ciliates completely outnum­
bered other individuals of all other species in marine
sand with a median grain size between 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm,
but in sands consisting of larger grains, although they
were more common, they were also accompanied by a rich
metazoan fauna.

34
^ Factors effecting the distribution of interstitial
ciliates
Ciliates are extremely tolerant to wide ranges of
physical and chemical environmental factors including
temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, free carbon
dioxide, ammonia and sulphide (Noland, 1925; Bick, 1957,
1968; Dillon et al 1968; Bick and Kunze, 1971;
Stdssel, 1979). However, Dragesco (1960) concluded that
temperature and salinity, together with grain size, organic
matter content and mechanical agitation of the sand were
important in the control of ciliate distributions.
The availability of sufficient food of the required
type seems to be the most important deciding factor for
successful ciliate colonisation, this being linked in
particular to the state of oxygenation of the sediment.
Fenchel (1969) found that algal feeding ciliates dominated
shallow water marine sands in the summer, the period of
algal growth, while bacterivorous species dominated the
deeper sites all year round, and also the shallower areas
between autumn and spring.
The characteristic vertical zonation of ciliates in
beach sand, with highest densities occurring at the
surface and these decreasing rapidly with depth in the top
few centimetres, was found to correlate with a redox potential
gradient (Fenchel, 1966) and oxygen and sulphide concentra­
tions (Webb, 1961; Burkovsky, 1971). Sands oxidised
throughout, for example those mixed by surf did not show
ci'liahe
these typical! zones which were explained by a
combination of oxygen requirements, tolerance to

35
various reduced chemicals, and specialisation to feed on
microorganisms requiring particular redox conditions.
Indeed, in a study of Scandinavian marine sand (Fenchel,
1967), the largest populations of ciliates were found in
strongly reducing sediments with a rich growth of sulphur
bacteria. Goulder (1974) also found higher populations
at deeper sites in a freshwater lake. However, the
sediment was oxygenated and its highly flocculant nature
provided abundant interstitial space giving both shelter
and a large surface area for bacterial colonisation,and
hence a plentiful food supply for the ciliates.
3.2 Role of ciliates in the decomposition of organic
matter
Ciliates have been reported to enhance the
decomposition of organic matter through a number of direct
and indirect actions. They may stimulate bacterial
decomposition of organic matter in marine and fresh water
sediments by their predation on the bacterial population,
keeping it at a level such that each bacterial cell
performs at its maximum chemical efficiency (Mare, 1942;
Johannes, 1965; Barsdate and Prentki, 1974). Johannes
(1965) found that protozoa directly enhanced the
regeneration of phosphorus in a marine environment, by
excreting that obtained in bacterial food in a form
available for incorporation into primary productivity.
In the absence of such bacterial grazers, nutrients and in
particular phosphates, would become tied up in bacterial
biomass. Curds et al (1968) observed that a reduction
in bacterial density and turbidity of the effluent from

36
a model activated sludge plant corresponded with an
increase in ciliate density. These improvements were
thought to be due to the direct predation on bacteria by
the ciliates in addition to flocculation of the suspended
matter and bacteria caused by ciliate secretions. A
similar effect was recorded by Reid (1969) with
Vorticella spp. in an activated sludge plant. The feeding
currents of the vorticellids are thought to bring the
sludge bacteria into contact with those coated with
mucous secretions produced by the ciliates, thus producing
a more settleable floe and improving the quality of the
effluent.
3.3 Depth distributions of benthic ciliates
Very little data has been published concerning the
variation of ciliate densities with depth in benthic
habitats. Most work has either been largely descriptive
giving information as to the presence or absence of species
at a number of depths, e.g. Lllpkes (1976), or it has been
concerned with the position of the ciliates in a whole
ecosystem relative to other organisms and chemical and
biological factors, e.g. an activated sludge aeration tank
(Curds et al, 1968; Curds, 1971a) or a pond (Bamforth, 1958)
Indeed Fenchel (1966) was the first to describe the vertical
distribution of different ciliate species in the benthic
environment of a brackish water beach.
Where densities of ciliates have been examined with
depth, they have generally been expressed in terms of the
number found in the sampling cores at a certain depth.

37
Consequently, as the diameter of the corers vary, the
resultant densities are not directly comparable.
Highest densities are generally found in the
surf ace cm of all sediments . Fenchel found 98 ciliates per
3
5,3 cm of sand in the top 1 cm of the brackish-water sand
— 3
sediment, while densities as high as 82,895 cm” have
been recorded in the surface cm of sediment in a small
eutrophic loch (Finlay, 1980), Goulder (1971) counted
_ o
5,500 individuals cm” of one species, Loxodes striâtes,
in a freshwater lake sediment, however Bryant and Laybourn
(1972/1973) only recovered 64 ciliates per ml of surface
sediment in Loch Leven. Densities of L. striâtes decreased very
r
rapidly in the j^esh water lake sediment to zero between
2 and 3 cm, although other ciliates did survive down to
4 cm. In the brackish-water sand sediment, the densities
3
decreased to 3 ciliates per 5.3 cm of sand between.7 and
8 cm, Ciliates have been recorded down tol2 cm in a
marine sediment (Agamaliev, 1970), however in the fresh
water habitat of the Fulda River sand and gravel bottom,
Lüpkes (1976) found 3 ciliates: Trachelophyllum sp..
Haplocaulus sp. and Epistylis sp. as deep as 50 cm.

Chapter 4 Methods
Section A. Critique of methods used for the examination
of protozoan and bacterial populations
in aquatic benthic environments and
their application to slow sand filters
4.1 Extraction of cores from aquatic sediments
In order to extract cores of sand from an operational
filter bed, the sampling apparatus had to be designed such
that following the removal of a sample, no reduction in the
effective filter depth of sand occurred, i.e. a hole could
not be left in the filter bed sand. The samples had to be
extracted from beneath 1 to 1.5 m of water, in order to
examine temporal changes in population density during a
filtration run, and intact cores of sand were required to
allow depth distributions of the protozoa present to be
determined.
A variety of methods for removing cores from
natural aquatic sediments have been described but none of
these were practicable for the present study. Those
described for sampling sand have generally been developed
for marine or inter-tidal studies and consequently involve
a corer which is pushed into the sand, the upper end is
then sealed tightly with a cork or snap cover, the corer
lifted and the bottom end sealed off similarly (Neel,
1948; Fenchel, 1966, 1967; Hartwig, 1973). A corer
based on the same principle but operable in shallow water
was described by Maitland (1969). All these sampling
devices involve pushing a corer into the benthos.

39
This causes compaction, which could destroy many of the
delicate ciliates, and possible transfer of material from
the surface layers to lower depths in the extracted core,
both of which disturb the vertical distribution of organisms
within the core. These samplers also leave a hole in the
sampled benthos.
To overcome the above problems, Lloyd (1973),
studying the microfauna of slow sand filters, developed a
sampler which was inserted into the filter bed sand while
it was drained for cleaning. This consisted of two strips
of picture glass spaced 1 mm apart and sealed together at
the edges, such that an internal space 1.5 cm X 1 mm ran
the length of the sampler column. A number of these were
filled with clean, dry sand and pushed into the filter bed.
After filtration had commenced a sampler could be removed
from the bed and transferred directly to a microscope for
examination. The main advantage of this technique is that
no compaction of the sand occurred during manipulation of
the sampler. However, there are disadvantages: firstly,
the water flow through the sampler would be disturbed by
the narrow aperture between the glass strips, secondly,
the examination technique would only view animals visible
on the upper surfaces of the sand grains adjacent to the
glass and animals in the centre of the column would easily
be missed and thirdly, the high surface area to volume
ratio of the sampler would alter biological development,
the glass surfaces providing a relatively large surface
area for colonisation.

40
A sampling device which overcame the problems of
Compaction and interference with vertical distribution of
fauna present in a slow sand filter was designed by Lodge
(1979). It could be used during a slow sand filter run,
sampling from a boat without disturbing the filter in any
way which might effect the quality of the water passing
out of the filter. This sampling apparatus which was used
for sampling the meiofauna of slow sand filters proved to be
suitable also for the sampling of protozoa and bacteria ^
in the present study. It is described in detail in
Lodge (1979) and summarised in Section 4.4.2.
The apparatus consisted of a core 100 mm in diameter
filled with sand, which was placed into the filter bed while
it was drained for cleaning. It has been established
(Ives, 1966) that any model filter should have a diameter
of at least 50 times the largest grain size,in order to
render any boundary effects of the apparatus negligible.
As the largest sand grains found in the filter bed sand
were about 5 mm across,the sampling cores should have been
a minimum of 250 mm in diameter. Consequently there may
have been some boundary effects in the cores used.
However, with this in mind, subsamples from the cores were
taken as near to the centre as possible.
This technique of sampling has many advantages;
there is no compaction of the sand during any stage of
sampling and consequently no risk of destroying many of
the ciliates,which are by nature extremely delicate;
samples of known age can be removed from the filter bed as
required, and an accurate depth distribution of organisms

41
in the top 25 to 30 cm of sand may be determined. The
main disadvantage of the sampling cores is that no
horizontal movement is possible between sand inside and
sand outside the core wall; however, as the filter bed
functions vertically this may not be a particularly
important problem, especially at the centre of the core from
where the sub-samples were taken. This lack of potential
for horizontal movement may be more important for the
larger animals, the metazoa, as they are likely to move
further autonomously than the smaller protozoa.
4.2 Removal of protozoa from aquatic substrates
It was necessary to remove the protozoa from the
sand grains in order to count them, as a direct examination
of a sub-sample of sand would result in most of the
protozoa being hidden from view by the grains of sand.
The attached ciliates were counted in this manner, as
they extended about 200jxm from the grains to feed in the
water surrounding them and could be easily seen.
However, the unattached protozoa were either present in
the interstitial water or in close association with the
detritus surrounding the sand grains. A technique was
required which would separate the detritus and interstitial
water from the sand grains without damaging the protozoa,
most of which are extremely fragile organisms.
The majority of sand substrates studied previously
have been from marine environments and the sea-water ice
extraction method of Uhlig (1964) has been widely used for
such samples. Ice is placed on top of the sand sample in
funnel over a collecting dish. As the ice melts a

42
stream of saline water passes through the sand and both
the downward streaming of the water and its salinity gradient
strongly influence the interstitial protozoa, forcing
them out of the sand into the dish of sea water (Uhlig,
1968), As freshwater protozoa are very sensitive to
change in osmotic pressure around them, to adapt this
method to suit them, fresh water ice would need to be
used. The only factor influencing the extraction of
protozoa would be the downward streaming of melt-water and
possibly the slight temperature gradient. I found that
better results could be achieved by pouring water over
the sand, a method which was also less time consuming than
the use of melting ice. Spoon (1972) encouraged the
migration of meiofauna from the sediment in the bottom of
a test-tube to the surface of the overlying water by
bubbling nitrogen or methane gas into the sediment and
then stoppering the tube tightly, a method which may
well be toxic to some of the sensitive protozoa,
Richards (1974), studied the protozoan fauna of
slow sand filters and effected their removal from the
sand by shaking each sample with Chalkley's medium (Kudo,
1971) prior to culturing the supernatant for enumeration
of the protozoa. The grinding action between sand grains
during shaking would probably fragment a large number of
these fragile animals and the dilution culture method also
used by Mare (1942) gives rise to a number of errors.
It assumes that all organisms present in the sample will
give rise to individual populations and that no cysts were
present in the sample which would later increase the number
recorded in culture by their excystment and growth.

43
The technique finally adopted in this study was
based on that of Ute-rmdhl (1958) which he used for counting
phytoplankton. The water sample containing algae was
poured into a sedimentation chamber, left for a suitable
length of time and the bottom plate of the chamber was then
examined on an inverted microscope, and the cells counted.
It was adapted for the present study by passing a gentle
stream of water over the sand, which was held in a muslin
cloth over a collecting vessel. The filtrate containing
detritus and protozoa was then sedimented prior to
examination. The method is described in detail in Section
4.5.2.
4.3 Enumeration of bacteria in suspension
To examine changes in bacterial density within
the filter bed, a technique was needed which removed either
all or a constant proportion of bacteria from the sand
grains into suspension. As sand grains have extremely
uneven surfaces, providing small cracks and niches for
bacteria to colonise, and tend to become partially covered
with slime matrices in which bacteria are enmeshed, it was
more realistic to attempt the removal of a constant
proportion of the bacterial population. Consequently a
standardised technique of shaking the sand sub-sample with
sterile water was used. Once in suspension, a number of
methods were available for bacterial enumeration. These
could be grouped broadly in to those which are direct
counts and those which require cultures of the suspension.
Spread plate cultures, the most probable number technique
of Harris and Sommers (1968) and direct counts using

44
epifluorescence microscopy were evaluated in the present
study and the latter technique was found to give the most
reproducible results.
Culture techniques have been used widely for
enumerating sediment bacteria (ZoBell and Anderson, 1936;
ZoBell, 1938; ZoBell, 1946; Pearse et al, 1942; Boucher
and Chamroux, 1976), however they suffer from the following
disadvantages as far as the counting of whole populations is
concerned; selectivity of media for certain bacterialor
spore development, and the production of one colony by an
aggregate of bacteria. Pour plates may adversely effect
psycrophilic organisms, as 46°C is the gelling temperature
of the agar, a temperature which they must be able to
withstand, while on spread plates ’spreading colonies’
overgrow the surface giving aberrant counts of other colonies
(Collins, 1977), The main advantage of culturing is that
the count represents the number of viable bacteria present
in the sample and is, therefore, a more useful indication
of microbial activity than a total count would be. By
culturing, colonies can also be picked off and sub-cultured
to grow sufficient numbers for identification of the bacteria.
Direct counts only allow identification according to
morphology.
The plate dilution frequency of Harris and Sommers
(1968) is a modification of the most probably number (multiple
tube) technique described by McCrady (1915) and has been
found to be particularly suitable for estimating bacterial
populations in sewage liquors (Pike and Carrington, 1972).
Replicate microsamples are inoculated from a series of
dilutions on to delineated areas on agar plates. The

45
plates are incubated and the occurrence of growth is
recorded for each inoculated area. By referring to most
probable number tables, the microbial population of the
sample is estimated. This method is subject to the same
disadvantages and advantages as the other culture methods,
described above, but presence or absence of growth is
much easier to record than the total number of colonies
present, so estimation using this technique is more expedient.
Direct counts estimate the total numbers of bacteria
present. This would be a disadvantage if using a direct
count to indicate viable bacterial density in a fairly
inactive deep sediment, however in a slow sand filter,
which has the Ainction of removing organic matter from a
constant flow of water passing through it, an estimate of
total bacterial density was assumed to include a high
proportion of active bacteria.
The direct method of Conn (1918), involved adding
soil to gelatin, mixing it and spreading 0.01 ml evenly on
a glass slide to cover 1.0 sq. cm. This was dried,
stained and counted. Jones and Mollison (1948) modified
this technique slightly using a haemocytometer, and Collins
and Kipling (1957) concentrated waterbourne bacteria into
glycerol, and stained and examined them in flat glass capill­
aries of known volume. However, these and the various counting
chambers including Neubauer, Helber and Petroff-Hauser all
7
require cell concentrations greater than 10 per ml in
order for the count to be at all accurate (Collins and
Kipling, 1957), and this magnitude of bacteria was not
generally present in the bacterial suspensions produced in

45
the present study.
The above methods involve counting all stained,
bacterial-shaped objects. Strugger (1948) found that by
staining a soil sample with acridine orange, the bacteria
fluoresced green when viewed under blue light, giving an
excellent contrast against the background detrital particles.
Acridine orange stains DNA and is the most common
fluorochrome used for direct counts of aquatic bacteria
(Hobbie et al, 1972; Francisco et al, 1973; Jones,
1974). A procedure which was based on that described by
Jones and Simon (1975) was adopted for counting the
bacteria extracted from the slow sand filter samples in
this study. It is described later in this chapter
(Section 4.7.2).

4.4.1 Slow sand filter beds used for sampling
The slow sand filter beds used in this study
were Beds 44 and 45 of the Thames Water Authority Water
Treatment Works at Hampton (Plate 4.1). These beds are
in a block of four relatively small sand filters
2
(6,400 m ), and bed 45 has been used for research purposes
prior to this study by the Metropolitan Water Board,
Thames Water Authority and recently by Denise Lodge of
Royal Holloway College, Throughout the period of the
present study, bed 44 was run at a flow rate of 8" or 0.2M
per hour and’bed 45 at 16” or 0.4M per hour.

4.4 .2 Sampling: apparatus
As mentioned earlier the sampling apparatus
and procedure used in this study was that used by Lodge
(1979) for examining the meiofaunal populations of slow
sand filters. It was found to be equally useful for
protozoan sampling initially and at a later date was also
used for studying the bacterial populations.
The apparatus (Plate 4,2) described briefly here
is reported in detail in Lodge (1979), It consisted of
two parts, an inner core and an outer core. The inner
core made from a 31 cm length of grey PVC drainpipe had an
inner diameter of 100 mm and was sawn longitudinally in
half. A base plate, made of clear perspex and drilled
with holes, was attached to one half, and this kept the sand
in the core while allowing the water to flow through
without impedence. The outer core consisted of a 31 cm
length of PVC drainpipe with an inner diameter of 150 mm.
The two halves of the inner core were held together with
two jubilee clips and the split between the halves
covered with plastic adhesive tape, A piece of nylon
cord attached to opposite sides of the lower jubilee clip
passed inside the upper jubilee clip and extended as a loop
above the core, A plastic collar, made by cutting the top
off a plastic filter funnel, fitted tightly over the top
of the core and rested on the top jubilee clip. The inner
core when placed inside the outer core, fitted such that
the plastic collar completely sealed off the gap between
the two cores allowing no water to pass down between them.

49
Plate 4.2 Sampling apparatus : inner and outer cores
with floats attached

50
A polystyrene float was attached to each core by
means of a length of cane and labelled with a letter either
in red (inner core) or yellow (outer core). These floats
were markers to enable location of the cores under the
1 to 1.5 m of water above the sand during a filter bed run.
4.4.3 Core placement
The inner cores were assembled and filled
with washed sand obtained from the sand storage bay at
Hampton. The full cores were placed into an empty tank
and back-charged slowly by gradually filling the tank with
water from a hose. This caused the sand to settle, so more
sand was added until no further settling occurred. The
cores were then transported to the filter bed. In order
to ensure that the cores were positioned randomly in relation
to one another, a system of random co-ordinates from 2 fixed
2
points was used. An area of 250 m was chosen in the centre
of the filter bed, in order to avoid any flow effects or
colonisation from the side walls (Lodge, 1979). Pairs
of random co-ordinates for each core position were taken
from random number tables and the distance of the core site
from two fixed datum points was calculated using Pythagoras's
theorem. Tape measures were tied to poles pushed into
the bed at each datum point and each core position was
then located in the bed.
An outer core was dug in at each site such that its
top edge was level with the filter bed surface, and its
respective inner core was placed inside it so that its
top was also level with the sand surface of bed. The
float belonging to the inner core was then attached to the

51
loop of nylon cord with a paper clip. The filter bed
sand surface was smoothed over to remove all foot prints
and the bed was then ready for backcharging at the
beginning of the next run. Up to 12 cores were dug into
the bed before each filtration run (Plate 4.3).
4.4.4 Sampling procedure
In order that a hole should not be left in
the sand bed when a sample core was removed, reducing the
effective filter depth at that point by 30 cm, an identical
core was inserted into the outer core to replace that
removed for sampling. The replacement core was taken onto
the filter-bed in a flat bottomed boat, the sample core
located by the floats and the use of a diving mask,and
pulled up through the water using a hook on the end of a
pole,which hooked under the loop of nylon string attached
to the inner core. In the boat the float (attached by a
paper clip) was transferred to the replacement core which
was then lowered into the outer core (Plate 4.4). Cores
were collected in this manner at intervals varying from
daily to fortnightly, the daily sampling being necessary
for bacterial monitoring at the start of a run. Protozoa
were sampled at three to four day intervals initially, but
after a few weeks this interval could be lengthened to
weekly and then fortnightly sampling.
At the end of a filtration run, the bed was drained
for cleaning. All the cores were removed before cleaning
could commence and the holes filled with clean sand from
the storage bays. The apparatus was then dismantled
cleaned and repaired if necessary. The time interval

between the end of one run and the beginning of the next
was usually two to three days.
4.4.5 Treatment of sample (Figure 4.1)
The inner core was taken to the side of
the filter bed and sectioned immediately. The collar and
jubilee clips were removed and two perspex hemicircles
placed on the sand surface on each half of the core to
prevent sand spillage. The core was then placed on its
side in two wooden supports, the adhesive tape removed
and the core cut in to halves using a cheese wire which
was pulled through the slits in the plastic core. The
halves were then put into a frame and sectioned one at a
time. A rectangular piece of perspex (30 X 12 X 0.6 cm)
with slits drilled in it at 1 cm intervals was placed over
the half core. Aluminium slicers could just pass through
these slits when pushed vertically downwards. Both halves
of the core were cut in this way (Plate 4.5) into cm
sections by the side of the bed so that no vertical
migration could subsequently occur within the sand. Each
sliced half core was placed in the bottom of a tank covered
with polythene and a damp cloth and transported rapidly
back to the laboratory. On arrival, the cm sections were
2
further subsectioned using a brass corer of 1 cm cross
3
section giving sub-samples of 1 cm . The sub-samples were
taken as near to the centre of the core as possible to
avoid any edge effects caused by faster flow down the
sides of the core. Three subsamples from each depth
were taken for particulate organic carbon (P.G.C.)
determinations, one from the following eight depths: 1 cm;
2 cm; 4 cm, 7 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, 20 cm and 25 cm was counted

for protozoa, and for bacterial determinations two
replicates at each of five depths : 1 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm,
20 cm and 25 cm were counted. The sub-samples for
protozoan and bacterial analyses were kept in a haemo-
cytometer tray covered with a sheet of parafilm, to prevent
dessication, and stored in a 7^C refrigerator for the
short period prior to analysis. The subsamples for P.O.C.
determination were dried in glass vials at 80^C for 24
hours, they were then capped and stored until analysed.
4.5 Examination of protozoa
Direct counts of live protozoa were made within
24 hours of sampling; this minimised errors caused by
replication, predation or natural mortality. The
protozoa were counted live as they are more easily
identified live than when fixed, fixed specimens tending
to lose their characteristic shape, and many may not even
survive the fixation procedure intact. Further advantages
of counting live animals are that their movement aids the
differentiation between the animal and the detritus with
which most are associated, and many also have a very
characteristic type of movement which helps in identification.
A technique was required which would extract the
protozoa from the sand grains without agitation of the
sand, as this could well destroy many of the fragile
organisms, but which would remove all unattached protozoa
from around the grains and concentrate them for counting.
Utermbhl's method of examining sedimented cells by means of an
inverted microscope (ptermôhl, 1958) satisfied these requirements

58
and was therefore adopted. A large sedimentation
chamber (100 ml) was needed so that the sand
sub-sample could be thoroughly washed with 100 ml
of protozoa-free water which was then allowed to sediment.
The ciliates which remained attached to the sand grains
were counted separately under a binocular microscope.
4.5.1 Sedimentation apparatus
The sedimentation apparatus (Fig. 4.2) is
marketed by E. Leitz Ltd, for the concentration of plankton,
prior to counting with a Wild M40 'Inverted Biological
Microscope*. It was found to be useful in the present
study, for counting live protozoa. It is constructed in
perspex and consists of a sedimentation chamber with a
capacity of 100 ml, around the base of which a square
base plate is bonded, and a plate chamber having the same
dimensions as the base plate, with a hole of 28 mm diameter
in the centre. The plate chamber received the settled
organisms. A coverslip (30 mm diameter) is held into the
bottom of the plate chamber by a metal ring which screws
into the perspex wall of the chamber. This seal was made
watertight by smearing soft paraffin wax on the edge of the
coverslip before screwing the ring into place. Any excess
wax on the coverslip was removed with alcohol. The join
between the sedimentation chamber and plate chamber was
also made watertight using paraffin wax.
In order to examine the sedimented organisms under
an inverted microscope, the sedimentation chamber had to
be removed from the plate chamber without disturbing or
mixing the contents of the two. This was achieved by
sliding the sedimentation chamber onto an accessory plate,

a plate of solid perspex having the same dimensions as
the plate chamber, while a second accessory plate was slid
over the plate chamber from a third plate on the opposite
side of the chamber (Fig, 4.2). All joins between the
accessory plates, and chambers were sealed with paraffin
wax so that no water could escape from the sedimentation
chamber and the contents of the plate chamber were undisturbed
The chamber was then transferred directly to an inverted
microscope for examination and counting of the sedimented
organisms,
4.5.2 Sedimentation procedure
3
A 1 cm sample of sand was removed from the
haemocytometer tray, in which it had been stored for a
maximum of 24 hours after sampling, and placed on a double
thickness of muslin cloth in a filter funnel, over an
100 ml measuring cylinder. 100 mis of protozoa-free sand
filter water,were poured gently over the sand, so that a
continuous stream of water passed through it, leaving the
filter funnel at a rate of about two drops per second.
(The water had been collected from the filter bed at the
time of sampling and prefiltered through a Whatman GF/C
glass fibre filter to remove all protozoa). The filtrate
was immediately transferred to the sedimentation apparatus,
covered and left to stand for 5 hours at 7^C.
A few of the very fine grains of sand were washed
through the muslin and these remained in the measuring
cylinder during the transfer of water to the sedimentation
chamber. These grains were then washed into a petri dish using
prefiltered filter bed water. The washed sand in the muslin

61
was also transferred to this petri-dish which was then
examined under a Nikkon binocular microscope, at a
magnification of X 40, for sessile ciliates and any free-
swimming protozoa which occasionally escaped the washing
treatment.
After five hours, the protozoa in the plate chamber
were counted under a Wild M40 inverted microscope at a
total magnification of X 235. The whole area of the
coverslip was covered systematically, traversing backwards
and forwards using the mechanical stage. Ciliates were
all identified to genus level and some of the more common
species were identified using Kahl (1930 - 1935). The
length and width of the first five individuals encountered
of each species were measured using a micrometer eye piece.
This counting process took from 1|- to 2 hours per sample.
All counts were expressed as no. cm” of sand. In some
samples, one or two species were extremely common, i.e.
100 cm” ; in such cases these species would only be
counted in half the chamber, and would be ignored while
counting the second half. Pairs of counts from both
halves of the chamber were tested using rank correlation
for a number of different species and no significant
difference was found between them (p = 0.01).
4,5.3 Efficiency of sedimentation procedure
The washing procedure removed most of the
detritus from the sand sample and in a few sub—samples, with
high densities of detritus, it proved necessary to dilute
the filtrate prior to sedimentation and counting.
Detrital material was the main source of inefficiency in the

62
counting of protozoa, but it was necessary to wash the
detritus into the filtrate, as many of the cilates lived
in close association with it, and would otherwise have
been overlooked. The efficiency of the washing technique
was tested by washing the same sample of sand with successive
100 ml aliquots of filtered sand water, and sedimenting
and counting these. After the third washing, the sand
was examined thoroughly for any remaining protozoa. The
extraction efficiency of the first washing was shown to be
93% for the ciliates and 72% for the flagellates (Table
4.1).
The duration of sedimentation was kept to 5 hours
as this was the longest time possible in order for the
eight sub-samples to be sedimented within 24 hours of
sampling, using the three sedimentation columns available
and allowing two hours for each chamber to be counted.
The efficiency of the sedimentation period was tested by
setting up a sedimentation as described above and leaving
it for five hours. The sedimentation chamber was then
transferred to a second plate chamber for a further two
hours, then to a third for two more hours and finally to
a fourth for a further thirty-six hours, by which time all
the protozoa were assumed to have sedimented out. The
results of this test are shown in Table 4.2. The
efficiency of ciliate sedimentation as a whole was 81%
over the first five hours, however the free swimming
species, Cvclidium hentatrichum, was only removed with 59%
g^^^ciency, while the species associated with the detritus
were removed to a far greater degree e.g. 84/o for
Cinetochilum marpraritaceum. The low sedimentation

63
of the amoebae may be due to thigmotaxis
against the side of the sedimentation chamber.
Taking into account both washing and sedimenting
processes, the overall counting efficiency for ciliates
was 75%,

4.6 Examination of the replicability of the sampling
programme
During the series of runs examining the spatial
and temporal distribution of protozoa, the sedimentation
time of 5 hours and the counting time of 1^ to 2 hours
involved in processing each cm sub-sample, made it
possible to examine only 1 sub-sample per core-depth in
one core of sand removed per sampling day. It was there­
fore necessary to determine whether the data recorded in
the one sub-sample analysed, was representative of the
other cores present in the filter bed. There was no
possibility of testing the replicability of normal
sampling by counting 10 cores taken simultaneously,

65
because of the time involved in processing these, so it
was necessary to devise a special sampling programme
for this purpose and it was decided to replicate 10
cores of the same age (14 days) but taken on different
dates, to allow for the handling and counting time.
Two cores were taken on each date and three replicate
sub-samples taken from the centre of each core were counted
at one depth only, 10 cm; this enabled both within core
and between core variability to be tested. Three
replicates at the 10 cm depth in each core were also
analysed for organic carbon to test for within and between
core carbon variability.
The sampling programme was organised in the
following way:- 10 initial cores were inserted into the
bed at the start of a run and these were replaced by new
initial cores over a period of two weeks, so that 14-day-
old cores could be removed for counting at intervals,
allowing sufficient time for each count (Fig. 4.3).
Although all the cores were 14 days old, the dates
of removal and so the conditions of the bed over each two
week period were different, subjecting the samples to an
unavoidable extra variability. The temperature remained
fairly constant around 13°C but the flow rate, head loss,
dissolved oxygen level, source of supply water and the
degree of algal cover on the bed varied. Initially the
bed received half of its water from the King George VI
reservoir and half from the Queen Elizabeth II reservoir,
but by the final sampling date 40% of the supply was still
from the Queen Elizabeth II, but the remaining 60% was
from Wraysbury reservoir. Changing the supply source

to the bed could have affected the carbon inflow, however
the values of dissolved carbon recorded weekly during the
sampling period, by the Thames Water Authority, remained
steady around 240yxg C 1 (Fig. 4,3), Cladophora grew
unevenly over the bed, such that cores A, C, E, F, G and
H were covered with a dense algal skin, while cores B, D,
I and J had very little algal growth on the sand surface.
The numbers of ciliates counted in the ten cores
are recorded in Appendix 4,1, Means and variances were
calculated for each core (n = 3) and for each sampling
day (n » 6). These statistics were calculated for the
whole ciliate population and individually for the seven
species which were numerically dominant:- Cyclidium
heptatrichum. Cinetochilum margaritaceum, Litonotus sp,,
Oxytricha sp,, Tachysoma pellionella. Aspidisca costata.
and Vorticella convallaria (Table 4,3).

In most cases s > —x indicating a clumped or
contagious distribution. It was necessary to normalise
the data in order to compare the core populations using
analysis of variance and the transformations used to do
this were calculated using Taylor's Power Law (Elliott,
2
1977), The regression lines of Ins on In—x were calculated
for the whole ciliate population and the individual species
in each core (core «I was omitted from the calculations).
Each count (x) was then replaced by XP where P = 1 -
and b is the slope of the regression line (Table 4,4).

Fig. 4.4, indicates that the ciliate population as a whole was
distributed in a close to random pattern (b = 1.02, P =
0.05) while the individual species were more clumped in
distribution, Aspidisca sp.the least (b = 1.33, p = 0.01) and
Oxytricha spp. the most clumped (b = 1.95, p = 0.001).
Species giving significant regressions were tested
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for differences between
and within dates, and between and within cores. The
ANOVA tables which are presented fully in Appendix 4.2, are

* A low p value (p^O.05) indicates that the probability
of the differences in counts between samples being due
to random effects is low and hence the samples clearly
represent different populations.
Since the cores were collected on five different
dates, the first analysis examined the differences between
and within dates for the ciliates in total, both of which
proved to be significant (Appendix 4.2.1). However, core
J had unusually low ciliate densities (Appendix 4.1) so all
the data for this date were omitted from further analyses
(Appendix 4.2.2). The ciliates as a whole and the
individual species of Cyclidium, Oxytricha, Aspidisca and
Vorticella were then examined for differences between
and within dates over the first four sampling days.
Within dates there was no significant variability but
Cvclidium sp., Oxytricha s;p. and Vorticella sp. showed
significant differences in population size between dates
while the total ciliates and _Aspidisca,_s^. showed no
significant differences (p = 0.25 and p = 0.75 respectively).
Of the three species showing non-random variability,
Vorticella sp. increased significantly at a rate of

75
10.3% d 1 (p = 0,05) over the whole test period, and
Oxytricha sp. showed a similar trend (14,2% d"^, p = 0.05)
over the last three sampling days (Fig, 4.5). Cyclidium sp,
decreased in number over the test period at a rate of 3.2%
d (p = 0.1), but the probability value is just too high
for this decrease to be accepted as significant.
The rate of increase for Vorticella convallaria
lies between the values recorded for this species
during 2 runs performed at 12°C of 8.8% d~^ and 13.2% d”^
suggesting that the increase recorded is merely reflecting
the general change in population numbers of the filter bed.
The second analysis examined the differences in total
ciliate counts between and within cores using cores A to H,
each with three replicates. This showed random variability
within cores, but significant differences between cores
(Appendix 4,2.3). Core A, which yielded higher densities
of ciliates than the rest was omitted from the final analyses
which examined differences between and within cores of the
individual ciliate species in addition to the total ciliate
count (Appendix 4.2.4). Random variability was apparent
between cores in all the analyses (Table 4.5) and for all
except Cvclidium sp. and Vorticella sp. within cores;
these two species showed significant differences between
replicate sub-samples within the core samples (p = 0.001).
Vorticella sp. tends to grow gre^arioaslvj possibly explaining
the observed uneven distribution within cores, sp.
however, is a small free—swimming ciliate and its lack of
random variability within cores is difficult to account for.
The lack of replicability between sub-samples suggests that
the sampling technique used was not suitable for accurately
monitoring the distribution of these two species.

The concentration of particulate organic carbon
detected in the ten cores is recorded in Appendix 4,3.
Means and variances were calculated for each core (n = 3)
and for each sampling day (n = 6), and these data are
presented in Table 4,6,
In all cases with the exception of core A, X,
indicating a contagious distribution. In order to compare
the samples using ANOVA, it was necessary to normalise the
data and for this a In transformation was used. The
transformed data are recorded in Appendix 4,4, Means and
variances were calculated for the transformed data (Table 4,7)
2
and in all cases S z. —X",
Independence of the variances and the means was
tested both for the days (df = 1,3) and for the cores (df =
2
1,8) by attempting a regression plot of S v X—, In both
cases the regression lines calculated were insignificant,
p = 0,25 for the cores and p = 0,75 for the days. Also the
sums of squares for the In-transformed data were additive,
hence the In-transformed carbon data was normally distributed
and could be used in analyses of variance to examine within
and between date and core carbon content variations. The
analyses, recorded in Appendix 4,5 and summarised in Table
4,8, show that there was possibly significant variability
between the sampling days (5 dates with 6 replicates) and
between the cores (10 cores with 3 replicates). However,
both within cores and within dates the sub-samples showed
no significant differences in their particulate organic
carbon content.

There is no good justification for omitting core A
from the analyses of differences in counts between and
within cores, except for the fact that using cores B to H
one can say that, with the two exceptions already mentioned,
there is random variability within and between cores and
hence one sub-sample removed from one core is representative
of the sand at that depth in the cores within the filter
bed on the day of sampling. However, once core A is
included in the calculations this no longer remains true.
Until a better sampling system is designed which
permits the necessary replication, while avoiding the
impossible counting load presented by these small ciliates,
the errors inherent with the current system will remain,
and should be appreciated when interpreting the counts
from the regular monitoring of the filter beds.
4,7 Examination of bacteria
Three different techniques were used to examine the
depth distribution of bacteria associated with sand grains
in the top 30 on of a slow sand filter bed; these were:
direct examination of the sand grains by epifluorescence
microscopy, direct examination by scanning electron
microscopy and removal of bacteria from the grains, by

79
shaking with sterile water, prior to enumeration by epi-
fluorescence microscopy. The latter was found to be the
most practical method for repeated sampling and analysis
and was, therefore, adopted to examine changes in bacterial
density within the filter bed during the first ten days of
a filtration run.
Direct examination of sand grains by epifluorescence microscopy
Grains of sand from 1 cm, 2cm and 4 cm depths of a
28 day old core were examined within 2 hours of sampling.
Prior to analysis the Scimples were stored as described
previously (Section 4,4,5) to prevent dessication, as this
could cause the bacteria to slough off the grains. The
grains were stained in filter and heat sterile^, acridine
orange (10 mg/1) for 5 minutes and then washed in three
consecutive aliquots of sterile water. They were trans­
ferred onto a microscope slide and viewed under an 100 X
fluorescence water immersion objective (N,A, 1,20) with an
overall magnification of 800 X, under incident ultra-violet
light. The details of the microscopy are described later
(Section 4,7,2). The acridine orange, which is taken up
by bacteria into the DNA of the cell, absorbs blue light
and emits light of a lower energy (longer wavelength),
which is seen as fluorescent green. Care was required when
changing the field of view in order to avoid damaging the
objective on the uneven surface of the grain. Thirty
fields of view were counted per grain and three grains were

examined at each depth. The surface area of each grain
was estimated by measuring the side of greatest area using
a micrometer eyepiece- under low magnification. The surface
area measured was approximated to one or more geometrical
shapes, the area calculated and then multiplied by two.
Each sand grain was weighed so that the bacterial count
could be expressed in terms of bacteria per unit surface
area or bacteria per unit weight of sand.
The two main disadvantages of this technique were
firstly that the bacteria were very unevenly distributed,
tending to be localised in hollows and cracks as was also
found by Meadows and Anderson (1966) and secondly, only
the areas of the grain which were fairly free from * slime*
could be counted. Where the bacteria were embedded in
this material, an overall fluorescent glow was seen which
made counting individual bacteria an almost impossible task,
of
Because^these disadvantages, and the danger of scratching the
objective while examining sand grains, this method was not
adopted.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Sand grains from depths down to 25 cm in a 28 day
old core were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in a O.IM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) within 1} hours of sampling. They were
fj^xed overnight at 4^C, washed in O.IM phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) and finally dehydrated through a series of different
concentrations of acetone from 30% up to 100% (C. Spurdon,
Botany Dept. R.H.C., pers. comm) at which stage they were
stored until microscope time became available. Before
examination, the samples were critical-point-dried in carbon
dioxide using a Polaron Critical Point Drier. There is a
critical temperature at which a liquid and its vapour have
the same specific gravity and will thefore mix with each other

81
This property allows a liquid to be removed from the sample
without a phase boundary passing through it, as that would
disrupt fine structures (Cross, et al, 1977) and probably
cause the bacteria to come off the sand grains. The sand
samples in acetone were placed in the drying chamber and
immersed in liquid carbon dioxide. The chamber was slowly
heated to just above its critical temperature of 31.5°C at
which its critical pressure is about 1,200 lb per square
inch. The liquid disappeared and as soon as only carbon
dioxide vapour was present in the chamber, the pressure was
lowered to atmospheric pressure, while maintaining the
temperature at 32^C. The samples were placed on adhesive
coated stubs, sputter-coated with gold, using a Polaron
E5100 Series 2 Cool Sputter Coater, to a thickness of
75-100 % and viewed with a Cambridge S4/10 scanning electron
microscope at an accelerating voltage of 30 KV.
4.7.1 Removal of bacteria from sand grains
Sand grains were found to be too course for
a homogeniser, which has been used to effect removal of
bacteria from sediments (Hobbie, pers. comm.). Shying
sand samples with water is of limited value in removing
bacteria from the grains, as they seem to cling on with
great tenacity (Pearse, et al, 1942). However, by
accepting these limitations and standardising the shaking
procedure to give comparable results, this technique has
been used successfully (Pearse et al, 1942; Anderson and
Meadows, 1969; Metropolitan Water Board Report No. 43,
1967/68). To improve the efficiency of bacterial removal,
Babiuk and Paul (1970) and Iliermans and Schmidt (1975)

82
added various dispersal agents, e.g. 1% sodium meta­
phosphate, but these were found to be slightly toxic to
certain bacteria even at low concentrations (Babiuk and
Paul, 1970).
To remove bacteria from the filter bed sand, a 1 cm^
subsample was shaken with 10 cm^ of sterile distilled
water for thirty minutes on a Gallenkamp flask shaker.
The supernatant was used for bacterial enumeration. The
efficiency of this shaking procedure was tested by removing
some of the grains after they had been shaken and staining
and viewing them as described earlier (p. 79). The
supernatant was also stained and counted and the numbers in
both cases were manipulated to estimate the total count of
bacteria present in 1 cm of sand. (p. 80 and 84).
Approximately one third of the bacteria associated with
the grain surface was found to be removed by shaking.
However, as the procedure was strictly standardised it was
assumed that all results were comparable, and that
population changes measured in this way were accurate
estimates.
4.7.2 Enumeration of bacteria in suspension
Spread plates and the plate dilution frequency
technique of Harris and Sommers (1968) were tested using
Collins CPS agar (Collins and Willoughby, 1962), and direct
counts were also made in a Neubauer chamber, using the
same bacterial suspension of stagnant pond water for
all three techniques. The counts obtained by these three
methods were vastly different ranging from 10® ml" to
10^® ml"^ and the variation within each method was

83 -,
unacceptably high. Direct examination using acridine
orange epifluorescence was found to be more reliable and
the means of replicate counts did not differ significantly
(p ^ 0,05, Table 4,9) so a procedure based on that described
by Jones and Simon (1975) was used.
After the sand sample had been shaken for 30
minutes with sterile water, a ten-fold series dilution
was prepared from the supernatant down to 10“®. The
dilution, found by trial and error to give no more than 30
counts per field was counted, this was generally the 10“^
—2
or 10 dilution. 1 ml of sterile acridine orange
(100 mg 1 ^) was added to the bacterial suspension, giving
a final concentration of 10 mg l“^ acridine orange. The
tube was inverted once to mix the stain and suspension
and left to stand for six minutes. During this time a
Millipore 0 . 2 2 membrane filter which had been dyed black
with Dylon No. 8 Ebony Black (Jones and Simon, 1975) was
placed in a sterile Millipore filter holder, and covered
with about 5 cm® of pre-filtered, sterile, diluent water.
This soaked the membrane and facilitated even filtering of
the bacterial suspension over the whole area of the membrane
filter. After the six minute staining period, the
suspension was filtered through the membrane filter and
the retained bacteria and detritus washed with a further
20 cm® of sterile water. As the last of the water passed
through the membrane it was transferred onto a drop of
immersion oil on a microscope slide, immediately covered
with more oil and viewed under incident ultra violet light.
Thirty fields were counted per membrane, this was found to
be the optimum number. When fewer fields were counted

84
there was a tendency to overestimate the numbers present ,
but no further accuracy was gained by counting more than
thirty fields, A random choice of field was ensured by
moving stepwise across the membrane using the mechanical
stage and counting the number of bacteria present in the
field of view after each pair of movements on the
horizontal and vertical scales. Using a micrometer eye
piece, the surface area of the field of view was calculated
to be 4.16 X 10®jLL^. The filtering area of the membrane
8 2
filter was 2.01 X 10 jx , so the number of bacteria present
3
over the whole filter, i.e. shaken from 1 cm of sand was
estimated by:

Microscopy
Counts were made on a Leitz Orthoplan microscope
fitted with a 50-W ultra high pressure mercury lamp and a
Pleomopak 2 fluorescence vertical illuminator.
Excitation was through a 2 mm KGl heat absorption filter,
a 4 mm BG 38 red suppression filter, a K490 nm suppression
filter and the dichroic mirror/suppression filter
combination TK 510/K515. The image was viewed through
a K510 nm suppression filter in the filter slide (Fig. 4.6)
Bacteria were counted through an NPl lOOX oil
immersion objective (N.A. 1.32) at a total magnification
of 800 X. The mean exciting wavelength of acridine orange
is 470 nm and its fluorescence maxima lie between 530 and
650 nm. Figure 4.7 shows the effect of the filter
combination used to suppress the exciting radiation and
transmit the fluorescent radiation only.

Tests on the sterile technique, conducted using a

suggested that a 0,2% error was introduced to the counts
by the sterile water used as diluent, pre-filter diluent

4. 8 Organic carbon determination
Organic matter present in a slow sand filter
consists of live microfauna, meiofauna and algae in addition
to the decaying organic matter of both autocthonous and
allocthonous origin. Consequently an overall measure of
organic carbon does not give an accurate value of food
availability for any particular organism but it does give
an indication of food conditions, is easily determined and
gives information which can be compared with other environ­
ments in addition to being used to examine seasonal and
other time-related changes of food availability within the
slow sand filter environment.
The method used to determine particulate organic
carbon (P.O.C.) was one of wet dichromate oxidation followed
by a potentiometric end point detection in a titration to
determine the volume of potassium dichromate remaining
after the oxidation process. This has been described in
detail by Lodge (1979) and is summarised below.
4.8.1 Experimental procedure
The subsamples of sand used for carbon
determination had been stored in capped vials after drying
at 80^C for 24 hours on the day of sampling (Section 4.4.5).
Analysis of 90 subsamples took two days, the first occupied
by the oxidation procedure and the second by titrations.

Five mis of distilled water were added to a 1 cm
sand sample and this was shaken for two hours. One ml
of the supernatant was removed into a pyrex glass reaction
vessel and to this one ml of 0.2N dichromate and four mis
of concentrated sulphuric acid were added. The vessel was

89
swirled to mix the fluids and placed in an 120^C oven for
three hours, and then allowed to cool. The reactants were
diluted with twenty mis of distilled water, so that the
platinum/calomel electrode used to detect the titration end
point, could be immersed sufficiently, and titrated
against a 2% acidic solution of O.lN ferrous ammonium
sulphate with continuous mixing by a magnetic stirer.
The end point was determined potentiometrically,
The potential difference between a platinum
indicator and a combined calomel reference electrode, with
a resistance of 200 Kil across it which reduced the voltage
to a value detectable on the millivolt scale of a pH meter,
was used to follow the titration. The platinum electrode
was polarised by an applied potential of +1 volt, produced
by a Nife cell in conjunction with a potentiometer, and
the resulting low potential difference between indicator
and reference electrode was corrected to zero on the mv
scale of the pH meter by using the variable zero control
(Fig. 4.8). A Metrohm EA234 combined platinum/calomel
reference electrode was used and the potential difference
measured by a Pye Dynacap pH meter.
The ferrous ammonium sulphate (FAS) titrant was
added from a Metrohm E457 piston burette, which had a
capacity of five ml. The normality of the FAS was chosen
as O.lN so that the volume of titrant used per titration
was between one and two mis, FAS was added until all
excess dichromate had been reduced and excess ferrous ions
were present in solution. These caused the platinum
electrode to become negatively charged, registering a
potential difference on the mV scale:

A reading was taken immediately after the end point
and four further readings were taken after successive
additions of aliquots of FAS. The increase in
potential registered was directly proportional to the
volume of FAS added and so by extrapolation through these
points back to zero mV, the end point value of FAS could
be obtained (Fig, 4.9), Blanks to determine the carbon
content of the distilled water used and controls to
determine the normality of the FAS were also titrated.
4.8.2 Calculation of carbon content
After subtracting the average titrant value
for three blanks from a sample titrant value, the resulting
volume of FAS was equivalent to the volume of dichromate
used in the carbon oxidation. From this value the carbon
3
present in the 1 cm sand subsample could be calculated:
Let Vb = Volume of FAS used to reach Blank end point ^1)
Vs = Volume of FAS used to reach Sample end point ^1)
Np = Normality of FAS
Vw = Volume of water shaken with sample in vial (ml)
Va = Volume of aliquot of suspended organic matter
removed for reaction (ml).
The equivalent weight of an oxidising agent is that
weight of the reagent which reacts with or contains 8.0 g
of available oxygen (Vogel, 1955).

4.9 Statistical analyses
4*9*1 Normal distribution parameters
Means quoted are arithmetic, 95% confidence
limits of the means were calculated as:
95% confidence limits = mean + 6 SE
where S,E, = Standard Error of the mean.
When the data did not fulfill the requirements of
a normal distribution, it was necessary to transform it.
Any such transformations are described where used in the
text,
4,9.2 Numerical integration
Numerical integration was employed to estimate
total population densities of organisms in a core of sand
2
with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm , when only samples from
eight depths, spaced down the core, had been examined,
A Hewlett Packard Program Tape was used which accepted
X(depth) and y (numerical abundance) data and calculated
the area under the smoothest curve which could be described
by the series of points entered in to the programme.
The integral obtained was then divided by the lowest
depth examined to give an estimated average population
density. Although this was not an accurate estimate for
any given depth, as densities were always much higher at
the surface of the sand,- it did allow for comparisons
between cores and between different filtration runs, as

95
during the earlier runs the lowest depth examined varied.
Once a procedure had been established the lowest depth
examined was 25 cm.
4.9.3 Linear regressions
Linear regression analyses were used to define
the relationship between population density and time. The
population density of the organisms was found to increase
exponentially with time; described by the regression
formula:
^ o
by taking the natural logarithms of both sides of
the equation it becomes:
InN^ = InNo + rt
Hence a regression plot of In population density (N)
against time (6) had a slope r which represented the
instantaneous rate of numerical increase. The significance
of the slope was determined by comparing the variance ratio
of the regression equation at the required degrees of free­
dom with those tabulated in Rohlf and Sokal (1969).
4.9.4 Analysis of variance
Analysis of variance tests were used to compare
the variation in a set of data which had been partitioned
into components associated with the possible sources of
variation. Two-way analysis of variance was used to
compare matched groups of data and to determine whether
variation was significant between and/or within these groups
of data. Details of thé calculations are given in Sokal
and Rohlf (1969),

Chapter 5 Environmental Parameters
Certain physical and chemical parameters of the
filter bed were monitored by the Metropolitan Water
Division of the Thames Water Authority; these included
head loss, flow rate and dissolved oxygen, which were
recorded continuously, and particulate organic carbon
content of the surface and filtrate waters, which were
determined weekly. In addition to these, each sample
core removed from the filter beds during the study, was
analysed for particulateorganic carbon content throughout
its depth. Grain size and porosity of the filter bed
sand in sampling cores were also determined. The surface
water temperature was recorded on each sampling occasion
and these temperature data are listed with the sampling
programme in Appendix 5.1.
5.1 Head loss
During each filter bed run the head loss, or
difference in head between raw and filtered water
(described on Page ZL) increased rapidly over the first few
days (Fig. 5.1) resulting from the rise in filtration rate
to the target value of 16” h ^ (0.4m h ) on bed 45 and
8” h”^ (0.2m h"^) on bed 44 (Appendix 5.2). Following
this initial sharp rise, the head loss usually continued
to increase more gradually until the end of the run.
However, during run 3, a second sharp rise occurred after
interval of two weeks. Observing the increase in head
loss alone did not take into account the changing flow
rate, which was gradually increased to the target value
and maintained at this rate until the resistance of the

bed increased to a value above which further head loss
gain was accompanied by a decrease in filtration rate.
The head loss data was corrected to the target filtration
rate as follows:
Ht = ^ X Vt in.
Where Ht = head loss at target filtration rate (in.)
Hf = head loss at actual filtration rate (in.)
Vt = target filtration rate (in.h“^)
Vf = actual filtration rate (in.h“^)
The increase of the corrected head loss with time
(Appendix 5,3) was gradual over the first week or two of a
run, but suddenly changed to a much more rapid increase
after this period (Fig. 5.2). Variations from this
characteristic pattern did occur; a rapid increase in
head loss occurred throughout run 1, a very short run
following the resanding of bed 45 in March 1976.
During runs 4 and 5, the two summer runs, the low rate
of gain in head loss was continuous throughout the
length of the r uns; a possible explanation of
this is given later (p.100). During run 7, a very cold
winter run with an average temperature of 4°C, the increase
in head loss was again fairly constant throughout the run, apart
from a drop in head loss during the fifth week. Head loss
per unit flow increased constantly in bed 44 over the whole
run, while at the same time in bed 45, with twice the flow
rate, the rate of head loss gain doubled after 22 days.
Particulate organic carbon was determined in the
30 cm cores removed from the filter bed on each sampling
occasion (Appendix 5.4). The carbon content of the top

1 cm of sand is shown in Figure 5.3. During every run
on bed 45, between day 10 and 15, a sudden accumulation
of surface carbon occurred giving at least a 10-fold
increase over that period. In bed 44 the increase was of
a lower magnitude (about 3-fold) and occurred over fifteen
days between days 10 and 25.
During runs 3 and 8, the two spring runs, this
rapid carbon increase coincided with the change
loss gain and in run 6, the change in head loss immediately
followed the carbon increase. However, the rapid carbon
accumulation during the 4°C winter run (run 7) had no
apparent effect on the increase of head loss, and
similarly during the two summer runs (runs 4 and 5) ther apid
carbon increase did not effect the constant rate of gain in
head loss. This constant rate of gain in head loss
observed over the summer runs may have been due to the
formation of a 'Schmutzdecke* over the filter skin.
This reduces the suspended matter reaching the filter
proper, provided that compaction of the Schmutzdecke does
not occur onto the filter bed surface (Huisman, 1970).
In run 5, the dissolved oxygen of the top water correspond­
ingly increased from 5 mg 1 ^ to 12 mg 1 over this
period of the run from day 18 to 26 indicating higher
primary productivity above the filter surface (Fig. 5.4a)
which would concur with the presence of & Schmutzdecke.
5.2 Dissolved Oxygen
Limited data are available from the continuous
monitoring of dissolved oxygen, as the recording unit was
first introduced in July 1976 and was then run on an

experimental basis only for the first few months (Personal
communication, Thames Water Authority), However, general
trends in the dissolved oxygen contents of the top water
and filtrate of bed 45 can be seen in the data plotted
in Figs, 5,4 a and b for runs 5 and 8 respectively.
The dissolved oxygen in the top water remained steady,
fluctuating daily by only 1 or 2 mg
At the end of the summer run (run 5) it increased,
presumably due to increased photosynthesis by such plants
as Cladophora which densely colonised the bed at this time.
The dissolved oxygen of the filtrate exhibited large diurnal
fluctuations throughout both runs. The daily peaks in
the filtrate increased over the first 7 to.10 days,
presumably due to oxygen production by the growing algal
population with little demand from animal respiration;
after about two weeks, these maxima declined and
correspondingly the minima also decreased. The animal
fourva developed strongly after about 10 days (Chapter 9)
and their respiratory oxygen demand would probably account
for these decreases, in addition to bacterial decomposer
activity. In the summer months (Fig, 5,4a) these minima
approached zero mg 1 ^, while at other times of the year
they rarely fell below 5mg 1 , In the summer the filter
skin would have been shaded by the Schmutzdecke above it in
the latter week of the run. Photosynthesis at the filter
surface was apparently then reduced, as the filtrate oxygen
never rose above 5 mg 1 ^ while the top water oxygen rose
steadily from 6 to 12 mg 1 •

5• 3 Particulate organic carbon
(a) Top Water and Filtrate
The particulate organic carbon (P.O.C.) content of
the top water and filtrate, monitored by the Thames Water
Authority, is represented in Fig, 5,5 (data in Appendix 5.5),
The area between the two graphs represents the removal of
PpOoC, by the filter bed. The removal efficiency
apparently increased at the higher summer temperatures and
also with time during the filter bed runs. This would
correspond with increased biological activity both with
temperature and with maturity of the bed during each run.
Because of this variation in activity, despite the four­
fold difference between summer and winter P.O.C. content of
the top water, the filtrate levels remained similar
throughout the year.
(b) Sand Cores
3
The particulate organic carbon content per cm of
sand in the sand cores was determined on each sampling
occasion as described in section 4,8, The results of
these analyses are tabulated in Appendix 5,4, Carbon
accumulated mainly at the surface of the sand (Fig. 5,6)
its concentration decreasing with depth to 10 cm below the
surface and remaining fairly constant at depths below this
to 25 cm. The data was In-transformed to convert this
exponential curve to a linear slope in order to assess the
change in gradient with the age of a filtration run.
Linear regressions of In carbon content against depth
were calculated (Appendix 5,6) and those giving
significant gradients (p ^0,05) are summarised below in
Table 5,1,

An exponential gradient of carbon content does
not seem to occur through the top 25 cm of sand until a
certain length of time has elapsed, this being shorter in
the summer runs (about 10 days) and longer in the winter
(20 - 30 days). The positive gradients, showing an
increase in P.O.C. content with depth during the first
half of run 4 are difficult to account for, and do not
appear to be related to any operational or biological
properties of the filter bed at this time.
Figure 5.7 demonstrates that the gradient of the
slope of the P.O.C. content against depth regression
increased in magnitude (i.e. became more negative) with
the age of a filtration run, regardless of the season
(p = 0.005). The regression is summarised in Table 5.2,
Bed 44 data were omitted from the calculation as the
filtration rate effected the depth of penetration.

all the depth values (mg C cm from 1 cm to 25 cm where
recorded, and integrating the values obtained between 1
and 25 cm where not all depths were analysed (Appendix 5.7).
These values were plotted against time for each run (Fig.
5.8). During most runs (3, 4, 6 and 8) a rapid increase
in particulate organic carbon per cm^ over the first two
weeks was followed by a plateau, with no further change
in carbon concentration. During runs 5, 7 and the run
on Bed 44 the increase in carbon content was more or
less constant throughout the time periods examined.
The low temperature of run 7 (4°C) and the slow flow rate
of the Bed 44 run were probably the main contributory
factors causing low accumulation of organic carbon.
The low and constant rate of increase in carbon
concentration during run 5 may have been caused by the
primary screening effect of the Schmutzdecke overlying
the filter bed surface.
As most of the carbon accumulation occurred in
the top 10 cm of sand (Fig. 5.6) the data were divided
into two parts : 2 to 10 cm and 11 to 25 cm. Regressions
were then calculated of the carbon content against age
of the filtration runs for each run (Appendix 5.8).
The top cm. was not included in these calculations as it
had a far greater content of carbon than the lower depths
due to its associated algal growths and has consequently

been considered separately, earlier in this chapter (5.1)
The regression plots (Fig, 5,9) confirm that accumulation
occurred mainly in the top 10 cm of sand throughout the run
duration in runs 3, 6, 7 and 8, but only up to day 13 in
run 4 and day 11 in run 5, Some accumulation occurred
at the lower depths during the first half of the spring
and summer runs (runs 3 and 5) and throughout the winter
run (run 7). No pattern of accumulation was detectable
in the lower depths during runs 4 and 6 nor in either of
the depth levels of the bed 44 run,
5.4 Grain size and porosity of the filter bed sand.
Grain Size
The grain size of the sand was determined at seven
depths in 3 replicate cores extracted from bed 45 in
November 1976, These cores had been filled with sand
from the sand bay at Hampton Treatment Works, in which
sand was stored before being put on to the filter bed.
The three cores were left in the bed for 25 days of a
filtration run before they were removed. Samples of
about 40 cm^ were taken at depths of 1 cm, 2 cm, 5 cm,
9 cm, 13 cm, 19 cm and 25 cm down the cores. These
samples were passed through a nest of sieves with pore
diameters of 4,0 mm, 2,0 mm, 850yini, 500yx.m, 250yiim,
125yUm and 63yum, by shaking in a mechanical shaker for
30 minutes. The different grades of sand were weighed
for each sample and the results are tabulated in

Porosity
The porosity was calculated using the following
equation:-
% pore space = 100 - apparent specific gravity X 100
real specific gravity 1
The apparent specific gravity of the sand is its
specific gravity including trapped air whereas the real
specific gravity is the specific gravity of the sand
particles alone.
Determination of real specific gravity
A specific gravity bottle full of distilled water
was weighed at room temperature. (= a gm). Half the
water was poured out and air dried sand was added to the
bottle which was then reweighed (= b gm). The mixture
was boiled gently to release the trapped air, cooled to
room temperature and the bottle filled with distilled

120
water before reweighing (= c gm). The increase in weight
(c-a) was due to the difference between b gm of send and
the weight of an equal quantity of water. Therefore,
the specific gravity of the sandL particles was equal to:
b — (c—a)
a = 22.12366 g
b = 5.49704 g
c = 25.57219 g
.. real specific gravity = 2.68343
Determination of the apparent specific gravity
A tube was weighed and filled to a pre-determined
mark firstly with air dried sand and secondly with water.
The apparent specific gravity is equal to:-
a.s.g, = weight of sand
weight of same volume of water
Values obtained for a.s.g, = 1,71874 g

Chapter 6 Interstitial Ciliate Species Recorded in
the Slow Sand Filter Beds
The system of classification adopted for the
ciliates isolated from the sand samples removed from the
filter beds, is that described by Corliss (1977). This
scheme supersedes those of Kahl (1930 - 1935) and Faure-
Fremiet (1950) due to increased knowledge of ultra-structure
brought about mainly by studies using the electron
microscope. Table 6.1 lists the ciliates and their size
ranges, and the more common species are shown in plates
6,1 to 6,10, The ciliates were generally identified to
genus level although the dominant ones were identified to
species level. Identification was aided by Kahl (1930 -
1935), Bick (1972), Curds (1970) and Kudo (1971).
Amoebae, flagellates and helizoa were not identified but
their size ranges are included in Table 6,1,
Most of the ciliates extracted from the filter bed
sand were at the lower end of the size range reported in
Kahl (1930 - 1935), It appears that rotifers removed
from filter bed sand were also found to be smaller in
general than those found elsewhere (R, Pontin, personal
communication) and the recorded lengths of ciliates living
in the periphyton of a freshwater stream (Pâtsch, 1974)
were similar to those of the present study. The effects
which temperature, the rate of replication and the flow
rate of water through the filter beds had on individual
ciliate size are discussed in Chapter 8,

Chapter 7 The Vertical Distribution of Ciliates and
Flagellates in Filter Bed Sand
Introduction
The depth distributions of the ciliates and
flagellates were examined regularly during each
filtration run (Appendix 5.1) by determining their
3
densities per cm sand as described earlier (p. 60)
at eight depths between the sand surface and a depth of
25 cm. This data permitted the variations of species
diversity, population density and cell volume of the
ciliates, with depth and time during a run, to be
analysed. Vertical and temporal variations in
flagellate densities were examined and seasonal differences
in the population densities of both ciliates and
flagellates were studied. In addition, relationships
between environmental variables, such as the filtration
rate and particulate organic carbon concentration, and
the population densities were assessed.
7.1 Species diversity
The variation of species diversity with depth in
the top 25 cm of sand was examined in bed 45 during runs
3 to 8 only, as prior to this only depths down to 10 cm
had been analysed. Figure 7.1 shows the change in
3
numbers of ciliate species per cm with depth and time
during these runs (data are given in Appendix 7.1).
The source of ciliates present in the sand cores
after just a few hours of filtration is of considerable
importance, as their presence would greatly influence

certainly the initial development of ciliate populations
within the cores. A disadvantage of the sampling technique
adopted was that no horizontal movement between the core
and filter bed sand could occur. This may have been a
major direction of travel within the filter bed itself
although the dominant pressure would naturally have been
in a downward direction. The ciliates, and flagellates
were,however, able to enter the sand cores by any of the
following routes:-
1. With the sand from the washing bay
(a) as cysts in dry sand
(b) as active cells and cysts in damp sand.
2. Carried in with the input water.
3. Washed in from the surrounding sand surface.
4. Migration upwards with the flow during back-
charging.
5. Migration downwards in the direction of flow,
6. Migration upwards against the direction of flow.
The diagramatic representation in Figure 7.2
demonstrates three temporal phases in the depth
distributions of ciliate species numbers in the cores,
obtained from the data presented in Figure 7.1, The
days on which these phases began in each run are shown
in Table 7.1.

The first phase, recorded only in runs 3, 5 and 8
when sampling was carried out on day 1, showed either a
fairly uniform distribution of ciliate species numbers
with depth, as in run 8, or a peak number of species
in the surface sand with lower numbers at depths
below (runs 3 and 5). The second phase was characterized
by a large number of species at the surface, probably
introduced via routes 2 and/or 3, and an exponential
decrease with depth, while the third phase demonstrated
surface avoidance, with the greatest number of species
present just below the surface.
Data used to examine the replicability of the
sampling programme (Section 4.6) were analysed for
replicability of the numbers of species present in the
cores at a depth of 10 cm. No significant difference
was found in the number of species present in replicates
within cores (p = 0.75) and although greater variability
was found in replicates between the cores (p = 0.05),
this was not very significant. (Data from 8 cores,
each with three replicates were analysed).
Phase 1
Initial colonisation in runs 3 and 5 followed the
distribution shown in Figure 7,2b, while that of run 8
was similar to Figure 7.2a. The species present on the
first day of these three runs are given in Table 7.2 with
their individual depth distributions.

from below
In Phase 1 or run 5, many of the ciliate species
present as active cells in the core, were either at or
just below the sand surface. It would appear that these
had colonised from either the water above the sand or the
filter bed sand surrounding the core.
The Species were distributed ubiquitously
re m a in in g
throughout the depth of the core, suggesting that they

137
were probably present as cysts in the sand before it was
used to fill the cores.
The encysted form is a common occurrence providing
protection against unfavourable conditions, e.g. drought or
food deficiency. Not all species are able to form drought-
resistant cysts, although some, e,g. Oxytricha spp cysts
have been reported to survive four years of drought
(Dawson and Mitchell, 1929). The sand used to fill the
cores had been washed and drained but was always still
moist. It is probable that the strength of the cyst wall
was more important than its ability to withstand drought,
as the mechanical agitation of the sand during the washing
process and subsequent handling would be highly abrasive
to any protozoa present.
Most ciliate species present in the first dayfe
sampling of run 8 had probably been present as cysts in
the washed sand, three species had possibly colonised
from the surface and two species appeared to have
migrated vertically upwards from the sand below the core.
This migration of Euplotes sp and Chilodonella sp may
have occurred with the back-charging of the bed before
it was put back into operation.
No pattern was observed as to which species were
present as cysts in the sand used to fill the cores at
the beginning of a run, nor as to which species
colonised the sand from above or below. The individual
depth distributions of the common ciliate species are
given for each run in Appendix 7.2.

138
Phase 2
The second type of distribution shows a diverse
ciliate fauna present in the surface sand, with this
diversity decreasing exponentially with depth. The
phase occurred between days 5 and 10 in all runs except
for run 4, in which it had occurred by day 3 (Table 7.1).
The depths at which the individual common ciliate species
were recorded during this second phase of colonisation are
shown in Table 7.4.
Certain of the initial surface colonisers in
Phase 1 appeared to have spread down into the sand while
additional species also colonised, mainly in the surface
layers. For example, during run 8, Glaucoma sp and
Trachelophyllum sp descended further into the sand between
days 1 and 9, while additional species such as Loxophyllum
sp. Halteria sp. Lacrymaria olor. Vorticella campanula and
Opercularia sp had also colonised the surface layers.
By day 6 of run 5, C. margaritaceum. Pleuronema sp
and T. pellionella had spread further down into the sand
since day 1, while additional surface colonisers included
Litonotus sp. Spathidium sp and V. campanula. In both
runs 5 and 8, V. convallaria had rapidly colonised the entire
25 cm depth in the few days between the first two samplings.
There still appeared to be some colonisation from below,
as L. olor was recorded for the first time during run 4 at
25 cm on day 3 (Appendix 7.2).
In order to migrate upwards the ciliate would have
to overcome or avoid the flow rate of water downward
through the interstices,which at a flow of 16” hr ^

139
(40 cm hr ) would be about 1.75 cm min""^ (see Appendix
7.3 for calculation of interstitial flow). For a
Lacrymaria olor of 300^m length this flow rate is equivalent
to 60 body lengths per minute. However, by keeping very
close to the sand grains the ciliate would avoid most of
this flow of water (Page 27)

The third type of distribution which demonstrated
surface avoidance by a large number of ciliate species
occurred on days 25 and 28 in runs 4 (25), 3 and 8 (28),
day 19 in run 7 and earlier, on days 11 and 12, in runs 5
and 6 respectively (Figure 7.1). The depth
distributions recorded for each species on the above
sampling days are summarised in Table 7.5 (detailed
account in Appendix 7.2).
The ciliate species which constantly avoided the
surface layers of sand, Lacrymaria olor, Trachelophyllum
sp., Litonotus sp. and Loxophyllum sp. are all carnivorous,
feeding on other ciliates (Sandon, 1932) as well as all
being well adapted to life in the sand interstices

withstand the surface conditions as well as living deeper
in the sand cores were either omnivorous (Stentor
polymorphus). bacteriovorous (Vorticella spp..
Glaucoma sp., C. margaritaceum. C. heptatrichum,
Pleuronema sp. and A. costata) or they consumed small
particles such as small algae, detritus and flagellates
(Stylonichia mytilus, Uroleptus sp., Oxytricha spp.,
Euplotes sp. and T. pellionella). The details of
ciliate nutrition were obtained from Bick (1972) and
Sandon (1932).
The obligate carnivores, which were also the larger
ciliate species present, appeared to have moved to the
sand depths below the region of maximum detrital
density, where they could possibly move around more
freely and where their prey density was still sufficiently
high.

7.2 Population Density
The density-depth distributions of eleven common
ciliate species are shown in Figures 7.3 to 7.13 (the
data are tabulated in Appendix 7.2) for the filtration
runs on bed 45. Figures 7.14 and 7.15 show the depth
distributions of the ciliates in total and the flagellates
respectively for the same runs,while Figures 7.16 and 7.17
illustrate the data obtained during the autumn 1976
filtration run on bed 44. (Note that the density scales
of figures 7.14 and 7.15 differ from those of the other
figures). When the ciliates were examined as a phylum
(Figure 7.14), the maximum density always occurred at or
just below the surface of the sand. This figure also
demonstrates how the ciliates increased in density up to
a certain day in each run, after which the population
declined as the run proceeded. These population increases
and decreases are examined in Chapter 8. In this section
the vertical distributions of the dominant ciliate species
are examined individually, with an attempt to explain why
species differed in their distributions and why each
species may have changed its depth of greatest density
during the course of a filter bed run, and varied
seasonally in its overall density.
Glaucoma sp. (Figure 7.3)
From the initial colonisation of the sand cores,
until the end of a run. Glaucoma sp. was generally most
abundant at the surface, decreasing to lower densities
from 2 to 4 cm downwards. Maximum densities of between
— 3
150 and 250 individuals cm" were present at the surface
—3
throughout the year with generally less than 10 cm

144
present below 5 cm.
Cyclidium heptatrichum (Figure 7.4)
Cyclidium heptatrichum generally avoided the sand
surface throughout all the filtration runs, with maximum
densities occurring just below it at 2 cm. During the
autumn, winter and spring runs of 1976/77 (Runs 6, 7 and
8), the surface avoidance peaks progressed deeper into
the filter bed as the runs proceeded. In run 6, the
October/November run of 1976, very high densities were
recorded; this may have been related to the quality of
organic matter passing into the bed at that time, which
would have been decaying green algae with its associated
bacteria on which C. heptatrichum, being bacteriovorous,
may feed. However, neither the carbon content of the
input water nor the particulate organic carbon density in
the sand were unusually high (Appendix 5.4 and 5.5).
Maximum densities varied from 25, in the cold winter run
(average temperature, 4^C) to 750 cm”^ at 12°C in run 6.
—3
Maximum densities were relatively low, 130 cm” , during
the summer runs (20^C and 19^C) suggesting that
C. heptatrichum has an optimum ambient temperature of
about 12°C.
Cinetochilum margaritaceum (Figure 7.5)
Cinetochilum margaritaceum occurred at maximum
densities normally either at or immediately below the
surface. The highest populations occurred at the highest
temperatures of runs 4 and 5 (20^ and 19° respectively)
where oxygen levels in the filtrate water ranged from
near zero to about 6 mg l”^ (Figure 5.4a). During the

145
rest of the year, at lower temperatures and higher
oxygen regimes, C. margaritaceum remained at much lower
o
_
densities (maximum of about 150 cm” ) relative to the
— 3
maxima of up to 920 cm” attained during run 5. This
seasonal variation corresponds well with the optimum
values of 15°C and 0 - 6 mg 1 ^ of temperature and dissolved
oxygen put forward by Bick and Kunze (1971) for this ciliate.
Chilodonella sp. (Figure 7.6)
Chilodonella sp. was generally only present in
significant densities in the latter half of a run and
during this time it was most common at the surface,
— 3
reaching high densities on only two occasions : 220 cm”
— 3
in run 7 and 260 cm in run 8, the late winter/spring
runs of 1977. The active cells did not always survive
to the end of the filter run, being absent at the ends of
both runs 4 and 7. The temperature and dissolved oxygen
(D.O.) content of the water were always well within its
tolerances : 0 - 30°C, 0 - 12 mg l”^ dissolved oxygen
(Bick, 1972), so some other factor such as competition,
predation or an insufficient food supply must have been
responsible for its seasonal variation in density.
Lacrymaria olor (Figure 7.7)
Lacrymaria olor was present in detectable numbers
generally as the smaller ciliates began to decline in
density and,whenever present it occurred in low densities
throughout the 25 cm core of sand. Maxima of about
o
_
20 cm” occurred between 2 and 4 cm from the sand surface.
The late colonisation of this species is possibly related
to its carnivorous mode of nutrition, feeding on smaller
ciliates.

146
Litonotus spp (Figure 7,8)
Litonotus spp. were also slow to reach detectable
densities in most runs; these species also being
carnivorous, feed on ciliates and flagellates. Surface
avoidance was generally apparent, with peak densities
occurring between 2 and 4 cm below the surface. However,
on the last day of run 5 Litonotus spp. were present in
_ o
particularly high numbers (130 cm” ) at the sand surface.
Higher temperatures favoured larger populations of
Litonotus spp. with the maximum density in the winter
(4°C) run of 25 cm ^ compared with that of run 5 abov<
(19°C) and the 20°C maximum (run 4) of 125 cm”^.
Tachysoma pellionella (Figure 7.9)
During most filtration runs, Tachysoma pellionella
increased in density fairly rapidly in the surface layers
with little growth in population occurring below 4 cm.
As the bed conditions became less favourable and the
population density declined, the vertical distribution
remained the same with higher densities occurring at the
surface. The highest population maxima were recorded in
—3
both the spring filtration runs studied : 985 cm in
run 3 (spring 1976) and 560 cm ^ in run 8 (spring 1977),
— 3
the other maxima ranged between 140 and 300 cm . These
high spring densities corresponded with the extremely high
densities (940 cm”^) found by Wilbert (1969) in the
periphyton of a eutrophic pond during March and April of
1966.
Aspidisca costata (Figure 7.10)
A. costata was found predominantly at the surface
throughout a filtration run. However, run 6 (October/

147
/November 1976) was a total exception, with
A, costata exhibiting surface avoidance throughout the
run with highest densities occurring between 4 and 25 cm
below the surface. Population maxima ranged over the
“3 — 3
year from 150 cm to 380 cm with no obvious seasonal
differences. Temperature and oxygen stati of the bed
were well within the tolerance limits of A. costata
throughout the year : 0 - 38°C and 0 - 22.4 mg 1”^ D.O.
(Bick and Kunze, 1971).
Oxytricha spp. (Figure 7.11)
Oxytricha spp. occurred in maximum numbers at the
sand surface during the first half of a run, moving away
from the surface by 2 to 4 cm as environmental conditions
presumably deteriorated for them with the exception of
run 8, where a surface peak remained on day 28. However,
throughout run 6, as with A. costata, they exhibited
surface avoidance, the population density peak descending
from 2 cm on day 12 to 7 cm by day 40. Maximum population
— 3 — 3
densities for each run varied from 40 cm” to 190 cm , the
higher numbers being present at temperatures below 12°C
during the runs from January to the end of April 1977.
Stentor polymorphus (Figure 7.12)
S. polymorphus was generally detected only in the
latter stages of a filtration run in the top 10 cm of sand.
It was only ever present in low densities (maxima ranging
from 5 to 80 cm”^) and occurred mainly during the spring
and early summer (runs 4 and 8). The water temperature
fell below 4°C, the minimum temperature tolerated by
S. polymorphus (Bick, 1972) during the early part of run

148
7 (Appendix 5.1), but had risen to 5-5°C by day 45,
the age of the bed when this ciliate was recorded.
Vorticella spp. (Figure 7.13)
The Vorticella spp.began to colonise the cores
after about 10 days. They were generally present in
highest densities at the surface, although some surface
avoidance occurred throughout the second halves of runs
3 (April to June, 1976) and 6 (October/November, 1976).
The two summer runs (4 and 5) produced the highest
— 3
densities of Vorticella spp. with as many as 494 cm”
at the surface; maxima during the year ranged from
85 cm ^ in spring 1977 (run 8) to 494 cm”^. Despite its
sessile nature, Vorticella spp. were consistently found
at depths down to 25 cm.
Flagellata (Figure 7.15)
The flagellates were generally far more numerous
— 3
than the ciliates, being countable in thousands cm , as
— 3
opposed to the tens and hundreds cm of the ciliates.
Maximum numbers occurred at or just below the sand surface,
with the highest densities of 7,400 cm ^ and 9,060 cm ^
occurring during the two summer runs (runs 4 and 5).
— 3
The lowest maximum of 174 cm” was recorded during run 8,
a run which was poorly populated by flagellates throughout
the 28 days over which it was sampled. Run 6 also produced
— 3
low flagellate densities (maximum of 916 cm ) and as with
A. costata and Oxvtricha sp., the flagellata also exhibited
surface avoidance throughout the duration of this run.

surface throughout a filtration run : Chilodonella sp..

Tachysoma pellionella, Aspidisca costata. Vorticella spp.,
Cinetochilum margaritaceum and Glaucoma sp. all feed on
bacteria, and the first two species,in common with the
flagellata (Sandon, 1932), also feed on diatoms and algae
(Bick, 1972). Noland (1925) found an association of
algivorous ciliates with water of low free CO^ content, as
found in algal habitats where the CO^ is taken up during
photosynthesis. This may partially account for the surface
avoidances of the other bacterivorous ciliates during the
latter stages of a run when the surface algal populations
became more dense. The other bacteria consuming ciliates :
Cyclidium heptatrichum and Oxytricha spp. do not always
seem to be able to survive the sand surface conditions but
appear able to obtain sufficient nourishment and oxygen
below the surface. During run 6 (October to November 1976)
the unfavourable surface conditions appear to have extended
to some depth in the sand, driving some of the ciliates
downwards as far as 15 cm. What caused this effect is
uncertain as neither the particulate organic carbon
densities nor the head loss gain during the run were in
any way unusual.
The seasonal occurrences of the maximum
population densities of these ciliates is indicated below
(Figure 7.18). Glaucoma sp. and A. costata colonised the
sand surface all year round, while Chilodonella sp. a
surface dweller and Oxytricha spp., which avoided the sand
surface during the latter stages of the filtration runs,
predominated from winter to spring. During the spring,
T. pellionella was also present in high numbers at the
surface.

During the summer, when higher primary productivity at
the surface of the bed would have indirectly (through
decay) provided greater populations of heterotrophic
bacteria, C. margaritaceum. Vorticella spp. and the
flagellates co-existed at the surface with the other two
perennial species; and in the autumn, C.heptatrichum
thrived below the sand surface, while Glaucoma sp. and
A. costata remained above them at the surface.
Stentor polymorphus. an omnivore, favoured the
region just below the sand surface, as also did
Lacrymaria olor and Litonotus spp. the most common
carnivores in bed 45. Here they were presumably able
to detect and consume their prey in the absence of high
detrital densities. L. olor was present in highest
densities from spring to autumn, while Litonotus spp.
thrived only during the summer runs and S. polymorphus
was most abundant in spring and early summer. Large
ciliates were also found to be characteristic of the
summer months by Finlay et al (1979) who studied the
benthic ciliate communities of a eutrophic loch.
7.3 Individual cell volumes and total biovolume of
the ciliates
The aim of this analysis was to determine whether
the depth at which the ciliates occurred in the sand had
any effect on either their individual cell size or their
total biomass. Biomass is represented here by estimated
biovolume, determined using equation 1 for all the
ciliates which could be approximated to an ellipsoid
shape. Biovolumes of species such as the Vorticella spp

167
Stentor polymorphus were estimated using the formula
for the volume of a cone (equation 2), and the stalks of
the Peritricha were measured separately, using the
formula for the volume of a tube (equation 3).

Where L = length of ciliate (stalk in equation 3)
W = width of ciliate

the species)

radius of stalk - equation 3
Measurements (L, W and r) of the first five
individuals of each species, recorded when counting the
ciliate densities, were averaged to give a mean cell size
per depth on each sampling occasion. From these data the
individual cell size and total biovolume of the dominant
ciliate species were calculated; Figure 7.19 illustrates
this data for run 8 (Appendix 7.4). The biovolume depth
distributions were very similar to those of the population
density, and individuals of each species did not vary
significantly in size with depth. When measured under
the microscope at a magnification of X 100, 1 division on
the eye-piece graticule used, was equivalent to a distance
of 2.74yim on the specimen. The measurements are

therefore likely to be inaccurate by a maximum of + 2.74^,
Cyclidium heptatrichum measured about 22 X 14yum which
gives it an estimated cell volume of 1.06 X lO^m. If
the measurements are varied by a maximum of + 2.74yuim,
the range of the resulting cell volumes lies between
7.68 X lO^y^m^ and 2.22 X 10^y^m^. It is therefore
impossible to interpret Figure 7.19 as showing that depth
has any effect on individual cell size as the cell volumes
did not vary greater than the error of the measurement.
During run 8, it was also apparent (Figure 7.19)
that the age of the bed had no effect on the cell size of
Cyclidium heptatrichum. Cinetochilum margaritaceum or
Tachysoma pellionella. However, Glaucoma sp. decreased
in cell size by about 40% between day 1 and day 9,
corresponding with a rapid increase in total biovolume,
while Aspidisca costata decreased in cell size by 42%
between days 17 and 28, corresponding with an overall
decrease in biovolume of the species below the sand
surface. The decrease in the cell size of Glaucoma sp.
was probably caused by a high rate of replication, while
that of A. costata seems more likely to have been caused
by worsening environmental conditions below the surface
during this late part of the filtration run, with an
associated general decline in the population.
7.4 Relationships between density depth distributions
and filtration rate
This section compares the depth distributions of
the ciliates and flagellates in bed 45 during run 6
(October/November, 1976) with those in bed 44 during the

170
same months when the filter beds were operating at 16” h”^
(0,4 mh ^) and 8” h ^ (0,2 mh ^) respectively. The depth
distributions in bed 44 (Appendix 7.2) are shown graphic­
ally in Figures 7.16 (ciliates) and 7.17 (flagellates).
Very few ciliates were recorded before day21 on bed 44 and
maximum numbers of most of the dominant species were
present at the surface on day 33 following an earlier
period of surface avoidance. A comparison of the maximum
densities recorded for the dominant ciliate species and
the flagellates, at the depth at which they occurred, in
beds 44 and 45, is given in Table 7.6.

In general, maximum densities were below the sand
surface during run 6 of bed 45; this may have been due
to adverse conditions at the surface but presumably could
be due to the higher rate cf filtration supplying sufficient

171
nutrients and oxygen deeper into the sand to support
populations of far greater density than those which
occurred in bed 44 at the surface. Very low population
densities were recorded below 7 cm in bed 44.
7.5 Relationship between the depth distribution of
ciliates and the concentration of particulate organic
carbon in the sand.
As, in general, both the carbon and ciliate densities
were greatest at or near the surface of the sand, decreasing
fairly rapidly in the top few centimetres and to a lesser
extent at greater depths, both densities were transformed
using a In transformation to convert these exponential
changes of density with depth to a more linear relationship
(a ln(n + 1) transformation was used for the ciliate
densities as some zero values were recorded). To look for
interdependence of ciliate density and particulate organic
carbon content throughout the depth of the sand cores, linear
regression analyses were performed on the transformed ciliate
and carbon data from the same depths in the cores, for
each sampling occasion, during each filtration run.
Between 6 and 9 pairs of data were taken from each core
(Appendix 7.5), this was restricted by the number of depths
examined for ciliates (Section 4.5). Regressions
significant at 95% or at a greater level of significance
(p&0.05) were accepted as showing a positive interdependence
of ciliate density and carbon concentration. These
regression analyses performed on the total number of
ciliates present against carbon content (Table 7.7),
indicate that only in the latter period of a filtration run

172
were the two densities interdependent throughout the
depth of the core. The slopes (b) of all the significant
regressions were positive, ranging from 0.323 to 2.354.
Analyses performed on individual ciliate species
showed very little interdependence between numbers and
carbon density; this was probably due to the low
frequencies of individual animals. The flagellate
frequencies were also found to be independent of the
carbon density.

Chapter 8 Temporal Distribution of Ciliates and Flagellates
Introduction
The aims of this part of the study were to detect
changes in cell sizes and densities of the ciliate and
flagellate populations both during a filtration run and at
different seasons of the year. It is convenient, where
possible, to be able to express the rate of change by a
single value, and the instantaneous rate, which was found
to be most suitable (Section 4.9), has been used through­
out this chapter. Doubling times of the dominant ciliate
species and the flagellates were also calculated in order
to compare this sand environment to other environments in
which the growth rates of protozoa have been studied.
The dynamics of the protozoan populations are effected by
a number of variables including food abundance and
availability, inter and intraspecffic competition,
temperature, dissolved oxygen conditions and flow rate.
Only a few of these variables were monitored during this
study, but an attempt has been made to relate these to the
population changes.
8.1 Variations in individual cell volume
Differences in cell volume occurring seasonally
were examined and related to effects of temperature, flow
rate and carbon content of the sand. Cell sizes were
calculated as described in Section 7.3, where no
significant change in cell volume was found to occur
either with depth on any one sampling occasion, or with
time during a filtration run.

174
Variation of individual cell volumes of the most
common ciliate species were calculated for all runs in
which measurements were recorded (runs 4 to 8 and the
bed 44 run), and these are shown in Table 8.1. The
error in measuring cell sizes (Section 7.3) would be
partly responsible for larger percentage variations in
volume with the smaller species, e.g. Glaucoma sp. than
with the larger species, e.g. Tachysoma pellionella.
Differences in size between a ciliate immediately prior to
replication and the resultant daughter cells would also
account for some of the observed variations.

* Cell measurements, from which the volumes were calculated,
were only recorded regularly from run 4 onwards.

175
The filtration rate had no apparent effect on the
average individual cell size of the common ciliate species
with the exceptions of Cyclidium heptatrichum and Aspidisea
costata. The range of volumes within the 95% confidence
limits of the means did not overlap with the former of these species
between run 6 (the fast rate) and bed 44 (the slow rate).
C. heptatrichum was considerably smaller in the slow rate
bed while A. costata was much larger in the slow rate than
in the fast rate bed. C. heptatrichum feeds on bacteria
in the water and at a slower flow rate these would be less
abundant. A. costata grazes on detrital floes,
dashing from one to another using its ventral cirri as
'legs* to propel it, hence a slower flow rate would
enable it to move and graze more easily.
Temperature appears to have some effect on individual
cell size (Fig. 8.1). For most of the common ciliate
species a decrease in size occurred with increasing ■
temperature up to about 12^C but further increases in
temperature were accompanied by an increase in cell size.
However, Aspidisca sp. showed a continuous decrease in size with
increasing temperature, this effect being stronger above
12^C, These size differences may be related to growth
and replication rates. The effect of temperature on these
rates is discussed later in this chapter (Section 8.3.1).
The average carbon content of the depths analysed
for ciliates sho\veda similar trend with temperature (Fig.
8.1), but the change in carbon was very little, varying only
o
between 218 and 254 yug C cm*" . To look for a relation­
ship between carbon content of the sand and cell size of
the ciliates, linear regression equations were calculated

All were insignificant, p > 0.05, suggesting that no
direct relationship exists between individual cell size
and particulate organic carbon density.
8.2 Changes in population density and biovolume
8.2.1 Density
The ciliates and flagellates were counted
3
and measured in 1 cm sand samples removed from eight
depths of the sand cores as described in section 4.5.
The frequency data obtained (Appendix 7.2) are plotted for
the total ciliate and flagellate populations (Figs. 8.2
and 8.3); however, these give no tangible indication of
changes in population density. From this data an estimate
2
of the population density, in a volume of sand of 1 cm
surface area and as deep as the lowest sample counted, was
calculated by numerical integration (Section 4.9), and
this value was divided by the lowest depth counted,
usually 25 cm, to give comparable values of density per
3
cm throughout the period of study (Appendix 8.1). These
densities derived from the integrals are plotted for the
total ciliates, the flagellates, Aspidisca costata and
Vorticella spp. (Figs. 8.4 - 8.7) with the linear regressions
calculated using all the original individual depth counts.
The slopes of the regressions represent the instantaneous
rate of increase or decrease in the population. A full
regression table is given in Appendix 8.2 for the
dominant ciliate species, the total ciliates and the
flagellate population. Those regressions having
significant slopes (p for regression 6 0.05) are
summarised in Table 8.2.

Most of the common genera showed a significant
instantaneous rate of population increase in the initial
stage of a filter bed run, reaching peak densities and
subsequently decreasing. The decrease although
significant on occasion was generally insignificant.
These population changes are shown in Figs. 8.4, 8.6 and 8.7
for Aspidisca costata. one of the dominant ciliate species,
the total ciliates and the flagellates respectively. However
Vorticella spp., peritrichs which grow attached by their
stalks to the sand grains, always showed a different
pattern of increase to the other ciliate species in that
they developed later in the filtration run and continued
to increase in density throughout the remainder of the
run (Fig. 8.5). The other ciliate species did not always reach
their peak densities on the same day although it was more
usual for them to do so. The age of the filtration run
at which these peaks were achieved varied between filtration
runs and was found to be negatively correlated with
temperature (Section 8.3.1),
There were deviations from this general pattern.
Runs 1 and 2 (March - April 1976) were the first two runs
following the resanding of Bed 45 in March 1976. As is
normal for re-sanded beds, these first two runs were very
short and the bed *jacked-up* after 11 and 14 days respect­
ively. (The term ’to jack-up’ describes the state of a
filter bed when the head loss per unit flow of water
through the bed suddenly increases very rapidly). As
discussed in Chapter 5 this rapid increase in head loss
is generally associated with a rapid accumulation of
surface organic carbon; however, after resanding, the

bed is biologically immature and the interstices become
blocked more rapidly,possibly due to the fact that there
is little biological assimilation of allocthanous organic
matter filtered from the water by the sand. As a result
of this, these runs were short and the ciliates increased
rapidly throughout them.
During the January/March run of 1977 (run 7), the
temperature of the surface water averaged 4^C and a
deviation from the normal pattern of change in population
density again occurred. The ciliates when considered all
together, increased slowly during the first 19 days of the
run and then levelled off to an instantaneous rate of
increase of 3.2% per day over the remaining days. Some
individual species increased at a constant but slow rate
over the entire run, e.g. Aspidisca costata and Cyclidium
heptatrichum. while others reached a peak density and then
declined, e.g. Tachysoma pellionella and Glaucoma sp. Of
particular interest were the flagellates, which remained
at the same density throughout the run.
Of the dominant ciliates, some species, e.g.
T. pellionella and A. costata were often more numerous than
others within the sand, and hence had a greater influence
on the rates of change in abundance of the ciliates when
treated all together. Table 8.3 lists the maximum
3
densities recorded per cm in each run for the common
ciliate species, the total ciliates and the flagellates,
(extracted from Appendix 7.2).

Although numerically abundant some of the smaller
ciliates, e.g. C. heptatrichum may not exert as great a
biological effect in the sand filter, by for instance,
predation on bacteria, as the relatively uncommon larger .
species, e.g. Stentor polymorphus and Loxophyllym sp.
Consequently the instantaneous rates of change in biovolume
were also examined (Section 8.2.2),

The significant instantaneous rates of growth
(Table 8.2) have been converted to doubling times, in
hours, (Table 8.4) in order to compare these values with
the available literature concerning ciliate growth rates.
The equation for this conversion is as follows;
. T = ln2 X 24
r
Where T = doubling time in hours
r = instantaneous rate of increase per day.

Very few records are available for naturally
occurring protozoan growth rates,as most measurements have
been made for ciliates grown in pure cultures of bacteria.
The available data is tabulated below (Table 8.5).
Fenchel (1968) grew ciliates in pure cultures of
food items varying from bacteria to diatoms and ciliates,
depending on the phagous nature of the ciliate under study
and recorded generation times between 2.4 hours for
Uronema sp. and 46 hours for Condylostoma patulum. The
lower generation time was for the smaller ciliate examined
while Condylostoma patulum was the largest. No similar
relationship was found between size and doubling time in
this study.

The doubling times recorded for the present study
rangedfrom 29 hours to 308 hours spanning the whole range
of values recorded elsewhere except for the very fast
doubling times achieved under certain culture conditions.
The slow sand filter environment was itself similar to a
chemostat culture system, in that a constant supply of
nutrientsand oxygen were available in the inflowing water
and metabolites were constantly being removed by the
downward flow of water. However, the food supply was
obviously not as nutritive as that of a laboratory
monoculture system.
8.2.2 Biovolume
Biovolumes obtained from cell measurements
(Section 7.3) were analysed as representative of cell
biomass, the two parameters differing only by a constant :
cell density. The ciliates were not measured during
runs 1 to 3 so no biovolume data are available for these
runs. Individual cell sizes of the numerically dominant
ciliates are listed in Table 8.1. As the individual
cell sizes did not vary appreciably during each run
(Section 8.1), the total biovolume of these species
(individual cell size X numerical abundance) increased and

192
decreased at the same instantaneous rates as did their
population densities- (numerical abundance) during each
filtration run. Consequently the ciliate phylum as a whole
increased in biovolume concurrent with the numerical
increase to peak density. However, as the population
density subsequently declined, the biovolume continued
to increase but at a lower rate. Figure 8.8 illustrates
this for run 8 while Figure 8.9 shows the increase in total
biovolume during the five filtration runs where cell volumes
wererecorded (these data are tabulated in Appendix 8.3).
The further increase in ciliate biovolume may be explained
by a succession from the smaller ciliate species to larger
forms such as Lacrymaria olor, Loxophyllum sp. and
particularly Stentor polymorphus, in addition to the cont­
inued increase in population density of Vorticella spp.
This species succession is illustrated in Table 8.6 for
filtration run 8.
Some seasonal variation occurred in the diversity of the
larger ciliate species present in the filter bed towards
the end of a run (Table 8.7) Euplotes sp. favoured the
autumn and winter months while Loxophyllum sp. and Uroleptus
sp. were present only in the summer and autumn. Stylonichia
mytilus, Lacrymaria olor and in particular. Stentor poly­
morphus were, however, present at the end of each run
regardless of the season, although their maximum biovolumes
were far greater between late spring and early autumn than
they were throughout the rest of the year. The lower
filtration rate of bed 44 apparently discouraged the larger
ciliates, as Stentor polymorphus was the only late coloniser
of the run on this bed.

Only three regressions were significant, however
the very low sample size ranging from n = 4 for Cyclidium
sp. to n = 8 for Tachysoma sp. and the total ciliates
(Table 8.2) is partly responsible for this, although a
more complex relationship involving other external
parameters, some of which are discussed later in this
section, may also exist. However, the ciliate population
as a whole was apparently influenced by temperature in its
rate of numerical increase having a Qio over temperatures
between 4 and 20^C of 1.55. A few runs giving data which
did not conform to the trend of the regressions were

Significant increases in maximum density occu^ed
between 4 and 12^C for Tachysoma sp. and Vorticella so.,
this being followed by a decline. However, the maximum
densities of Cinetochilum sp. and the total ciliates
continued to increase with temperature up to 20°C, the
highest temperature recorded in this study.
Figure 8.1 demonstrated a trend for ciliate species
to decrease in individual cell volume with temperature
increases from 4°C to 12°C, this being followed by an
increase in cell size at higher temperatures. This would
correspond with the variation of maximum density with
temperature recorded here for some species and the trend
for the rate of replication to increase with temperature

(Fig. 8.10). The general trend for the ciliate phylum
was for the growth rate and maximum cell density to increase
o
with temperature between 4 C and 20 C at 4.4% and 3.0%
respectively. However, there is by no means an empirical
relationship between these four parameters(cell size,
growth rate, maximum density and temperature) for all
species, e.g. the individual cell volume of Cinetochilum sp
decreased with increasing temperature from 4°C to 12°C,
but increased from 12°C to 20^C while the maximum density
recorded in 1 cm^ of sand increased from 4^0 right
through to 20°C, so an increase in cell size corresponded
with an increase in density between 12°C and 20°C. Other
parameters, e.g. greater food availability at higher
temperatures, may have been involved in supporting larger
populations of larger animals.
The days on which peak densities of ciliates were
achieved (Appendix 8.2) during the filtration runs were
found to be temperature related (Fig. 8.12, Table 8,10).

Runs 1 and 2 were omitted from the regressions as
they prematurely *jacked-up* following the resanding of
bed 45. Run 3 was also omitted. The day at which peak
densities were achieved was inversely related to temperature.
The gradient of this may be steeper than calculated here as
the density of ciliates probably increased beyond day 45 of
run 7 (4^C), however no further samples were taken after
day 45. At the lower rate of filtration the day. on which the
maximum ciliate population occurred was 6 days later
than that in bed 45 (i.e. it took 1-|- times as long)
corresponding to an instantaneous growth rate in bed .45
l-J- times greater than that of bed 44 (Table 8,2).
8.3.2 Carbon
The rate of numerical increase of the total
ciliate population was found to be related to the rate of
particulate organic carbon (P.O.C.) increase in the top
2 - 10 cm of sand during the period of high instantaneous
growth rates (b = 0.358, p = 0.025). The regression is
shown in Figure 8.13 and tabulated below(Table 8.11),

However, no valid relationship was found between
maximum ciliate densities and the P.OoC. contents of the
sand; nor between the day of peak population occurrence
and the carbon content. However, Figure 5.8 demonstrates
a change in gradient of carbon accumulation similar to that
undergone by the total ciliate biovolume. Figure 8.9,
suggesting that the two may be related or equally affected
by a third or other factors.
8.3.3 Rate of filtration
In bed 44 (8” hr”^) the ciliates and
flagellates developed over a period 1 to 2 weeks longer than
the time taken in the simultaneous run on bed 45 (16” hr”^).
The period of rapid growth lasted for 24 to 33 days in
bed 44 compared with 18 to 26 days in bed 45. The
instantaneous growth rates were generally about 10% per
day higher in the faster flow rate with the exception of
Cyclidium heptatrichum which had about the same growth
rate in both beds but which, as mentioned earlier (Section
8.1) was significantly smaller in biovolume in bed 44 than
it was in the faster flow rate of bed 45.
The maximum density achieved in total, in the slower
flow rate, was about 60% for the ciliates and 50% for the
flagellates of the densities achieved in bed 45 during this
period of rapid growth. The individual species differences were,
however, very varied. Vorticella spp.and Cyclidium
heptatrichum. both bacterial filter feeders, were present
in bed 44 at densities of 12% and 25% respectively of
those recorded in bed 45, while detrital grazers such as

206
Cinetochilum margaritaceum and Tachysoma pellionella
were present at very similar maximum densities in
both beds.
8.3.4. Dissolved Oxygen
From Figures 5.4a and 5.4b, by subtraction
cf "the area beneath the filtrate dissolved oxygen (d.o.) curve
from that beneath the top water d.o. curve, figures were
obtained for the oxygen balance of bed 45 during runs 5
and 8 (respectively the July/August 1976 and March/May
1977 runs). These are plotted in Figures 8.14 and 8.15.
Initially, while there was a developing algal community
on the bed surface the oxygen content of the filtrate
was lower than that of the top water, i.e. respiration
of the bed presumably by predominantly the bacterial
population exceeded its surface photosynthetic production
of oxygen. There then followed a period when photosynthetic
production of oxygen exceeded respiratory uptake and
finally once again respiration exceeded photosynthesis.
Between the latter two stages there was a point at which
photosynthetic production of the bed equalled respiratory
uptake; this occurred on day 11 of run 5 and day 17 of
run 8. In both runs these days were also those on which
maximum ciliate densities were recorded. Following this
balance, the total ciliate densities decreased while the
respiratory uptake of the filter bed increased. This
would suggest that the decrease in the smaller ciliates
may have been due to a deficiency of oxygen which the larger
ciliates were able to withstand.

Chapter 9 The Depth Distribution of Bacteria
Introduction
In this part of the study an attempt was made to
determine the speed at which bacterial populations
developed within the filter bed and whether a
constant population density was achieved after a certain
length of time, in order to examine whether the ciliate
colonisation bore any relationship to bacterial development
within the filter bed.
Using the sampling cores, a filtration run on Bed 44
(February 1978, 3.5^0) was monitored for surface associated
bacterial and total ciliate densities, and carbon concentra­
tions for the first ten days of a run. Unfortunately the
filtration rate was then decreased from 0.4m per hour to
0.2 m per hour. The relative abundance of surface
associated bacteria at depths from 1 cm to 24 cm was also
examined on a 'mature' 28 day old core using scanning
electron microscopy, and the densities observed on the
micrographs were compared with the densities obtained from
the younger cores using the epifluorescence enumeration
technique. The pilot-scale model filter column, designed
and u s e d by Lodge (1979) for the observation of depth
distributions of dissolved oxygen in the interstitial
water, was also used in this part of the study to monitor
the interstitial bacteria. The development of bacteria
in the interstitial water during the first week of a run
was monitored in the column on two occasions, using first
clean sand and then sand previously used for a filtration
run, thus simulating conditions of both the sand cores

210
and the filter bed respectively. It was also possible
to look for diurnal patterns in bacterial abundance
using the filter column.
9.1 Bacteria associated with the sand grain surfaces
9.1,1 Enumeration of bacteria by epifluorescence
microscopy
Estimates of the bacteria associated with the
sand grain surfaces were made by shaking the sand in sterile
water, staining the resulting supernatant with acridine
orange, filtering the stained bacteria onto a black
membrane and examining this by means of epifluorescence
microscopy as described in Section 4.7. As explained
earlier (Section 4.7.1) the shaking technique employed
removed approximately -J- of the bacteria, associated with
the sand surface, into suspension. However, this standard
procedure ensured comparable results although the actual
population density of surface associated bacteria was
probably in the order of three times that recorded.
During the ten day sampling period on Bed 44 in
February 1978, the temperature averaged 3.5^C. Sample
cores were analysed on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 and the
depth distribution data obtained for bacteria and ciliate -
densities, and particulate organic carbon content are
presented numerically in Appendix 9.1 and graphically in
Figures 9.1 to 9.3. (Due to lack of time for counting, no
data are available for the ciliate densities on days 4 and 10).
Bacterial densities were uniform with depth until
the second day, by which time highest numbers were recorded
at a depth of 10 cm (Fig. 9.1). On day 7, the maximum

density was present at 5 cm and had reached the surface
by day 8. An exponential curve was present on day 10,
with maximum densities at the surface, decreasing rapidly
down to a depth of 10 cm and thereafter remaining
relatively constant.
The depth distributions of ciliate densities
(Fig. 9.2) concurred with data recorded in bed 45 during
the January to March run of 1977 which had a mean
temperature of 4°C (Fig. 7.14). Maximum ciliate densities
were always present at the sand surface, with an exponential
decrease with depth developing by day 8. The distribution
of particulate organic carbon (Fig. 9.3) also followed the
general pattern recorded in bed 45 (Fig. 5.6) although
little surface accumulation occurred and higher concentrations
of carbon were more homogeneously distributed with depth.
The depth distribution data were integrated over the
depth of sand analysed - 30 cm for bacteria and carbon,
and 10 cm for the ciliates - to give an estimate of the
2
densities present in a column of sand of 1 cm cross
section, and these integrals were then divided by the
maximum depth analysed to give a comparitive density per
cm as described for the ciliates and flagellates (Section
8.2.1). The mean densities (Appendix 9.2) are plotted in
Figure 9.4 with the regression lines of change in density
with time which were derived from the raw data in
Appendix 9.1.
Both ciliate density and particulate organic carbon
concentration apparently increased at a constant but slow
rate throughout the 10 day run, while the bacterial

days and thereafter remained at a similar density (Fig. 9.4)
From the regression table (Table 9.1) the instantaneous
rates of increase of bacteria, ciliates and carbon are
seen to be highly significant.

It is of interest to compare the instantaneous rates
of increase for the ciliates and carbon recorded in this
run, to those of run 7 which took place at the same time
the previous year (1977), when the water was also at a
similar temperature of 4^C. The comparative data
(Table 9.2) are extremely similar, particularly for the
ciliates : 18.3% per day in 1977 (p^ 0.001) and 21.7% per
day in 1978 (p = 0.025).
Although the instantaneous rate of increase of
bacteria was only examined during this single run, it
would appear that they develop very early in a filtration
run and at a rate far greater than that recorded for the

217
ciliates or carbon. After this very short period of
logarithmic increase (164% d"^) the bacterial population
continued to increase but very slowly (7.4% d”^) until
day 8, after which a decrease was recorded over the following
2 days. However, there is insufficient data to suggest
that this decline represented a significant change in
bacterial density and a coincident, apparent decrease in
ciliate density was similary found to be statistically
insignificant. Ommission of the day 10 ciliate data from
the regression calculation also resulted in a decrease in
significance of the instantaneous ciliate growth rate
regression.

Whether bacterial development would be different at higher
temperatures and whether this steady population level of
bacteria would remain after 10 days or after the eventual
decline of the ciliate population is unknown. However, the
generation time of bacteria in two reservoirs was found to
be temperature independent by Straskrabova-Prokesova (1976).
The growth rate of 164% per day corresponds to a doubling
time of 10.14 hours. This value is a much larger

218
doubling time than those recorded for continuous culture
systems of 0.2 to 1.4 hours (Curds, 1971b; Straskrabova, 1977),
but is only twice the doubling time recorded by Bott and
Brock (1970) of 5 hours for periphytic bacteria attachedt o
glass slides in a cold sulphur spring.
9.1.2 Examination of sand grain surfaces by
scanning electron microscopy
From the study of bacterial populations
described above, it appeared that the bacteria associated
with sand grains developed in greatest density at the
surface after ten days (Fig, 9.1) but decreased rapidly
with depth to 10 cm below which they remained at a constant
level. Plates 9.1 and 9.2 are scanning electronmicrographs
of areas of the sand grains (prepared as described in
Section 4.7) both sheltered from and exposed to the water
currents through the sand,at depths from 1 to 20 cm in a
28 day old core. From these micrographs it is apparent
that the decrease in density recorded at lower depths may
not accurately represent the change in population abundance,
as the bacterial flora changes from predominantly short rod
forms, probably pseudomonads, in the surface 10 cm to more
filamentous forms deeper in the sand. Indeed, on exposed
surfaces (Plate 9.2) bacterial densities apparently increased
with depth. Plate 9.3 demonstrates clearly that at a
depth of 24 cm on rough and exposed surfaces a high
population density of bacteria may be found (Plate 9.3a)
while on smoother more sheltered surfaces at the same
depth a slime matrix may form (Plate 9.3d) and consequently
no bacteria would be recovered from this surface by the

shaking technique used for the enumeration of surface
associated bacteria .(Section 4.7.1).
These micrographs indicate that the bacterial
densities recorded in the first section of this chapter
represent mainly the short rod bacteria on exposed and
matrix free surfaces and as the relative covering of sand
grain surface by slime matrices and filamentous bacteria
increased with depth, a consequent apparent reduction in
the rod density with depth was, perhaps erroneously,
considered to represent a decrease in the bacterial
population as a whole. However, such slime matrices as
occurred in a 28 day old core, may not have developed by
day 10, the final day on which bacteria were removed by
the shaking technique.
9.2 Bacteria in the interstitial water
Enumeration of bacteria in the interstitial water
of a slow sand filter bed poses serious sampling problems.
However, a laboratory scale model (Plate 9.4) was designed
and used by Lodge (1979) to examine the oxygen regime at
various depths in a column of sand initially obtained from bed 45. The
model, 13.9 cm inner diameter, had a perforated perspex
base plate. Gravel was added to a depth of 10 cm above
the base plate and sand,taken either from the washing bay
or bed 45, was then added to a further depth of 60 cm.
The column of sand was backcharged to drive air out from
the interstices and was then drained down in order to place
sampling and redox probes at the required depths. The
column was then re-charged from the base and, once this was
completed, downward flow through the model filter was

Royal Holloway College).

224
begun by a feed from above the column. The rate of flow
was controlled by the effluent valve. Full details of
the column design and operation are given by Lodge (1979).
The sampling probes, initially designed for the
removal of water from the interstices for dissolved oxygen
determination, were found to be equally useful for
bacterial studies. The water flow into the sampling
apparatus from the probes was controlled such that it
equalled the rate of flow of water in the interstices
within the model filter. Analysis of these samples
(Section 4,7.2) was begun within minutes of sampling.
While samples were being taken in duplicate for
bacterial analysis, the redox probes inserted at the same
depths as the sampling probes were monitored in order to
gain an estimate of the oxidising capacity of the water.
Surface water temperature , head loss and dissolved oxygen
in the supply and effluent water were also monitored on
each sampling occasion.
9.2.1 Validation of the model filter column :
a comparison of carbon concentrations and
ciliate densities in the column and in sand
cores of the filter bed
It was only possible to analyse sand from the
model column for carbon concentration and ciliate densities
after it had been drained down at the end of an experiment.
Data are available for two such occasions (30.11.77 and
5.1.78) and these are compared below with data obtained
from sand core analyses during run 8 on bed 45 (March to

225
May 1977). This run had a similar water temperature
(7.5°C; the column feed water averaged 9°C), and data
from sampling days closest in age of the filtration run
to the column data have been used for the comparison.
(Tables 9.3 and 9.4, Fig. 9.5). The data have been trans­
formed from density per unit weight of sand (Appendix 9.3)
3
to density per cm for comparitive purposes using the
3
conversion factor : 1 cm = 1.598 g wet weight, determined
3
from 34 replicate weighings of 1 cm of sand.

Both carbon and ciliate densities in the model sand
column after eight days were far in excess of those
recorded in the cores at the same age of a filtration run,
the ratios varying from 1.33 to 8.80 for carbon and 0.39
to 17.08 for the ciliates. These differences were some­
what reduced by days 37 and 28. The 8 day column sample
was from a column run, operating with biologically mature
sand, i.e. it had been used in a previous run, unlike the
initially washed sand of the sample core with which it was
compared. This would account for the more rapid develop­
ment in the column sand relative to that in the core of
similar age. The 37 day column sample was, however, from a
column run operating initially with washed sand, from the
sand bays at Hampton, and was consequently more directly
comparable with the sample core of similar age. Figure 9.5
indicates that in comparing the two older samples (28 and
37 days), the model column may, for some reason, be more

228
productive below the surface layers than a filter bed
core, despite the precautions taken to black out the sand
below the surface to prevent light penetration (Lodge,
1979). The dissolved oxygen contents of surface and filtrate
waters during both column runs (9 mg l"^ to 11 mg l”^) did not
vary from those recorded in the filter bed at the corresponding
filtration ages.
9.2.2 Development of the population of interstitial
bacteria during a model filtration run
(a) Clean sand
The study of bacterial development in clean
sand was performed in order to examine the colonisation of
bacteria in the sand cores inserted into the slow sand
filters and in the top 30 cm of the filter bed sand during
the run immediately following resanding. The interstitial
water was monitored in the top 30 cm of the model filter
column sand over the first eleven days of a run in
January 1978 \vhich had. ai average temperature of 7^C. (Fig.
9.6, Appendix 9.4). All bacterial counts were performed
on duplicate setmples and the mean value taken. Low
4
densities of about 2 X 10 bacteria per ml. occurred in
the interstitial water throughout the monitored depth of
sand after one day. This had increased after five days to
a maximum density of 1.1 X 10^ bacteria per ml. at 5 cm
depth with half this number recorded at all other depths.
By day 7, the bacterial densities had decreased, the
maximum number of 6.5 X lo"^ ml"^ occurring still at 5 cm,
but by day 9 the bacteria had begun to accumulate at the
4
surface. After eleven days a maximum density of 8.5 X 10
ml”^ was recorded at the surface while below 5 cm, i to -J-
this number were present.

Total population estimates of bacteria, calculated

(Section 4.9.2), increased from 6.9 X 10^ 30ml“^ to
2.1 X 10^ 30ml”^ by day 5 (Table 9.5, Fig. 9.7a) but
subsequently decreased until day 9 (6.1 X 10^ 30ml”^)
after which the increase in density at the surface caused a
0 1
second increase to occur, reaching 10 30ml” by day 11.
These integrals describe the bacterial density in the
interstitial water of a column of sand where the volume
of water sampled from the interstices equalled 1 ml at each
cm depth examined between 1 and 30 cm.

(b) Sand used in a previous filter run
After the model filter column had been drained
following an experimental run, the surface layer of detritus
was removed, using a scraper which was lowered down from
the top of the column, and fresh sand was added to bring
the level back to the correct height for the probes.
The sand was then re-charged from below and another run
was started, eight days after the end of the previous one.
The aim of this experiment was to examine the colonisation
of bacteria in sand which had been previously used in a
filtration run, that is, to simulate the colonisation of
bacteria in a functional slow sand filter bed after it has
been drained, cleaned and put back into supply. The feed
water was at an average temperature of 9^C. After twenty
four hours, very high densities of bacteria (2.9 X 10^ ml”^)
were present in the interstitial water at 10 cm depth
(Fig. 9.6, Appendix 9,5) decreasing to about 2.0 X 10^ ml”^
at depths below this. The column of sand had been standing
dry for eight days, consequently the bacterial slime
associated with the sand grains would have dried out,,
so that once water started to flow through the interstices
again, these bacteria were washed off into suspension.
The presence of high bacterial counts in the filtrate
following resanding, reported in the annual report of
the Metropolitan Water Board (1971 - 1973), was also
thought to be caused by this exposure of the sand to
air instead of water. On the second day the densities
in the interstitial water were much lower and by day
f o u r a d istribution had d e v e l o p e d with
max i m u m densities (9 X 10^ bacteria ml ^ ) in the

233
surface sand, decreasing to 4.0 X 10^ ml”^ below 20 cm.
This depth pattern remained over the rest of the sampling
period, but the total bacterial population estimated by
numerical integration of the depths examined, decreased
over the seven day period from 6.5 X 10^ to 7.8 X lO^SOml”^
(Table 9.5, Fig. 9.7b).
To summarise this section concerning bacterial
colonisation of the filter beds; assuming the model column
is representative of an operational system, far greater
densities of bacteria were found to be associated with the
sand grain surfaces than were present in the interstitial
water. Maximum population estimates were 3.1 X 10^ 30cm ^
and 2.1 X 10^ 30ml ^ for the surface associated and
interstitial bacteria respectively in comparable core and
model column (filled with clean sand) samples. As the
technique for removing the bacteria associated with the
sand grain surfaces was found to be about 30% efficient
and as the porosity of the sand was about 39% (Section 5.4),
the maximum density of the surface associated bacterial
population was probably about 1,000 times that of the
interstitial population in a unit volume of sand.
The depth of maximum density of surface associated
bacteria was found at 10 cm on day 2 of the filter bed run
but had gradually moved to the surface by day 10. The
maximum density of interstitial bacteria also remained below
the surface at 5 cm until day 9 of the column run with clean
sand. The scanning electron micrographs of a 28 day old
core indicate that slime matrices enmeshing the bacteria
develop more with depth in a core of that age. If this

234
were also to occur gradually over the first ten days it
could be responsible for the movement of maximum densities,
either removed by shaking or dislodged by water currents,
towards the surface.
The very rapid instantaneous growth rate (164% d~^)
of surface associated bacteria recorded over the first 2
days was not apparently accompanied by an equivalent
increase in interstitial bacteria, although a maximum
density was achieved in the interstices by day 5, The
subsequent decline of interstitial bacteria may be
attributable to the development of filter feeding predators.
The changes in bacterial densities which may
reflect more accurately the changes which occur in filter
bed sand are those of the model filter run using previously
used (mature) sand, where the surface sand and debris of
the previous run had been replaced by clean sand. The
interstitial bacteria decreased throughout the seven days
of this run from 6.5 X 10® 30ml“^ to 7.8 X 10® 30ml" .
9.3 Changes in oxidation-reduction (REDOX) potential
during a model filter column run.
The redox potential did not fall below 350 mV at
all depths monitored down to 30 cm, in the model filter
column, throughout the experimental runs, demonstrating
that oxidising conditions prevailed in the interstitial
water of the sand column. During the run using washed
sand from the Hampton Works, (Fig. 9.8b,Appendix 9.6) the
redox potential varied only slightly with time, the depth
profile remaining similar with a peak of 520 to 560 mV at
2.5 cm below the surface. The surface potential was
lowest (370 to 410 mV) with a further low value consistently

recorded at 5 cm. Between 5 and 10 cm the redox
potential increased to a similar value to that at 2.5 cm, and
below 10 cm a further gradual increase was recorded down to 30 cm.
The low surface values again occurred regularly in
the run using sand which had already developed a biological
flora in a previous run (Hg. 9.8a), with a peak at 2.5 cm developing
after three days simultaneously with low values occurring
at 5 cm. The lower depths, below 10 cm, remained around
500 mV throughout the run. This unexpected depth profile
of Eh was also noted by Lodge (1979).
There was very little change of redox potential
with time (Fig. 9. 9 ) at any given depth, with the
exception of the 2.5 cm values, which increased by about
125 mV over the 7 day run in previously used sand, and by
35 mV during the last days of the run with clean sand.
However, as the latter was not continued past day 11, the
recorded increase may be artificial.
The gradual increase of redox potential with depth
is extremely puzzling. Oxygen produced at the surface
by the benthic phytoplankton may easily pass straight
into the sand producing good oxidising conditions just
below the surface. One would expect this to be greater
in previously used sand with a seed of phytoplankton, and also
to increase as it did with the duration of the run. The gradual
increase of potential with depth below 5 cm may have been
caused by decreased bacterial activity due possibly to
nutrient limitation. Although bacterial densities were
generally lower below 10 cm (Sections 9.1 and 9.2) the
difference was not as constant as the redox profiles

suggest that they should have been if they were the major
cause of the observed variations in redox potential.
9.4 Diurnal variations in the interstitial bacterial
density and redox profiles of the model filter
column
9.4,1 Diurnal variation of bacterial density in the
interstitial water
During the two twenty four hour experiments
with the model filter column filled with biologically mature
sand in January and February 1978, bacterial densities from
duplicate samples and redox potentials of the interstitial
water in the top 30 cm of sand, were recorded at intervals
of four hours. The water temperature remained constant
at 7.25^C and 4.5^C respectively during the two runs.
The relative densities of bacteria varied only
slightly with depth during the 24 hour periods studied
(Figs. 9.10, 9.11, Appendix 9.7) a maximum density
generally occurring at a depth of 2.5 to 5 cm. At the
lower temperature of 4.5°C the distribution was more eratic
with a further increase occurring below 20 cm, between 16.00
and 24.00 hours. Integrals were calculated as described
previously (Section 4.9.2) for both runs and were corrected
to values per ml. in order to compare mean bacterial densities
per ml at different times in each run and also between runs
(Table 9.6, Fig. 9.12). In the second 24hour run, the
mean densities calculated, indicated a gradual decrease in
the overall bacterial population during the whole period

(Fig. 9,12b) and this was thought to be possibly due
to the near freezing temperature of the feed water.
However the bacterial density in the feed water was also
found to vary considerably in both runs (Table 9.6, Fig.
9.12) and these densities were taken into account when
interpreting the changes in density of the interstitial
water. The feed water was extracted from immediately
above the sand surface for these determinations.

The absolute densities were higher in the second
run than in run 1, corresponding with higher bacterial
densities in the feed water during the second, colder run,
When the densities of bacteria in the interstitial water
of both runs were related to the bacterial density of
the overlying feed water (Fig. 9.12) very similar changes
in density oyer the 24 hour periods were apparent with
a definite peak occurring between 08.00 and 12.00 hours,

and a further peak at midnight recorded during the
warmer run. The morning peak probably reflects an
increase in primary productivity as the light intensity
increases during that part of the day, but a further
increase towards midnight is difficult to explain, unless
it reflects increased decomposition of organic material.
These findings suggest that the interstitial density of
bacteria is dependent on the density in the feed water
entering the sand, over a short term examination, rather
than the bacterial growth associated with sand grains.
Long term variations in the bacterial density of the
interstitial water are more probably dictated by the
biological activity within the filter bed.
9.4.2 Diurnal variations in redox potential
The redox profiles of the two twenty-four
hour runs differed considerably (Fig. 9.13, Appendix 9.8).
In the first run (Fig. 9.13a) it remained very similar
throughout the day, with minimum values of about 400 mV
recorded at the surface, and the depths between 5 and 30 cm
remaining at potentials between 500 and 550 mV. The
second run (Fig. 9.13b) was monitored only between 08.00
and 20.00. Apart from the 08.00 profile in which the
redox potential appeared to increase irregularly with depth,
at the other sampling times, the profiles were very similar,
a maximum of 575 mV occurring at the surface, this
decreasing rapidly in the 2.5 cm depth to around 450 mV
and then increasing back to about 500 mV at 5 cm, and
remaining at this level down to 30 cm.

The major differences between these runs occurred
in the top 2.5 cm (Fig. 9.14) and may be explained by
higher primary production occurring at the surface of the
more 'mature* sand of run 2,
The redox potential was consistent at around 400 mV
at the sand surface during run 1, but in run 2 there was a
rapid and continuous rise in Eh at the surface between
08.00 and 20.00 from 526 mV to 578 mV, with a corresponding
decrease in Eh at 2.5 cm, presumably caused by primary
productivity at the surface and high microbial activity
at 2.5 cm this being much reduced at the lower depths.
High bacterial densities were recorded at 5 cm during this
second run.

Chapter 10 Discussion
A graphical summary showing the concurrent changes
of the physical, chemical and biological variables measured
in slow sand filter bed number 44 and 45 is given in Figure 10.1
These include temperature, head loss, particulate organic
carbon (for the surface and for the total of an integrated
25 cm column) and ciliate densities (for the total of an
integrated column). The variation of these parameters
with time is illustrated for runs 3 to 8, on bed 45 and for
the bed 44 run, and these runs are placed in the calendar
year, thus allowing seasonal changes to be seen. Bed 44
which was run at 8 in h ^ (20 cm h”^) in contrast to the
faster rate of bed 45 (16 in h~^ (40 cm h ^)) was studied
during run 6.
Head loss is the means whereby the Water Industry
measures the filtering efficiency of the slow sand filters;
a rapid gain in head loss is taken to indicate loss in
efficiency and at a head loss of 1.5 to 2.0 m, a bed is
taken out of operation. Figure 10.1 allows the comparison
of the changes in head loss with changes in particulate
organic carbon and ciliate densities throughout a run, and
at different temperature conditions and seasons. The slope
of each of the graphs allows a rate of change to be calcul­
ated and, where the change is exponential, the rate calcul-
I* t
ated will be an instantaneous rate (e ) from which a doubling
time can be derived, if desired (= 0.6931/r).
The pattern of head loss during a filtration run on
bed 45 regularly demonstrated a dramatic gain after two to
three weeks of operation. This can be seen in runs 3, 6,
7 and 8 (Fig. 10.1). Runs 4 and 5 of June, July and

August proved an exception to this rule with a reduced
rate of gain in head loss occurring throughout these two
runs. During these summer months, dense growths of Clado-
phora developed two weeks or so after the beginning of a run,
the period of colonisation by filamentous algae also recorded
by Ridley (1971), and these may have been responsible for
this reduced rate of gain in head loss. The Cladophora
may pre-filter the water before it reaches the sand bed and
thus reduce clogging of the interstices, while it itself is
buoyed up above the sand surface by its own photosynthetic
oxygen production. This phenomena was first described by
Kemna (1899). At about the same time as the rapid
increase in head loss, in all runs except run 6, the surface
carbon density also increased by about 10-fold. During run
6 the surface carbon increased at a steady but much lower
rate throughout the run. The depth distribution of
ciliates in run 6 also differed from the other runs, and is
discussed later.
Bellinger (1978) observed that the algae at the
sand surface may be limited by low light levels caused by
the shading by planktonic algal crops. Such planktonic
algae, in the absence of Cladophora may have grown
sufficiently to limit light penetration to the bed surface,
resulting in the death of bottom-living algae and their
subsequent decomposition. Such an increase of detrital
matter may have caused the interstices to clog and at the
same time be responsible for a rapid increase in the
particulate organic carbon content of the surface sand.
As this rapid Accumulation of carbon at the sand surface

251
with a concurrent rapid increase in head loss was such a
regular feature of th-e filtration runs, it would seem most
likely to be caused by autochthonous organic products
rather than the sudden arrival of allochthonous material,
and the above theory seems a most likely explanation.
During the run on bed 44, which was operated at half
the flow rate of bed 45, the rate of gain in head loss was
fairly constant throughout the run, and showed a 3-fold
accumulation of surface carbon occurring slowly over a two
week period from day 10 to 24. The sudden increases in
head loss gain and surface carbon concentrations characteristic
of bed 45 (apart from runs 4 and 5) seems therefore to be
associated with the more rapid flow rate of this bed.
Algal crops in bed 44 were always much denser than those in
bed 45. Consequently, a similar straining effect to that
of Cladophora during the summer runs of bed 45, may well have
been occurring throughout the run on bed 44 in October and
November.
The removal of particulate organic carbon from the
filter bed top water (Fig. 5.5 and page 105) increased with
time during the filtration runs, and also increased seasonally
with temperature, both these effects corresponding with
increased biological activity. Logarithmic increases in
carbon concentration occurred between 2 and 10 cm depths in
the sand throughout all the filtration runs on bed 45 (Fig.
5.9) with the exception of the two summer runs 4 and 5.
During these two runs, the logarithmic increase at 2 - 10 cm
stopped early after 13 and 11 days respectively and thereafter
no significant change in concentration was recorded. This

252
would also be attributable to the pre-filtering properties
of the filter skin, predominantly Cladophora. suspended over
the sand surface at this time.
Ciliate densities were also found to increase
logarithmically over the first stage of each run, reaching
maximum densities after 10 to 19 days on bed 45, the period
of increase decreasing with rises in temperature from 4°C
to 20^C (Table 8.10, Fig. 8.12). The maximum ciliate
density generally coincided with the beginning of the more
rapid increase in head loss, so that ciliate numbers
declined as the head loss increased (Fig. 10.1). The three
exceptions to this observation were the two summer runs 4
and 5 and run 7. During runs 4 and 5 the ciliate population
declined after ten and eleven days respectively, although
there was little change in the low rate of head loss gain
throughout these runs. In run 7 the ciliate population
continued to increase, but did so very slowly, throughout
this cold, winter run (4^0). Maximum ciliate densities
achieved during runs 3, 4, 5 and 7 were very similar,
3
ranging between 4,100 and 5,050 in the 25 cm column of sand
sampled (Appendix 8.1) regardless of temperature, whereas
the instantaneous growth rate did increase with temperature
with a Qio of 1.6. Runs 6 and 8 achieved more extreme
ciliate densities of 8,950 and 2,968 respectively in the
3
integrated 25 cm sand column. It would seem that some
limitation of the filter bed inhibited further numerical
growth of the smaller ciliates but encouraged replication
of the larger carnivorous and omnivorous forms. These
colonised the bed at a time when the ciliate numbers were
decreasing and as a result the total ciliate biomass

253
(measured as biovolume) still continued to increase even
after maximal numbers had been achieved.
Run 6 was an unusual run in many respects,
particularly in its pattern of carbon accumulation and
ciliate depth distribution patterns. The much slower
accumulation of surface carbon of run 6 was not associated
with the rapid increase in head loss which began on
day 21 of the run. However, the ciliate maximum of
— 3
8,950 2 5cm did coincide with the start of the period
of high head loss gain. The increase of carbon content
throughout the sand column in run 6 was much more marked
than that occurring at the surface, and it is interesting
to note that most ciliate species exhibited surface
avoidance during this particular run (Fig. 7.4). Whereas
in all other runs the ciliate maximum was associated with
the high surface carbon levels, during run 6 maximum
numbers were generally found between 5 and 10 cm.
Ciliate density and carbon content can not be
directly related, as if this was so, the carbon content of
the sand in run 6 would have been more than twice the usual
level, corresponding with the particularly high maximum
ciliate density, which it was not. The carbon is more
probably representative of the bacterial densities present
in association with the detrital floes and the slime
matrices on the sand grain surfaces. As the ciliate
decline in numbers was associated with rapid increases in
carbon levels and head loss, it is possible that the cause
may have been unfavourable conditions of dissolved oxygen.
Once bacteria became well established in the filter beds.

254
living in the accumulated detritus, their high respiratory
demand may have rendered conditions unfavourable for the
smaller ciliates, enabling the larger species to survive
at their expense. This hypothesis is compounded by the
observations of the oxygen balance of the filter bed during
the two filtration runs where oxygen data for top water and
filtrate were available (runs 5 and 8), Once an algal
population had developed above the sand surface the
photosynthetic production of oxygen at the sand surface
exceeded respiratory uptake (Fig. 8.14 and 8.15). This
occurred between days 5 to 11 and 9 to 17 in runs 5 and 8
respectively. On days 11 and 17 of these two runs, the
two dissolved oxygen levels were balanced,and following
this the respiratory demand of the bed exceeded the
photosynthetic production. This resulted in an oxygen
deficit in the filtrate. These days of oxygen balance
coincided exactly with the days on which maximum ciliate
densities were recorded for these two runs (Table 8.10,
Page 201). Brink (1967) studied a biological sand filter
through which primary settled sewage was passed and he found
similarly that ciliates were recorded in greatest densities
in places where organic matter had accumulated. However,
what he assumed to be over-accumulation of the organic
matter resulted in the inhibition of further ciliate growth.
Up until the day on which maximum ciliate densities
occurred, the rate of numerical increase was also found to
be related to the rate of particulate organic carbon
accumulation throughout the top 10 cm of the sand cores,
excluding the surface content. Ciliate growth may therefore
have been dependent to some extent on the nutrient status

255
of the filter bed. As the majority of ciliate species
present during the initial phase of exponential numerical
increase, were bacterial feeders, a complementary study
was undertaken to examine the development of the bacterial
population over these first few days of a filtration run.
The bacteria were present both in suspension, providing food
for filter feeding ciliates, and also associated with
detrital floes and sand grain surfaces, providing food for
the grazing ciliates. The latter were examined in sample
sand cores extracted from the bed, A model filter column
was used to sample the interstitial bacteria, as well as
the oxidising capacity of the sand by means of redox probes.
Before accepting the results given by the model
filter, it was necessary to establish how representative
it was of sand in the sand cores or sand in the filter beds.
This was attempted by comparing both ciliate densities and
carbon concentrations from samples obtained from both the
filter bed cores and the model column. The column appeared
to be slightly more productive in carbon than the filter
bed (Fig, 9.6), but the depth distribution patterns were
very similar, and consequently the column was assumed to be
adequately representative of the sampling cores. Lodge
(1979) had reservations that the top water of the column
did not truly represent the filter bed top water. The
model filter was installed in a laboratory and consequently
the top water, which she obtained weekly from bed 45, did
not receive so much light as that of the filter bed during the
summer months. This would have resulted in lower algal production and a
consequent variation in particulate organic carbon and
dissolved oxygen content of the model filter sand relative

256
to that of the operational bed. However, in the present
study, the model filter was used in December, January and
February, the darker months of the year. Also, as the
column was run at 16" h ^, water was obtained from bed 45
every 4 days as opposed to weekly. The differences
between the model filter and operational bed top water may
therefore have been reduced. Indeed, the artificial lighting
of the model filter apparently resulted in a slightly greater
organic production than that of bed 45.
The column was used to study the development of
interstitial bacteria in both clean sand, representing the
sample cores and ^biologically mature* sand, representing
the filter bed.
This study showed that maximum bacterial densities
7 —3
of 1.5 X 10 cm" were found associated with the sand grain
surfaces at the sand water interface on day 10 of the filter
bed run, which was the final day of sampling. Densities
may therefore have increased further. This figure
represents only about 30% of the surface associated
population as this was the estimated efficiency of the
technique employed for enumeration of these bacteria
Q
(Section 4.7.1). Densities as high as 5 X 10 bacteria
3
per cm have been recorded for freshwater deposits using a
culture technique for enumeration (Henrici and McCoy, 1938),
however sands have been generally found to support
smaller bacterial populations than finer sediments (ZbBell,
1946; Dale, 1974). Maximum densities of interstitial
bacteria (8 X lo"^ ml"^) were achieved after eleven days
also at the surface in the experimental simulation of the
sample cores. As before this was the final sampling day

257
and densities may have increased further. This density
of suspended bacteria is low relative to those achieved
under culture conditions (Porter et al, 1979), where densities
of greater than 10^ ml ^ were reported to be necessary for
growth and reproduction of protozoans. The reason
why the bacterial feeders and in particular the filter
feeders, were smaller than those reported in the literature
(Table 6.1) may therefore be related to nutrient limitation.
Although the surface associated bacterial counts were
relatively high, they were achieved after thirty minutes
of vigorous shaking and may not therefore represent the
bacteria easily available for the grazing ciliates.
During a column run simulating the filter bed by
using ^biologically mature*sand, the interstitial bacteria
were relative 1 y abundant on the first day, at a depth of
10 cm(2.9 X 10^ ml”\ This was because they sloughed off
from the sand grains after they had dried out following
drainage of the column for removing the sand surface.
However, by day 7 the density had declined to a maximum of
3.5 X 10^ ml"^ which occurred at the sand surface.
The bacterial population associated with the sand
grain surfaces increased very rapidly at a rate of 164% per
day, to 7 X 10^ cmT^ over the first two days of the filter
bed run. After this initial rapid increase, further
7
development was slow with a maximum population of 1 X 10
cm"^ recorded after 8 days. Romanenko (1979) found a
similar pattern of population increase with bacteria from
the Rybinsk reservoir cultured in distilled water which had
a particulate organic carbon content of 1.5 mg 1 , about
5 times as much as that in the slow sand filter top water.

258
The reservoir bacteria increased rapidly to about 1.2 X 10
ml over the first 2 to 3 days and subsequently increased
very slowly to 1.75 X 10^ ml’^ after 40 days. The high
initial instantaneous rate of increase recorded in the
present study, corresponds to a doubling time (0.6391/r)
of 10 hours which is at the lower end of the range of 10
to 20 hours recorded by Fenchel and Harrison (1976), for
the initial bacterial colonisation of detrital particles
and is also lower than the values recorded (21 and 39 hours)
for bacterial development at two estuarine sites by
Meyer-Reil (1977). However, Aizaki (1979) recorded a
doubling time of 10.3 hours for bacteria grown on roughened
polyvinyl plates submerged in a river during January, with
a temperature range of 4°C to 9°C, which is similar to the
temperature of 3.5°C at which the present study was performed.
The relatively short doubling time of 10 hours
indicates that the bacterial population was highly active
during the first two days of the run. The supply of oxygen­
ated water and nutrients to the filter bed must render
conditions highly favourable for such rapid replication,
before the onset of colonisation by competitors and
predators. The rapid instantaneous growth rate of these
surface associated bacteria during the first 2 days of the
run, was not accompanied by an equivalent increase in
interstitial bacteria although a maximum integral density
of 2.1 X 10^ 30ml was achieved by day 5. The subsequent
decline to 6 X 10^ 30 ml"^ may have been attributable to the
development of filter feeding predators.

259
The order of ciliate colonisation of the filter bed
v/as apparently dependent on their holozoic nature.
Glaucoma sp., Cyclidium heptatrichum and C. margaritaceum
were the only common members of the subclass Hymenostomata
to colonise the sand, and they were exclusively early
colonisers. They all have an undulating membrane on the
right of the buccal cavity (Kudo, 1971) and it is most
pronounced with C. heptatrichum. enabling it to feed on
suspended interstitial bacteria. The other two hymenostomes
predominantly graze on settled bacteria, but may also feed
on suspended bacteria. Two small members of the subclass
Spirotricha, Tachysoma pellionella and Aspidisca costata,
were also regular early colonisers. The spirotrichs have
a well developed adorai zone of membranelles which winds
clockwise to the cytostome (Kudo, 1971) and they were
seen to graze on detrital floes. Both these spirotrichs
always initially colonised at the surface, where the first
detrital floes accumulated. The only representative of the
Hypostomata identified in the filter bed sand, Chilodonella
sp.. colonised after about a week and also grazed from
floes of detritus. The Peritricha and the Gymnostomata
were also late colonisers in addition to the larger
Spirotricha, e.g. Euplotes sp. and Stylonichia mytilus.
The peritrichs filter feed on suspended bacteria but they
must first become attached by a stalk to the sand grains
and being relatively large they would require a higher
bacterial density in order to thrive than the smaller
filter feeders, e.g. C. heptatrichum. The gymnostomes
are carnivorous and consequently require a healthy
population of flagellates and small ciliates in order to
thrive and the larger spirotrichs are omnivorous, feeding

260
on algae, flagellates and small ciliates.
The ciliates which colonised initially were those
which are small and consequently require less food, and which
also feed on suspended bacteria. In the model column
experiments, the suspended, interstitial, bacteria were
found to be largely dependent on the densities of bacteria
in the top water (Fig. 9.12) whereas the surface associated
bacteria, although found to colonise very rapidly, may have
taken a while to become established in floes on which the
grazers could feed. The omnivores, e.g. Stentor
polymorphus and the carnivores were limited by lack of food
initially, but after 2 to 3 weeks once their prey of small
ciliates and flagellates had become abundant they began to
establish themselves. The late colonisation of such large
species as Loxophyllum sp., Litonotus spp. and S. polymorphus
maintained the level of ciliate biomass while total ciliate
numbers declined. This dependence of size of the ciliate
population on the food availability has also been reported
by Noland (1925) and Fenchel (1969). Goulder (1974),
who studied benthic ciliate populations of a lake, found
larger populations at deeper sites where the sediment was
flocculant and thought to provide both shelter and food.
Seasonal variations in species diversity were noted
during this study and these were compared with similar
observations reported in the literature. Only two of the
common ciliate species were present in high numbers all
year round: Glaucoma sp. and Aspidisca costata (Fig. 7.18).
The temperature and dissolved oxygen (D.O.) tolerance limits
for these species of 0^ - 35°C, 0 - 14.2 mg 1”^ D.O. and

261
0° - 30°C, 0 - 22.4 mg 1 ^ D.O. respectively (Bick and
Kunze, 1971) were well outside the corresponding ranges of
4^ to 20^0 and 0.5 to 12.0 mg 1 ^ D.O. recorded in the
filtrate water over the annual cycle studied. Tachysoma
pellionella was most abundant during the spring, a phenomenon
also recorded by Wilbert (1969) and Cinetochilum
margaritaceum was most abundant during the summer, when
the dissolved oxygen content of the filtrate was low
ranging from 0.5 to 6 mg l"^ (Fig. 5.4a), the optimum
dissolved oxygen conditions for this ciliate according to
Bick and Kunze. The large carnivore. Stentor polymorphus^
was found to be characteristic of the late spring to early
autumn runs. Finlay et al (1979) noted a similar periodicity of
large ciliates in the benthos of Loch Airthrey, a eutrophic
loch. Lacrymaria olor. a large carnivore, was also most
abundant from spring to autumn, and was relatively infrequent
at the lower temperatures in winter.
The depth distribution of protozoa was also found
to vary seasonally, higher production of organic detritus
in the summer apparently providing a greater population of
bacteria at the sand surface for grazers, e.g. C. margaritaceum
and also for filter feeders, e.g. Vorticella spp. and the
flagellates. However, algal feeders such as Chilodonella
sp. and T. pellionella were found at the sand surface
throughout the year.
A further seasonal effect was recorded relating
temperature to individual ciliate cell size. For most
species, decreases in cell volume occurred with an increase
in temperature from 4°C to 12°C (Fig. 8.1), corresponding

262
with a gain in their instantaneous rate of numerical
increase between these temperatures (Fig. 8,10) but there­
after the individual cell size increased with further rises
in temperature to 20^C. Between 12^C and 20t this size increase
was also accompanied by a rise in instantaneous growth rate.
However, Aspidisca costata decreased in cell size with
increasing temperature between 4°C and 20°C, the effect
being greater above 12°C, so this species was not able to
grow in cell size simultaneously with an increasing rate of
numerical growth at the higher temperatures.
The depth distributions of the ciliates examined
during this study were generally of the pattern described
for marine sands (Fenchel, 1966), with maximum densities
occurring at the surface and decreasing rapidly in the top
few centimetres. However, this could not be related to an
oxygen gradient from a surface oxidised zone to a redox
discontinuity layer and then to an anaerobic zone, as was
the parameter found to be responsible for the vertical
distribution of ciliates in marine sand (Fenchel, 1967;
Fenchel, 1969). The sand filter water remained oxidised
throughout the year with the exception of a few summer
nights when the dissolved oxygen level fell to zero. With
the exclusion of these and anaerobic microzones which apparently
occurred at the surface of some sand grains sheltered from
the main water flow (Plate 9.3),no de-oxygenation occurred
throughout the filter bed. The anaerobic microzones were
implied from the presence of Sphaerotilus sp. and Leptothrix
sp. on some of the sand grain surfaces examined by scanning
electron microscopy. Studies on the model filter column
demonstrated an increase in redox potential with sand depth

263
over the first 2 to 3 centimetres (Fig. 9.8), below which
it remained fairly steady and high, at about 500 mV down to
30 centimetres, the lowest depth examined. This type of
depth profile was first recorded by Lodge (1979) in the
model filter column. The depth distribution of particulate
organic carbon was very similar to that of the ciliates,
with accumulation mainly occurring at the surface, the
concentration decreasing with depth to 10 cm, below which
it remained fairly constant. This would suggest that the
ciliate distribution was, not unexpectedly, dependent on
food availability assuming that particulate organic carbon
is representative of this. Maximum densities of bacteria
associated with the sand grains were detected at 10 cm just
after the start of a run, but by the tenth day they had
moved to the surface, the vertical distribution following
that described above for carbon. It would appear that
bacterial development was initially restricted, possibly by
predation, in the top few centimetres, but once the bacterial
population became established,the higher density of floe at
the surface naturally encouraging the development of a high
population of decomposer bacteria, the population of
predator ciliates began to develop more strongly. This
association of higher bacterial and protozoan activity at
the surface also correlates with a higher consumption rate
of oxygen per gm carbon recorded by Lodge (1979) at the
sand surface relative to that below 5 cm. She recorded
consumption rates of 25 and 1.25 mg 0^ h“^ respectively
for these two depth zones.
The localised distribution of bacteria on the sand
grains was examined more closely using scanning electron

264
microscopy (Plates 9.1 to 9.3). Sheltered areas on the
grain surfaces were "found to favour colonisation as has
also been reported by Meadows and Anderson (1966) and Weise
and Rheinheimer (1978), while HosselLand Baker (1977) found
a similar selection of sites for colonisation on submerged
macrophytes. In a 28 day old core, short rod bacteria were
found to predominate at the surface, being accompanied in
the deeper sand by larger, attached and filamentous forms
including Caulobacter sp. and Sphaerotilus sp. At depths
of 20 to 25 cm matrices of fibrous appearance were observed.
These have been described by Costerton et al (1978) and
have also been noted by Corpe (1970), Geesey et al (1977)
and Weise and Rheinheimer (1978) as means of facilitating
both surface attachment for the bacteria and also microcolony
development. The morphology of the short rods found near
the surface, make them a far more suitable food source for
protozoa than does that of the filamentous bacteria, and
this may partially account for the noted depth distribution
of the ciliates and flagellates. Güde (1979) similarly
reported a reduction of z o o flagellates which coincided with
a succession from single celled bacteria to spiral shaped
and filamentous forms, in an activated sludge culture. The
interstitial bacteria, monitored in the model filter column
were all of the short rod form and they demonstrated a very
similar depth distribution to that of the sand associated
populations, with the population maximum rising from 5 cm to
the surface by the ninth day of a run. The highest densities
were however recorded on day 5, the subsequent decrease
coinciding with increased predation by the development of the
protozoan population, both bacteria and ciliates finally
accumulating at the sand surface.

265
One might have expected ciliates at the surface to
have had larger individual cell sizes than those found at
the lower depths. However this did not occur, indeed
most cell sizes recorded in this study were lower than
those recorded in the literature (Table 6.1 Page 123)
possibly due to limitations imposed by the rate of replication
and the relatively poor nutrient levels available in slow
sand filter beds when compared with those of laboratory
cultures or activated sludge aeration tanks, from which
the comparitive cell size data were obtained.
Figure 10.2 is a composite diagram of the depth
distributions of ciliates, carbon and bacteria from runs
during similar periods of the year, in order to show the
interrelationships of these three within the sand filter
beds, as described above.
The instantaneous rates of numerical increase, from
the initial low ciliate populations of the core sand placed
into the filter bed, to the maximum densities achieved, was
examined in relation to a number of factors. Maximum
integral densities of between 4,100 and 5,050 individuals
were regularly recorded during each run on bed 45, however
the rate of numerical increase to achieve this maximum
density, increased with temperature, and consequently the
period of exponential growth decreased with increasing
temperature. The rate of numerical increase of the ciliate
population as a whole ranged from 18% per day at 4°C to 36%
per day at 20°C. The corresponding was calculated to
be 1.55 between 4° and 20^C. This value is similar to that
of 1.5 recorded for Tetrahymena sp. under culture conditions.

between 20°C and 28.6°C (Phelps, 1946) but is much lower
than those recorded in the literature for a similar
temperature range to that of the present study: 2.5 and
2.3 for Uronema sp. and Litonotus sp. (Fenchel, 1968) and
2.9 for Tetrahymena sp. (Phelps, 1946). However these
values obtained under well-fed culture conditions are not
strictly comparable with field studies as the former
provides ideal conditions for growth with no other limitations
to the rate of growth than that of temperature.
In general, the flagellates replicated at a slower
rate, achieving a maximum of 24% per day at 20^C.
Replication rates of different ciliate species varied:
Vorticella spp.. attached peritrichs, had a generally slow
replication rate of around 8% per day, while the spirotrich
Tachysoma pellionella had a maximum growth rate of 58% per
day. Vorticella spp., found mainly at the filter bed
surface, did not reach a peak in density during any run,
but maintained their slow rate of replication throughout each
run. During the winter run at 4°C, the rates of numerical
increase were low for the flagellates and for all the ciliate
species. Although the ciliate population as a whole did
not achieve a peak density during this run, some species,
e.g. Glaucoma sp. and T. pellionella did so, after 32 and 19
days respectively.
Fenchel (1968) found that in pure culture systems,
small ciliates had a lower doubling time and hence a
greater rate of replication than the larger ciliates. No
similar relationship was found during the present study,
possibly due to the relatively low nutrient levels of the
sand filter system. Indeed the doubling time of the

268
individual ciliate species ranged from 29 hours for
3
T. pellionella (6,150jxm ) to 308 hours for Glaucoma sp.
(835y^m ). These values span the whole range reported
in the literature for ciliates (Table 8.5 Page 190) except
for the very short doubling times achieved under certain
culture conditions (Legner et al, 1976; Taylor, 1978).
The rate of flow of water passing through the filter bed
was found to have a considerable effect on the biology
of the bed. During the filtration run on bed 44 (October/
November, 1976), the flow rate was half that of bed 45;
8" h ^ relative to 16" h ^ in the latter. As mentioned
earlier, the rates of carbon accumulation and head loss
gain were much lower in bed 44 than in bed 45 which was
monitored simultaneously with this run. An effect on the
vertical distribution of the ciliates was also noted, with
few individuals occurring below the 10 cm depth in bed 44
and peak densities of most species being located in the
surface sand of the bed. The higher flow rate on bed 45
resulted in a deeper penetration of the ciliates and-at
relatively high densities down to 25 cm, the lowest depth
regularly examined in the sample cores. This effect may
have been purely one of the increased rate of flow physically
transporting the ciliates further intDbed 45 than they were
transported in bed 44, or it may be that populations were
able to survive and replicate deeper in the sand of bed 45
due to a greater supply of nutrients and bacteria and/or
dissolved oxygen in the higher flow rate of water. No
oxygen data were available for the top water and filtrate
of bed 44 during the run examined, however the particulate
organic carbon content, measured as an indication of nutrient

269
status, in the sand below 10 cm was no less than that
recorded in bed 45 over the same period of time.
In general, no variation in ciliate cell size was
noted between the fast and slow flow rates. However,
two species: Cyclidium heptatrichum and Aspidisca costata
did vary considerably, the former was smaller and the latter
larger in bed 44 than in bed 45. C. heptatrichum feeds on
bacteria which it filters from the water using a large
undulating membrane. It would consequently ingest fewer
bacteria over the same period of time in the slower flow
of water than in the faster flow assuming that the bacterial
density of the influent water was the same in both beds.
This is a reasonable assumption, as both beds were fed from
the same water source, although the greater retention time
of the top water in bed 44 may have had some effect on its
bacterial population. A. costata however, grazes on
detrital floes, dashing from one to another using its
ventral cirri as ’legs* to propel it. The slower flow
rate would enable it to move and graze more easily without
the risk of being swept away.
The flow rate also affected the instantaneous rate
of numerical increase of both ciliate and flagellate
populations. At the slower flow rate, they developed at
a rate generally 10% lower than in the fast rate bed and
reached maximum densities about .2 weeks later, these
densities being on average 60% and 50% of those recorded
in bed 45 for the ciliates and flagellates respectively.
2
The peak ciliate density achieved was 4,475 per cm which
lies within the range of maxima achieved throughout the

270
year on bed 45, except for run 6 which was unusual (Fig. 10.1)
yielding a maximum of about 9,000 ciliates per cm^ of
core sample surface area.
Filter-feeding ciliates achieved much lower densities
in bed 44 than the grazers, probably due to the difficulty
of obtaining suspended bacteria in sufficient quantities.
Suggested Future Work
A useful continuation of this study would be to
examine in more detail the development of both surface-
associated and interstitial bacteria in the sand filter
environment, extending the period of examination passed
the time at which maximum protozoan densities are recorded.
Examination of algal and in particular diatom development
in relation to the late colonisation of omnivorous ciliates
in the filter beds may also be of considerable interest.
Further examination of the oxygen balance between
the top water and filtrate could also prove very useful,
particularly if in association with this the respiratory
oxygen demand of the component microfauna were also
determined.

Appendix 7.3 CALCULATION OF THE DOWm/ARD RATE OF FLOW
OF INTERSTITIAL WATER
Porosity of sand = 38.81% (See p.120)
/, rate at which water passes through the sand =
100/38.81 = 2.58 times as fast as in the surface
water.
Depth of top water through sand = 16" hr”^
= 40.64 cm hr“^
velocity of water passing through the sand
= 40.64 X 2.58 cm min”^
60
= 1.75 cm min”^
