also been encountered in mosses in the upper soil layer
(Foissner and Berger 1996; Bamforth 2001; Mieczan
2005). According to some authors (Foissner and Berger
1996), these species occur most commonly in oligo- and
beta-mesosaprobic environments. Grolie`re (1977) studied
the occurrence of these species in peat lands in eastern
France. Similar to species richness, the number of ciliates
wasalsosignificantlyhigher incryoconiteholescompared
with surface snow and streams. The abundance of ciliates
observed on the Ecology Glacier was higher than that
recorded on the Canada Glacier located in the McMurdo
Dry Valleys of Antarctica (Mueller and Pollard 2004).

ciliates decreased in habitats with low concentrations of
nutrients(particularlyconcentrations oftotal nitrogen) and

related to more favorable nutritional conditions at these
sites.Thisissupportedbyasignificantcorrelationbetween
