Author’s notes:
With the exception of the G lossary (Chapter 2) andThe Ciliate Taxa (Chapter 17) all chapters have been rewritten for the third
edition. The Glossary andThe Ciliate Taxa , originally from the second edition by John O. Corliss, have been extensively revised
and considerably expanded. Original illustrations of ciliate taxa drawn by Owen Lonsdale and reconstructions of the somatic
cortex illustrated by Jennie Knopp are contained throughout the book, except in Chapter 2.

Jacques Berger (1934–1995)
Jacques was my “academic father”, who I met with
his research crew in the summer of 1968 while I
was investigating the autecology of mosquito lar-
vae in Newfoundland, working for Marshall Laird.
Jacques’ sense of humor, his strong, well−founded
opinions, his broad and deep academic interests in
ciliates, baseball and golf, and in later years the his-
tory of science, attracted me to the academic life at a
time when I was considering a career in medicine.
Eugene B. Small
Gene, who I consider my “academic uncle”, has
been a colleague, with boundless enthusiasm for
the ciliates and life, always willing to engage in
discussion on topics as arcane as “the number of
ciliated kinetids in Kinety X” to the spiritual ele-
ments of Zen. As a mentor, Gene generously shared
both his deep intuitive insights into the taxonomic
significance of the cortical characters of ciliates
and his broad knowledge of ciliate diversity. Over
the years, our collaboration has been inspirational
and deeply rewarding.

John O. Corliss
J ohn, my “academic grandfather” as Jacques Berger
completed his Doctoral dissertation with John in
1964, has always been supportive of my career in
ciliatology. John has been a professional role model
by demonstrating outstanding devotion to students
and colleagues both far and wide, and to one’s disci-
pline. His willingness in 1997 to begin our collabora-
tion on a Third Edition demonstrated his enthusiasm
for “our wee beasties” and his confidence in our
partnership. For his trust, encouragement, and big-
hearted generosity, I am sincerely grateful.

from an ancestral Tetrahymena-like hymenostome. B Schematic drawings of the cyrtophorine
Chilodonella and of the mature form and the bud of the chonotrich Spirochona. Guilcher (1951)

Fig.1.3. The hierarchical organization of the ciliate cortex. The fundamental component of the cortex is the
dikinetid, an organellar complex here composed of seven unit organelles, which are the two kineto-
somes, two cilia (not shown), transverse (T) and postciliary (Pc) microtubular ribbons, and the
kinetodesmal fibril (Kd). In a patch of cortex, the microtubular ribbons and kinetodesmal fibrils
of adjacent kinetids are closely interrelated. The interrelated kinetids comprise the components of
the next higher level in the hierarchy, the organellar system called the kinetome. Two major
cortical organellar systems are the somatic region or kinetome and the oral region, functioning in
locomotion and feeding, respectively. (from Lynn & Small, 1981.) ................................................. 7

Fig. 3.1. Life history of the predatory apostome ciliate Phtorophrya as an example of the richness of char-
acters that can be derived from a study of the life cycle. Phtorophrya is a “hyperparasite” feeding
on the exuviotrophic apostome ciliate Gymnodinioides, which itself feeds on the exuvial fluids
of its crustacean host. After Gymnodinioides encysts as a phoront on the crustacean host’s cuticle
(stippled area), the tomite of Phtorophrya encysts as a phoront on Gymnodinioides!Phtorophrya
then penetrates the Gymnodinioides phoront wall and transforms to a young trophont that grows
to a mature trophont by feeding upon the cytoplasm of Gymnodinioides. The mature trophont of
Phtorophrya then becomes a tomont, dividing many times in palintomy to form multiple tomites,
which excyst to find a new host. (Modified from Chatton & Lwoff, 1935a.) ................................... 77

Fig. 4.2. Scheme of evolution of the ancestral ciliate oral and somatic cortex as proposed by Eisler (1992).
Step a – an ancestral flagellate with a cytostome (c) and paroral of dikinetids separates the right-
most kinetosome of each dikinetid (arrowhead) to form somatic Kinety 1 (K1). Step b – this process
is repeated (arrow) a number of times until the entire somatic cortex is covered by somatic
kineties (Kn). Step c – adoral structures derive from the differentiation of somatic kinetids to the
left of the cytostome. (Modified from Schlegel & Eisler, 1996.) ...................................................... 92

Fig. 4.8. Life cycle stages of ciliates. A microstome trophont, typically feeding on bacteria, grows from
the tomite stage until it roughly doubles in size to become a dividing tomont. This vegetative or
asexual cycle can repeat itself as long as food is present. If food becomes limiting the ciliate may
transform to a macrostome trophont, which is a cannibal form that can eat tomites and smaller
microstome trophonts or other ciliates. If food is limiting or other stressful environmental circum-
stances prevail, the ciliate may form a cyst or may transform into a theront, a rapidly swimming
dispersal stage. If the theront does not find food, it too may encyst. In unusual circumstances,
when food is depleted and a complementary mating type is present, the ciliates may fuse together
as conjugants and undergo the sexual process of conjugation ........................................................... 101

Fig. 4.15. Filter feeding ciliates can use their oral structures to function as a downstream filter feeder, which
creates a current with the cilia of the oral polykinetids and captures particles in the cilia of the
paroral, or as an upstream filter feeder, which both creates the current and captures the particles
using the cilia of the oral polykinetids. (Redrawn after Fenchel, 1980a.) ......................................... 111
Fig. 4.16. The clonal life cycle of a ciliate, modeled after Paramecium. After conjugation, the exconju-
gants separate and undergo growth and binary fissions transiting through an immaturity stage
during which conjugation is not possible. In maturity, the ciliates can conjugate with cells of
complementary mating type. If cells in the clone are unable to conjugate they undergo a period
of senescence with death temporarily delayed by autogamy or self-fertilization. (Redrawn after

Fig. 4.18. The nuclear events of conjugation, modeled after Tetrahymena. Two ciliates of complementary
mating type fuse (on the left) and their micronuclei undergo meiosis. One of the meiotic prod-
ucts survives and divides mitotically, giving rise to two gametic nuclei – one stationary and one
migratory. Fertilization occurs after the migratory gametic nuclei cross the conjugation bridge.
The synkaryon divides twice, in this case, and two products differentiate as macronuclei and two
differentiate as micronuclei. The old macronucleus becomes pycnotic and is resorbed. (Redrawn

Fig. 7.7. Division morphogenesis of representatives from each of the subclasses of the Class SPIROTRICHEA.
A Subclass Protocruziidia. In Protocruzia, stomatogenesis appears to be parakinetal here, involving
kinetosomal proliferation adjacent to the equatorial region of Kinety 1 (a,b) and then differentia-
tion of the adoral polykinetids and paroral (c-e) (from Grolière et al., 1980a). However, Foissner
(1996b) has evidence that it is mixokinetal, involving elements from the parental oral region.
B Subclass Hypotrichia. In Diophrys, the oral primordium begins development in a subsurface
pouch while five ventral streaks appear at the cell equator (a). The ventral streaks divide into an
anterior or proter and posterior or opisthe group (b,c). Cirral differentiation and migration occur
as the oral ciliature develops (c,d). (from Hill, 1981.) C Subclass Stichotrichia. In Parakahliella,
the oral primordium develops by kinetosomal proliferation on the ventral surface (a,b). Two sets
of ventral streaks - an anterior proter set and a posterior opisthe set develop and cirri differentiate
and migrate as the oral primordium continues to develop (c,d). (from Berger et al., 1985.) ........... 164
Fig. 7.8. Division morphogenesis of representatives from each of the subclasses of the Class SPIROTRICHEA.
A Subclass Stichotrichia. In Halteria, formerly an oligotrich, the oral primordium (arrowhead)
develops on the cell surface (a). New sets of bristle kinetosomes appear anterior and posterior
(arrows) to parental bristle kinetosomes, which eventually dedifferentiate as development proceeds
(b-d). (from Song, 1993.) B Subclass Choreotrichia. In Strombidinopsis, the oral primordium
begins development in a subsurface pouch (arrow) (a). Oral development proceeds to a “bar-
rel stave-like” formation (b, c), and then the opisthe’s oral structures expand out onto the cell
surface (d). Kinetosomal replication of somatic kinetids occurs within the kineties. (from Dale
& Lynn, 1998.) C Subclass Oligotrichia. In Strombidium, the oral primordium (arrow) begins
development on the cell surface in the region of junction between the ventral kinety and the girdle
kinety (a). As development of the oral primordium proceeds, there is kinetosomal replication in
the girdle and ventral kineties and a complex series of morphogenetic movements (b, c). (from

Fig. 9.6. Division morphogenesis of litostomes. A In the haptorian Spathidium, its holotelokinetal stoma-
togenesis begins with proliferation of circumoral dikinetids at the equator of all somatic kineties
(a,b). These kinetofragments bend rightward to extend across the interkinetal space and so form
the opisthe’s circumoral dikinetid as division morphogenesis is completed (c, d) (from Berger
et al., 1983). B In the entodiniomorphid Entodinium, what appears to be apokinetal is now con-
sidered cryptotelokinetal because there are somatic kinetosomes scattered throughout the cortex.
Kinetosomes first appear on the right ventral side (a) and as these proliferate to form a polybrach-
ykinety another field forms on the dorsal left side (b). These two primordia meet as replication
continues (c). Ultimately, a portion invaginates to become the infundibular or vestibular portion

Fig. 12.5. Division morphogenesis in the Class COLPODEA. A The merotelokinetal stomatogenesis of
Colpoda occurs within a division cyst and begins with complete dedifferentiation of the oral
structures (a, b). Kinetosomal proliferation then occurs at the anterior ends of several somatic
kineties (c) and the right and left oral structures dedifferentiate from different subsets of these
somatic kineties (d) (from Foissner, 1993a). B The pleurotelokinetal pattern is more widespread
within the class, exemplified here by Sorogena. Kinetosomal proliferation begins on several kine-
ties in the posterior right region of the body (a). A paroral and oral polykinetids begin to differen-
tiate along the anterior and posterior borders of the primordial field, respectively (b). As the field
rotates clockwise (c) and migrates anteriorly (d), these become the right and left oral structures
respectively. (from Bardele et al., 1991.) ........................................................................................... 254
Fig. 13.1. Life cycle of a typical prostome, Holophrya (formerly Prorodon) showing the two typical phases in
its life cycle. In the Starvation Cycle, the ciliate forms a resting cyst when deprived of food. In the
Reproduction Cycle, the ciliate may feed for some time without division. The protomont then forms
a division cyst in which the tomont undergoes palintomy to produce multiple tomites that either
encyst in resting cysts if there is no food or begin feeding again. Perhaps lacking a resting cyst stage,

A In the Subclass Peniculia, represented by Frontonia, stomatogenesis is considered ophryobuc-
cokinetal because it involves proliferation of kinetosomes from the parental paroral and from several
“ophryokineties” to the right of the oral region (a, b). As stomatogenesis proceeds, a new paroral
differentiates on the left of the field for the proter while the opisthe’s oral apparatus differentiates into
the three peniculi and a paroral as it migrates posteriorly (c,d). (from Song, 1995.) B In the Subclass
Scuticociliatia,Philaster represents the Order Philasterida. Stomatogenesis begins by proliferation of
kinetosomes from the parental paroral and the scutica, which resides in the director meridian between
Kineties 1 and n (a,b). Kinetosomes from the paroral migrate posteriorly along the right to form the
opisthe’s paroral and part of the oral polykinetids (c). As the proter’s paroral reconstitutes itself (d,e),
the opisthe’s oral structures take shape with the scutica appearing as a “hook−like” attachment at the
posterior end of the developing paroral. (from Coats & Small, 1976.) ................................................ 315

List of Figures xxxi
A large portion of the parental paroral dedifferentiates and kinetosomal replication occurs along
thisc segment or scutica, categorizing the stomatogenesis as scuticobuccokinetal (a,b). The oral
polykinetids and paroral for the opisthe begin to differentiate as they migrate posteriorly, leav-
ing the paroral of the proter to reassemble (c,d). Near the final stages, the scutica appears as a
J−shaped structure at the posterior end of the paroral in each cell (e). (from Ma et al., 2003a.)
B In the Subclass Hymenostomatia, Tetrahymena is the classic example of parakinetal stomatogen-
esis. Kinetosomes proliferate along the equator of what is defined as Kinety 1 or the stomatogenic
kinety (a,b). As this proliferation continues, development of the oral structures takes place from
the anterior towards the posterior and from the right towards the left (c–e) (redrawn after Grolière,
1975a).C In the Subclass Apostomatia, Hyalophysa shows what have been interpreted as stoma-
togenesis during tomite development. Three closely spaced kineties, designated a,b, and c, overly
a small kinetofragment (* in a), which develops as the rosette. These three kineties themselves
undergo dedifferentiation and redifferentiation to produce the kinetal structures of the mature
tomite (b–e). The homologies with other oligohymenophoreans are very difficult to see. (from

as if viewed from the inside of the cell. The key to the kinetid structures is as follows: (a) kineto-
some; (b) overlapping postciliary microtubular ribbons forming postciliodesma; (c) convergent
postciliary microtubular ribbon; (d) divergent postciliary microtubular ribbon; (e) striated kine-
todesmal fibril; (f) radial transverse microtubular ribbon; (g) tangential transverse microtubular
ribbon; (h) overlapping transverse microtubular ribbons, the so-called transversodesma. (Redrawn

Abstract The history of ciliate systematics has among organisms by n atural c lassifications: these

of these periods arose through an interaction of significant particular characters are in inferring
technology and conceptual views. For example, relationships, and these conceptual views, in their

2 1. Introduction and Progress in the Last Half Century
1 .1 The A ges of Discovery focused on the character of the somatic and oral
ciliature and on a consideration that evolution
(1880–1930) and E xploitation
proceeded from simpler forms to more complex
(1930–1950)
forms. This is reflected in the characterization of
the higher taxa by Bütschli as Holotricha – evenly
Bütschli (1887–1889) and Kahl (1930–1935), exem- covered by somatic cilia – and Spirotricha – with a

by Kahl, equivalent to Holotricha and Spirotricha

characters of the argyrome that can be taxonomically
useful (Fig. 3.3). Even more generally useful, are
features of the kinetome – the organellar system
composed of all kinetids covering the body of a
given ciliate. Here, a large number of characters
can be measured, depending upon the ciliate.
These could include qualitative characters, such
as, whether and where there are monokinetids ,
d ikinetids, or p olykinetids and what is the nature
of their ciliation (Fig. 3.2). As well, quantita-
tive characters can be measured, such as the total
number of s omatic kineties, the number of k inetids
in a particular kinety, the number of postoral kine-
ties , and the number of somatic kineties on the left
side and right side of the body. How the kineties
converge to form s uture lines or s ecant systems
can also be important (Fig. 3.3). Ultimately, refer-
ence to the pertinent recent literature that properly
describes new species will provide an exhaustive
set of characters. It is important to obtain measure-
ments on at least a statistical minimum number of
cells, ideally at least 30 (Berger, 1978).
It is generally essential to use stained prepara-
tions to discover the details of the oral ciliature.
Prostomial ciliates often have simple oral struc-
tures, like m onokinetids and d ikinetids, which are
not easily visible in living specimens (Fig. 3.2).
V entrostomial ciliates may have significantly larger
oral structures and many more of them. Although

additional layer, internal to the layer commonly
found (Grain, 1966a; Paul, Butler, & Williams,
1989). The proteins of the epiplasm and ecto-endo-
plasmic layer of trichostomes have been isolated
and found to differ. Filamentous proteins , ranging
in molecular weight between 58–96 kDa, are the
major constituent of the e piplasm of Entodinium
and Polyplastron (Vigues & David, 1989; Vigues,
Méténier, & Sénaud, 1984b), while the 4 nm fila-
ments of the ecto-endoplasmic layer of I sotricha
are about 22 kDa in size (Vigues, Méténier, &
Grolière, 1984a). These proteins are C a 2+ -binding
proteins, which show antigenic similarity to those
of the e cto-endoplasmic layer of Polyplastron
(Vigues & Grolière, 1985). The filaments of the
e cto-endoplasmic layer can be specialized to ena-

S uctorians are unusual among ciliates in lacking
a cytoproct . Thus, wastes accumulate in the cyto-
plasm during the lifespan of a cell. Nevertheless,
Batisse (1994b) noted that some s uctorians,
although lacking the c ytoproct, can eliminate waste:
Thecacineta may sequester wastes in the cell apex
and sever this periodically, while D endrosoma and
Ephelota may eliminate wastes near the base of
the tentacles . Rudzinska (1962) has demonstrated
that overfeeding shortens the adult life span of
Tokophrya, probably due to the accumulation of
wastes. While lifespans of cells varied consider-
ably, even within a clone, the average lifespan of
cells decreased as the clonal life cycle progressed
(see Nuclei, Sexuality and Life Cycle below)
(Colgin-Bukovsan, 1979; Karakashian, Lanners, &
Rudzinska, 1984).
10.3 Somatic Structures
It is difficult to generalize about the body shape
and size of p hyllopharyngeans. Some free-living
cyrtophorians and most rhynchodians are very
small ciliates, less than 50 µm in length, but typi-
cally ovoid in shape (Figs. 10.1, 10.3). C honotrichs
have a basic groundplan of basal portion and cone-
shaped apex (Fig. 10.2). However, the cell body
can reside on a s talk of considerable length, up
to 600 µm in some O xychonina species, while the
neck can be extended and quite elongated in some
Filichona species (Jankowski, 1973b). Suctorians,
like c honotrichs, can be attached directly to the
substrate or elevated off it on a stalk (Figs. 10.4–
10.6). In those species attached to the substrate,
body form can be quite variable. Batisse (1994b)
recognized five major morphological types (i.e.,
monaxon –Podophrya ; homaxon – Sphaerophrya ;
radial –Cyclophrya; bilateral – Stylophryodendron ;
and irregular – Lernaeophrya , Dendrosoma ), but
acknowledged it was not easy to classify a form

dikinetids dissociate during stomatogenesis so that
“posterior” kinetosomes remain associated with the
nematodesmata while a few “anterior” kinetosomes
that are not resorbed remain as “residual kineto-
somes” posterior to the cytostome (Peck, 1975;
Thompson & Corliss, 1958). In most Nassula
species, the “oral” polykinetids course on the left
ventral surface, posterior to the cytostome, and
may extend onto the dorsal surface.
“Oral” structures in the synhymeniids differ

cling the entire body as the so-called s ynhymenium
(e.g., Nassulopsis) . Second, they are composed of
dikinetids or polykinetids of typically no more than
six kinetosomes (Fig. 11.1). However, in scaphidi-
odontids and orthodonellids , the extension of the
synhymenium into the anterior suture recalls the
overall pattern of c yrtophorians (cf. Figs. 10.1,
11.1) (Deroux, 1994b). There has been no detailed
ultrastructural description of the synhymenium
kinetids nor of the c ytopharyngeal basket of s yn-
hymeniids to determine that it shows strong simi-

A In the Subclass P eniculia , represented by F rontonia , stomatogenesis is considered o phryobuccokinetal because it
involves proliferation of kinetosomes from the parental paroral and from several “ ophryokineties” to the right of the
oral region (a , b) . As s tomatogenesis proceeds, a new paroral differentiates on the left of the field for the proter while

Kineties 1 and n (a , b ). Kinetosomes from the paroral migrate posteriorly along the right to form the opisthe’s paroral
and part of the oral polykinetids (c ). As the proter’s paroral reconstitutes itself (d , e ), the opisthe’s oral structures take
shape with thescutica appearing as a “hook-like” attachment at the posterior end of the developing paroral. (from

A In the Subclass Scuticociliatia , Pleuronema represents the Order P leuronematida. A large portion of the parental
paroral dedifferentiates and kinetosomal replication occurs along thisc segment or scutica , categorizing the stoma-
togenesis as s cuticobuccokinetal ( a , b) . The oral polykinetids and paroral for the opisthe begin to differentiate as they
migrate posteriorly, leaving the paroral of the proter to reassemble (c , d ). Near the final stages, the scutica appears
as a J-shaped structure at the posterior end of the paroral in each cell (e ). (From Ma et al., 2003a.) B In the Subclass
Hymenostomatia , Tetrahymena is the classic example of p arakinetal stomatogenesis. K inetosomes proliferate along
the equator of what is defined as Kinety 1 or the s tomatogenic kinety (a , b ). As this proliferation continues, devel-
opment of the oral structures takes place from the anterior towards the posterior and from the right towards the left
(c–e) (redrawn after Grolière, 1975a). C In the Subclass Apostomatia , Hyalophysa shows what have been interpreted
as stomatogenesis during tomite development. Three closely spaced kineties, designated a , b , and c , overly a small
kinetofragment (* ina ), which develops as the rosette . These three kineties themselves undergo dedifferentiation and
redifferentiation to produce the kinetal structures of the mature tomite ( b–e ). The homologies with other oligohy-

(Figs. 16.6, 16.7). This analysis will provide some
of the evidential basis for the higher classification
presented inChapter 17 .
The ciliate tree is deeply divided into two
major lineages. Mapping the presence of post-
ciliodesmata on the tree demonstrates that this
character is restricted to one of these two major lin-
eages, which is now recognized as the Subphylum
P ostciliodesmatophora (Fig. 16.6A) (Lynn, 1996a).
T he next five characters are all related to nuclear
features. The other major lineage of ciliates has the
major unifying feature of dividing the m acronucleus
primarily by using intramacronuclear microtubules .
Distribution of this character on the tree supports
recognition of the Subphylum Intramacronucleata
(Fig. 16.6B) (Lynn, 1996a). The other major lineage
with dividing macronuclei uses e xtramacronuclear
microtubules in the division process. Distribution
of this character on the tree supports recognition of
the Class H ETEROTRICHEA, which is also char-
acterized by postciliodesmata whose ribbons are
separated by a single microtubule (Fig. 16.6C) ( see
Chapter 6) . The third nuclear character is the pres-
ence of non-dividing macronuclei. Distribution of
this character on the tree supports recognition of the
Class K ARYORELICTEA, which is also character-
ized by postciliodesmata whose ribbons are sepa-
rated by the 2+ribbon+1 microtubular arrangement
(Fig. 16.6D) (s ee Chapter 5) . As noted earlier, the

Katz (2001) argued that c hromosomal fragmen-
tation may have had multiple origins. However,
these three lineages often find their place at
the “base” of the intramacronucleate radiation in
gene sequence trees, sometimes separated by the
Class L ITOSTOMATEA (Fig. 16.7A). Thus, a
common molecular mechanism of p olytenization
and g enome fragmentation possibly underlies the
explosive diversification of i ntramacronucleates.
This mechanism has been refined or lost secondar-
ily, at least twice, as this radiation diverged: it may
have been lost in the common ancestor to the Class
LITOSTOMATEA and in the common ancestor of
the NASSOPHOREA - OLIGOHYMENOPHOREA
clade (Fig. 16.7A).
T he final nuclear feature is the presence of
replication bands , which pass through the macro-
nuclear karyoplasm during the S phase of DNA
synthesis. Distribution of this character is restricted
to lineages in the Class SPIROTRICHEA , and with
the exception of Protocruzia, provides a rationale
for the monophyly of this group (Fig. 16.7B) ( see
Chapter 7 ).
F inally, two features that have been considered
important in systematic discussions are the pres-
ence of somatic monokinetids or somatic dikinetids
and the kinds of s tomatogenesis. Lynn and Small
(1981) argued that the dikinetid state was likely
the ancestral state for the ciliates, considering that
