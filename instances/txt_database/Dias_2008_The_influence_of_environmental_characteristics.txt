Abstract
The aim of this research was to study the ciliated protozoa community at three sampling stations that receive different
levels of domestic sewage along the São Pedro Stream in the municipality of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in
order to determine the influence of organic pollution on this community and to assess the feasibility of using ciliates
as water quality indicators. Four physical-chemical parameters of the water samples were evaluated: dissolved oxygen
concentration, electrical conductivity, pH and temperature. The sediment was obtained manually, using dredges with
capacity of 300 mL, at each collection point. Point 1 was located in a rural region that receives a low sewage load,
while Points 2 and 3 were located in populated regions receiving high sewage loads. We found 22 ciliate species, of
which 18 are included in the saprobic system and are considered bioindicators. These showed beta-mesosaprobic envi-
ronments at Point 1 and alfa-mesosaprobic to polisaprobic environments at Points 2 and 3. The low levels of dissolved
oxygen and the high electrical conductivity values at Points 2 and 3, together with the strong similarity between the
ciliate taxocenoses of these points and the weak similarity between Point 1 and the other two, confirm the high sewage
loads received at the latter two points. The combination of the biological indicators and physical-chemical analyses
therefore proved itself to be an efficient method of evaluating water quality, and has excellent potential to support deci-
sions on the conservation of headwaters and recuperation of degraded environments in lotic systems.
Keywords: ciliated protozoa, organic pollution, water quality, watercourses.
Influência das características ambientais sobre distribuição dos ciliados

Resumo
O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a comunidade de protozoários ciliados em três estações amostrais, que recebem
diferentes níveis de lançamento de esgoto doméstico, ao longo do córrego São Pedro, Juiz de Fora, MG, a fim de se de-
terminar a influência da poluição orgânica sobre a composição e distribuição desta comunidade e avaliar a viabilidade
da utilização dos ciliados como indicadores da qualidade da água. Foram mensurados quatro parâmetros físico-quími-
cos da água amostrada: teor de oxigênio dissolvido, condutividade elétrica, pH e temperatura. Amostras do sedimento
foram obtidas manualmente com o auxílio de dragas, com capacidade de 300 mL, em cada ponto de coleta. O ponto1,
localizado em uma região rural, recebe baixa carga de esgoto, enquanto os pontos 2 e 3, localizados em regiões com
ampla ocupação humana, recebem altas cargas de esgoto. Foram registradas 22 espécies de ciliados, sendo que 18
estão incluídas no sistema sapróbio e são consideradas bioindicadoras de ambientes beta-mesossapróbio no ponto 1 e
de alfa a polissapróbio nos pontos 2 e 3. Os baixos valores de oxigênio dissolvido e os altos valores de condutividade
elétrica registrados nas estações 2 e 3, juntamente com a similaridade entre a taxocenose de ciliados destas estações
e a baixa similaridade entre a estação 1 e as demais, confirmaram as altas cargas de esgoto recebidas nestas estações.
A união do método biológico com a análise físico-química mostrou-se, portanto, um eficiente método na avaliação
da qualidade da água, e apresenta grande potencial de utilização em tomadas de decisões relativas à conservação de
nascentes e recuperação de ambientes degradados em sistemas lóticos.
Palavras-chave: águas correntes, poluição orgânica, protozoários ciliados, qualidade da água.
