Abstract. Four earthworm species, the endogeic Octolasion tyrtaeum (Savigny, 1826), the anecic
Lumbricus terrestris Linnaeus, 1758 as well as the epigeic Eisenia fetida (Savigny, 1826) and
Dendrobaena veneta (Rosa, 1886), were examined for the presence of astome ciliates. Based on the
integrative taxonomic approach, five ciliate species were recognized in their gastrointestinal tracts:
Metaradiophrya lumbrici (Dujardin, 1841), M. varians (de Puytorac, 1954), Anoplophrya lumbrici
(Schrank, 1803), A. vulgaris de Puytorac, 1954 and A. nodulata (Dujardin, 1841). Their distinctness was
assessed using the multivariate morphometric approach and molecular phylogenetic analyses. Although
the two species of Metaradiophrya Jankowski, 2007 on the one hand and the two former species of
Anoplophrya Stein, 1860 on the other, were not distinctly separated by the multivariate morphometric
analyses, they were clearly delimited by the 18S rRNA gene sequences. Species within each genus also
differed by their hosts, M. lumbrici and A. lumbrici occurred only in anecic earthworms while M. varians
and A. vulgaris occured exclusively in epigeic earthworms. Only a single species, A. nodulata, was
detected in endogeic earthworms. It was morphologically distinct from and did not cluster with the
two other species of Anoplophrya but was nested within the paraphyletic assemblage containing other
astomes from endogeic earthworms. This indicates that the evolution of endosymbiotic ciliates from
earthworms has very likely proceeded through a specialization to various ecological groups of their host
organisms.

Introduction
The subclass Astomatia Schewiakoff, 1896 unites ciliates lacking cytostome, cytopharynx and all
oral ciliary structures, such as paroral membrane or adoral organelles. Based on the ultrastructural
and molecular data, mouthless (astome) ciliates are classified within the species-rich and highly
morphologically as well as ecologically diverse class Oligohymenophorea de Puytorac et al., 1974

(Lynn 2008; Fokam et al. 2011; Rataj & Vďačný 2018, 2019). Astomes are endosymbionts typically
inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of a huge variety of animals, ranging from turbellarians (e.g., von
Siebold 1839; Schultze 1851; Kijenskij 1926; de Puytorac 1957, 1963; Sikora 1963; Corliss et al.
1965), mollusks (Lom 1959) and annelids (for reviews, see Cépède 1910 and de Puytorac 1954, 1969,
1972) to newts and frogs (e.g., Maupas 1879; Bush 1933, 1934; Kay 1942; McAllister et al. 1993;
McAllister & Trauth 1996). The majority of astome ciliates has been, however, discovered in annelids
including polychaetes (de Puytorac 1954; de Puytorac & Schrével 1965; Sauvadet et al. 2017), leeches
and, especially, in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial oligochaetes (e.g., Cépède 1910; Rossolimo 1926a,
1926b; Heidenreich 1935; de Puytorac 1954, 1969, 1972; Ngassam 1983; Ngassam et al. 1998; Fokam
et al. 2008, 2015, 2016).
The gastrointestinal tract of earthworms from the oligochaete family Lumbricidae Rafinesque-
Schmaltz, 1815 is inhabited by astomes belonging to only three genera: Metaradiophrya Jankowski,
2007, Anoplophrya Stein, 1860 and Maupasella Cépède, 1910 (Heidenreich 1935; Lom 1961; de
Puytorac 1972). Each genus has dozens of species and some of them have a complex taxonomic history
(see, Heidenreich 1935; Beers 1938; Williams 1942; Lom 1961; de Puytorac 1972). Most taxonomic
problems have arisen from the paucity of morphological differential features as well as from the lack
of information on intraspecies variability and host range. Host species very likely constitute clearly
isolated ecological niches that might permit speciation of symbiotic ciliates (Irwin & Lynn 2015; Irwin
et al. 2017; Vďačný 2018; Vďačný et al. 2018, 2019), although no distinct apomorphic morphological
features might be recognizable between astomes originated from different hosts. In this case, molecular
data could independently prove the species identity and could also help to statistically delimit species
boundaries (Abraham et al. 2019). Unfortunately, except for the study of Affa’a et al. (2004), molecular
data are completely missing from astome ciliates isolated from lumbricid earthworms, although there
are some reports from earthworms of the families Megascolecidae Rosa, 1891 and Glossoscolecidae
Michaelsen, 1900 (Fokam et al. 2011).
Therefore, in the present study, we apply an integrative approach to study astome ciliates inhabiting the
gastrointestinal tract of some lumbricid earthworms originated from Slovakia, Central Europe. Our main
goals are set as follows:
1. to study the diversity and phylogeny of astome ciliates inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of
lumbricid earthworms.
2. to test the host specificity of endosymbiotic ciliates to certain ecological groups of earthworms,
using 18S rRNA gene sequences.
3. to assess the morphological and genetic variability of astome ciliates isolated from lumbricid
earthworms.
Material and methods
Material collection and processing
Earthworms from the family Lumbricidae were sampled at seven localities in the capital of Bratislava
and in its vicinity, western Slovakia, Central Europe (Fig. 1; Table 1). Collected lumbricids were
transferred together with in situ substrates to the laboratory at the Department of Zoology, Comenius
University in Bratislava. Their identification was based on morphological characters and followed the
monograph of Pižl (2002). In total, four earthworm species were determined: Lumbricus terrestris
Linnaeus, 1758, Eisenia fetida (Savigny, 1826), Dendrobaena veneta (Rossa, 1886) and Octolasion
tyrtaeum (Savigny, 1826). After identification, earthworms were euthanized in formalin (37%) vapors,
their guts were dissected and their contents were extracted with a micropipette and observed under an
optical microscope Leica DM2500. Ciliate endosymbionts were manually isolated from the gut content

with the aid of Pasteur micropipettes adjusted as described by Foissner (2014). Living ciliates were
investigated at low (50–400´) and high (1000´, oil immersion) magnifications, using bright field and
differential interference contrast optics (Foissner 2014). Images were captured by a Canon EOS 70D
camera. Ciliates were measured from images, using the calibrated software ImageJ ver. 1.49 (Schneider
et al. 2012).
Multivariate taxonomic methods
A multivariate approach was used to investigate the morphometric variation and distinctness of four
astome species isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of earthworms. Altogether, 16 quantitative features,
a single qualitative character and two derived ratios were scored on 33 specimens. The libraries NumPy
(Oliphant 2015) and Pandas (McKinney 2010) were utilized to load and process the morphometric
matrix in Python ver. 3.6.6. The similarity of specimens was measured by Gower’s coefficient GOW
(Gower 1971):

OBERT T. & VĎAČNÝ P., Morphology and phylogeny of five astome ciliates
The similarity of specimens, as measured by Gower’s index, was assessed by metric multi-dimensional
scaling implemented in the scikit-learn package (Pedregosa et al. 2011). The SMACOF algorithm was
run with 250 initializations, each run had 20 000 iterations and ε was set to 10-8 to declare convergence.
Plotting of the ordination diagram was done with the Matplotlib module (Hunter 2007).
Molecular methods
Single cells were picked and washed in five drops of Ringer’s solution (0.6%). Thoroughly washed
specimens were stored in 180 µl of the cell lysis buffer CLD (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA)
at 6°C. Genomic DNA from single cells was extracted with the ReliaPrep™ Blood gDNA Miniprep
System (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA). The 18S rRNA gene was amplified with the universal
eukaryotic primers Euk A (5’-AAC CTG GTT GAT CCT GCC AGT-3’) and Euk B (5’-TGA TCC TTC
TGC AGG TTC AC-3’) (Medlin et al. 1988). Individual polymerase chain reactions (PCR) included
5 µl of the extracted template DNA, 0.4 µl of the forward and reverse primers each (10 pmol/µl) and
10 µl of the GoTaq® Long PCR Master Mix (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA). The final volume
was adjusted to 20 µl with deionized distilled water. PCR conditions were as follows: initial hot start
denaturation at 95°C for 15 min, 30 identical amplification cycles (denaturing at 95°C for 45 s, annealing
at 55°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 2.5 min) and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The quality
of the amplified DNA was checked by electrophoresing a 1% agarose gel. PCR products were purified
using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease I, E. coli (New England Biolabs® Inc.) and
sequenced on an ABI 3730 automatic sequencer (Macrogen, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Phylogenetic methods
Newly obtained sequences were examined in Chromas ver. 2.6.6 (Technelysium Pty Ltd.) and high-
quality sequence fragments were assembled into contigs in BioEdit ver. 7.2.5 (Hall 1999). Two
18S rRNA gene alignments were generated on the GUIDANCE2 server (http://guidance.tau.ac.il/ver2/),
with the MAFFT algorithm and 100 bootstrap repeats (Sela et al. 2015). The first alignment (referred
as ‘general’ henceforth) included 73 taxa and served to classify the newly obtained sequences into
oligohymenophorean subclasses. Representatives from all subclasses were selected to cover their
diversity and sampling basically followed our previous studies (Rataj & Vďačný 2018, 2019). Members
from the subclass Peniculia were used to a posteriori root the trees (Fokam et al. 2011). The second
alignment (referred as ‘detailed’ henceforth) contained 34 sequences from the oligohymenophorean
subclass Astomatia and two outgroup sequences of Dexiotricha Stokes, 1885 from the subclass
Scuticociliatia Small, 1967. Sampling in this dataset mostly followed Fokam et al. (2011) and Rataj &
Vďačný (2018, 2019) and served to more closely analyze the phylogenetic position of the new astome
isolates. To estimate the reliability of alignments, unmasked datasets and datasets masked with a cutoff
value of 0.93 were constructed.
The best evolutionary substitution models for all datasets were estimated and selected in jModelTest
ver. 2.1.10 under the Akaike Information Criterion (Darriba et al. 2012) on the Cipres portal ver. 3.1
(http://www.phylo.org/) (Miller et al. 2010). Phylogenetic relationships among oligohymenophorean
ciliates were reconstructed in the maximum likelihood, Bayesian and neighbor-joining framework under
the GTR +Γ + I evolutionary model with parameters as estimated in jModelTest. Maximum likelihood
analyses were performed in PhyML ver. 3.0 with the SPR swapping algorithm and 1000 non-parametric boot-
strap replicates on the South of France bioinformatics platform (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/)
(Guindon et al. 2010). Bayesian inferences were conducted on the Cipres portal ver. 3.1 in the program
MrBayes on XSEDE ver. 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. 2012). Prior parameters of the GTR +Γ + I evolutionary
model were implemented with the ‘lset’ and ‘prset’ commands in the MrBayes command block. Two
runs, each having four (one cold and three heated) simultaneous Markov chains, were five million
generations long. The sampling frequency was set to one hundred and the burn-in fraction was specified
as 25%. In addition, the second set of detailed alignments was also analyzed by the neighbor-joining
5

European Journal of Taxonomy 559: 1–37 (2019)
algorithm in MEGA X (Kumar et al. 2018). All trees were computed as unrooted and were rooted a
posteriori in FigTree ver. 1.2.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
Reliability of alternative tree topologies was assessed by the approximately unbiased, weighted
Shimodaira-Hasegawa and weighted Kishino-Hasegawa tests (Shimodaira & Hasegawa 2001;
Shimodaira 2002, 2008). Topologically unconstrained and constrained trees were constructed under
the GTR +Γ + I evolutionary model, using the heuristic search, random sequence addition and the SPR
swapping algorithm in the program PAUP* ver. 4.0b8 (Swofford 2003). Site-wise log likelihoods were
calculated for unconstrained and constrained trees and served to calculate p-values for the tree topology
tests in the program package CONSEL, using the commands makermt, consel and catpv (Shimodaira &
Hasegawa 2001).
Average evolutionary distances among the five species of astome ciliates isolated from lumbricid
earthworms, were calculated from their 18S rRNA gene alignment with the maximum composite
likelihood model in MEGA X (Kumar et al. 2018). Standard errors of between group evolutionary
distances were estimated with the bootstrap method and 1000 replicates. The rate variation among sites
was modeled with a gamma distribution and the differences in the composition bias among sequences
were considered in evolutionary comparisons (Tamura & Kumar 2002).

Results
Diversity of astome ciliates in the gastrointestinal tract of lumbricid earthworms
In total, 300 earthworms were investigated for astome ciliates: 150 specimens of Lumbricus terrestris,
120 individuals of Eisenia fetida, 25 exemplars of Dendrobaena veneta and five specimens of Octolasion
tyrtaeum. Five species of endosymbiotic astome ciliates were isolated from their gastrointestinal tract:
Metaradiophrya lumbrici, M. varians, Anoplophrya lumbrici, A. vulgaris and A. cf. nodulata (Table 2).
Occurrence and abundance of astome ciliates were highly variable. Immature earthworms typically did
not contain any ciliates, only bacterial clumps and sometimes nematodes. About one half of mature
earthworms exhibiting a clitellum was inhabited by 10 to 50 ciliates per oligochaete. Sometimes, a
mass occurrence of M. lumbrici was recorded in earthworms longer than 15 cm. Endosymbionts were
typically found in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract.

The body size is about 105‒230 × 55‒130 µm, with an average of 170 × 100 µm. The shape is ovate to
elliptical with an anterior body end rounded and posterior end broadly rounded to truncate. The cell is
distinctly dorsoventrally flattened (Figs 2A, F, 3B, F‒M, 4A–B, E–F). On the ventral side, about 10 µm
away from the anterior body end, there is a conspicuous fibrillar hook composed of two unequally long
arms. The longer arm is 25‒35 µm long, flat and completely situated underneath the cell surface. The
shorter arm is 8‒13 µm long, usually appears slightly more robust at the base and projects from the cell

in lateral view. A set of very distinct fibers is associated with the hook: on average 6 (5‒7) fibers are
attached to the upper right side of the longer arm, on average 33 (30‒37) fibers to the ventral side of the
longer arm and on average 11 (8‒13) fibers to the left side of the shorter arm (Figs 2A‒C, 3A, 5).
The nuclear apparatus is composed of a macronucleus and a micronucleus. The macronucleus is rod-
like with both ends rounded. It begins about 27 µm away from the anterior body margin and ends about
12 µm above the posterior body margin. Its length spans a range from approximately 85 to 200 µm and its
width ranges from 8 to 18 µm, averaging at 13 µm. The macronuclear surface is smooth and without any
irregularities, however, small vesicules appear in its vicinity in dying cells. The micronucleus is typically
situated close to the mid-portion of the macronucleus. The shape of micronucleus is circular to elliptical
and its diameter is approximately 7 µm. The central region of micronucleus appears homogenous and
brighter than its margin in the differential interference optics and might represent a central nucleolus
(Figs 2F–G, 3B‒M, 4A, C–D).
There are invariably two staggered rows of contractile vacuoles, extending right and left of the
macronucleus. Their number ranges from 3 to 12 with an average of 6 vacuoles in the right row and from
3 to 11 with an average of 6 vacuoles in the left row (Figs 2A, F–G, 3B, F‒M, 4B‒D). The cytoplasm is
colorless and contains innumerable granules being ca 0.4 µm across and rod-like bacteria being about
3‒15 µm long (Figs 2G, 4C–D). The cortex is rigid and without any specific granules (Fig. 5). Swims
moderately fast by rotation about the main body axis.
Somatic ciliature is holotrichous and composed of very densely ciliated and narrowly spaced kineties.
The ventral ciliature is interrupted by a subapical suture that extends from the right body margin over the
fibrillar hook towards the left body margin. Somatic kineties above the suture run towards the anterior
body end where they curve onto the dorsal body side to meridionally extend over its surface towards the
posterior body end. Somatic kineties below the suture run meridionally over the ventral side towards the
posterior body end (Figs 2A–B, 3A, 4E–F, 5). The number of kineties on each body side ranges from 60
to 78. Lateral kineties form a right and a left subterminal suture in the posterior body region (Figs 2D–E,
4E).
Occurrence
Metaradiophrya lumbrici was detected exclusively in a group of anecic earthworms, namely, in
L. terrestris at three localities: in gardens in the Šúrska ulica street in Rendez and in the Jakubská
ulica street in Rača as well as in floodplain soils in a riparian, willow-poplar forest near the Karlova
Ves branch of the Danube River (Table 2). Ciliates were typically isolated from the middle part of the
gastrointestinal tract, although very rarely one or two specimens were recorded also slightly above and
below this gut region.
Metaradiophrya varians (de Puytorac, 1954)
Figs 6, 7
Description
The body size is about 110‒180 × 85‒95 µm. The body shape is ovate to elliptical with an anterior body
end rounded and posterior end broadly rounded to truncate. The cell is distinctly dorsoventrally flattened
(Figs 6A, F‒I, 7A, D). The fibrillar hook is localized about 10 µm away from the anterior body end. Its
longer arm measures on average 30 µm, while its shorter arm only 11 µm. The hook appears slightly
flatter than in the previous species and the thickened base of the shorter arm has been never observed.
There are 5 or 6 fibers attached to the upper right side of the longer arm, on average 26 (22‒29) fibers to
the ventral side of the longer arm and 11 or 12 fibers to the left side of the shorter arm (Figs 6A‒C, 7B).

OBERT T. & VĎAČNÝ P., Morphology and phylogeny of five astome ciliates
The nuclear apparatus consists of a single macronucleus and a single micronucleus. The macronucleus
commences on average 25 µm away from the anterior body end and terminates on average 11 µm away
from the posterior body end. The size of macronucleus is about 80‒140 × 10‒15 µm. The macronucleus
extends through cell’s midline. The micronucleus reaches a diameter of 6‒8 µm and is situated close to
the macronucleus about in its mid-portion (Figs 6D‒I, 7A, D).
There are two staggered rows of contractile vacuoles arranged along the right and left side of the
macronucleus: 5‒8 vacuoles in the right row and 6 or 7 vacuoles in the left row (Figs 6A, E‒I, 7A, D).
The cytoplasm is colorless and studded with granules about 0.5 µm across. The cortex is rigid and
without granules (Fig. 7B). Swims moderately fast by rotation about the main body axis.
Somatic ciliature is holotrichous and composed of very densely ciliated and narrowly spaced kineties.
The ventral ciliature is interrupted by a subapical suture extending from the right body margin over the
fibrillar hook to the left body margin. Somatic kineties above the suture run towards the anterior body
end where they curve onto the dorsal body side to meridionally extend over its surface towards the
posterior body end. Somatic kineties below the suture run meridionally over the ventral side towards
the posterior body end (Figs 6A–B, 7B–C). The number of ventral kineties ranges from 50 to 64 on the
ventral side and from 53 to 64 on the dorsal side. There is a subterminal suture on the left and the right
side of the body.
Occurrence
Metaradiophrya varians was solely recorded in the epigeic E. fetida at two comparatively distant
localities, i.e., in compost heaps in the Jakubská ulica street in Rača and in the Botanical Garden of
Comenius University (Fig. 1; Table 2). Metaradiophrya varians inhabited only the middle part of the
gastrointestinal tract and there were usually ten exemplars per earthworm. Our data on occurrence of
M. varians and M. lumbrici indicate that both species are specialized on different ecological groups of
host oligochaetes. The ecologically different L. terrestris and E. fetida never contained the same species
of Metaradiophrya, even when they originated from closely situated localities or when they were co-
cultivated in the laboratory.

Genus Anoplophrya Stein, 1860
Anoplophrya lumbrici (Schrank, 1803)
Figs 8, 9
Description
The body size is about 50‒120 × 35‒100 µm, with an average of 90 × 60 µm. The shape is broadly
elliptical to elliptical with both ends rounded. The cell is distinctly dorsoventrally flattened (Figs 8A,
E‒I, 9A–B, D).
The nuclear apparatus consists of a single macronucleus and a single micronucleus. The macronucleus
begins about 11 µm away from the anterior body end and extends through the cell’s midline. The size
of macronucleus varies from about 30‒95 × 5‒15 µm, with an average of 72 × 9 µm. The macronuclear
surface is smooth to slightly irregular. In dying cells, the macronucleus diminishes in size leaving behind
a conspicuous hyaline envelope. The macronucleus sometimes also fragments within the envelope in
postmortem cells. The micronucleus is situated conspicuously far away from the macronucleus, namely,
near the middle of the left body margin and always opposite to the row of contractile vacuoles. The
micronucleus is globular and approximately 5 µm in diameter (Figs 8A, D‒I, 9A‒D).

There is only a single row of contractile vacuoles extending along the right cell margin. The number
of vacuoles is three or four and their size ranges from 4 to 11 µm in diastole. A contractile vacuole
originates by fusion of three to five vesicules (Figs 8A, E–F, H–I, 9A–B, D). The cytoplasm is colorless
and contains innumerable granules being about 1.5 µm across. The cortex is semi-rigid and without
specific granules. Swims moderately fast by rotation about the main body axis.
The somatic ciliature is holotrichous and composed of meridionally extending kineties over both cell
sides. The number of ventral kineties varies from 30 to 50, averaging at 42. The number of dorsal
kineties almost matches the number on the ventral side (30‒51, on average 43). Somatic kineties are
composed of very densely arranged basal bodies, i.e., intrakinetal distance is only 1.3 µm (Figs 8A, 9B).
There is an apical and a terminal suture at the anterior and the posterior pole where individual somatic
kineties begin and terminate, respectively (Figs 8B–C, 9E).
Occurrence
Anoplophrya lumbrici was recorded only in the anecic L. terrestris at three localities: gardens at the
Šúrska ulica street in Rendez and at the Jakubská ulica street in Rača as well as in floodplain soils in
a riparian, willow-poplar forest near the Karlova Ves branch of the Danube River (Table 2). Ciliates
were typically isolated from the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract, although very rarely some
specimens were recorded also below this gut region.
Anoplophrya vulgaris de Puytorac, 1954
Figs 10, 11A‒C
Description
The body size is about 100‒145 × 60‒80 µm. The body shape is broadly elliptical to elliptical with both
ends rounded. The cell is distinctly dorsoventrally flattened (Figs 10A, D‒F, 11A–B).
The nuclear apparatus is composed of a single macronucleus and a single micronucleus. The macronucleus
begins about 6 µm away from the anterior body end extends through the cell’s midline into the posterior
body region. The length of macronucleus varies from 80 to 110 µm and its width ranges from 9 to
18 µm. The macronuclear surface is smooth. The macronucleus diminishes in size leaving behind a
conspicuous hyaline envelope in dying cells. The micronucleus is situated conspicuously far away from
the macronucleus, namely, near the middle of the left body margin and opposite to the row of contractile
vacuoles. The micronucleus is globular and approximately 4 µm in diameter (Figs 10A, D‒F, 11A–B).
There is a single row of contractile vacuoles arranged along the right cell margin. It is composed of
three or four vacuoles being 5‒9 µm across during diastole (Figs 10A, D‒F, 11A–B). The cytoplasm
is colorless and studded with granules measuring approximately 0.5‒1.0 µm in diameter. The cortex is
semi-rigid and without specific granules. Swims moderately fast by rotation about the main body axis.
Somatic ciliature is holotrichous and composed of kineties meridionally extending over both cell sides.
There are on average 34 (24‒45) kineties on each body side. Individual kineties are very narrowly
arranged and the interkinetal distance ranges from about 0.6 to 2.0 µm. Likewise, basal bodies are
very narrowly spaced within kineties and the intrakinetal distance is ca 1 µm. There is an apical and a
terminal suture at each cell pole where individual somatic kineties commence and terminate, respectively
(Figs 10A‒C, 11B–C).

Occurrence
Anoplophrya vulgaris was recorded in two species of epigeic earthworms, viz., in E. fetida and D. veneta.
Ciliate 18S rRNA gene sequences originated from both hosts were identical. Host earthworms came
from a compost heap in the Botanical Garden of Comenius University and at the Jakubská ulica street
in Rača as well as from humous soil with a high content of decomposing plant material from a garden at
the foothill of the Malé Karpaty Mts. (Table 2). Endosymbiotic ciliates typically occurred in the middle
part of the gastrointestinal tract. There were usually 10 to 15 endosymbionts per host.

Description
Only five specimens were found, three were morphologically examined and two were used for molecular
analyses. Therefore, the description is rather incomplete. The body size is about 100 × 50 µm. The

shape is ovate to broadly fusiform with both ends rounded. The cell is distinctly dorsoventrally flattened
(Figs 11D–E, 12).
The macronucleus begins about 10 µm away from the anterior body end and extends through the
cell’s midline. Its size is usually 75 × 13 µm. The macronuclear surface was slightly irregular. The
macronucleus displays similar postmortem changes as in the two previous Anoplophrya species, i.e.,
it slightly diminishes in size leaving behind a hyaline envelope. The micronucleus was not observed
(Figs 11D–E, 12).
There are two staggered rows of contractile vacuoles extending along the right and left side of the
macronucleus: 3‒6 vacuoles in the right row and 3‒5 vacuoles in the left row. The average size of
vacuoles ranged from 5‒7 µm during diastole (Figs 11D–E, 12). The cytoplasm is colorless and filled
with granules being approximately 1 µm in diameter. The cortex is semi-rigid and without specific
granules. Swims moderately fast by rotation about the main body axis.

Somatic ciliature is holotrichous and composed of densely ciliated meridional kineties. Due to the low
number of ciliates, their number on the ventral and dorsal side could not be determined.
Occurrence
Anoplophrya nodulata was detected only in two out of five specimens of Octolasion tyrtaeum
investigated. This endogeic earthworm originated from the upper 50 cm peat layer in the riparian zone
of the Rašelinisko Pond in the vicinity of the Pusté Úľany Village in the Galanta District (Table 2).
Endosymbiotic ciliates were found only in the central part of the oligochaete gastrointestinal tract. No
other ciliates were recorded in the digestive system of O. tyrtaeum.
Multivariate morphometric analyses
Altogether, 16 quantitative features, a single qualitative character and two derived ratios were scored on
33 individuals belonging to four astome species: M. lumbrici, M. varians, A. lumbrici and A. vulgaris.
Morphometric data were compiled in Table 3 and served to calculate Gower’s pairwise similarities
among ciliate specimens. Multidimensional scaling was performed on the pairwise Gower’s coefficients,
using the scikit-learn package in Python.

Two mutually isolated groups, species of Metaradiophrya and Anoplophrya, were distinctly separated
along the first and the second ordination axis (Fig. 13). However, individual species within each genus
were not distinctly segregated. Specifically, two specimens of M. varians were intermingled with some
M. lumbrici individuals, indicating that the intraspecific variability in most morphometric features of the
latter species is so wide that M. varians at least partially falls within its range. Nevertheless, both species
can be unequivocally distinguished by a single morphometric character, the number of fibers associated
with the ventral side of the longer arm of the fibrillar hook. Specifically, there are 30‒37 (on average 33)
fibers in M. lumbrici and 22‒29 (on average 26) fibers in M. varians (Table 3).

OBERT T. & VĎAČNÝ P., Morphology and phylogeny of five astome ciliates
A similar mixed pattern was revealed also for the two species of Anoplophrya. Anoplophrya lumbrici
was depicted as a comparatively more variable species, somewhat overlapping with the cluster of
A. vulgaris. The latter species, however, showed a trend of at least partial separation from A. lumbrici in
the ordination diagram (Fig. 13). The morphometric data indicate that A. vulgaris is slightly larger and
narrower than A. lumbrici (100‒145 × 60‒80 µm vs 50‒120 × 35‒100 µm), although their size ranges
overlap distinctly.
Molecular characterization and phylogenetic position of ciliates isolated from
lumbricid earthworms
In total, 19 new 18S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from M. lumbrici (eight sequences),
M. varians (four sequences), A. lumbrici (two sequences), A. vulgaris (three sequences) and A. nodulata
(two sequences). Their length, GC content and GenBank accession numbers are summarized in Table 4.
Intraspecies sequence similarities were 100%, except for M. lumbrici where one out of the 1762
nucleotide positions was polymorphic. Namely, two KR-specimens (10/1 and 10/C) had guanine at
the position 796 while the rest of KR-exemplars as well as all other M. lumbrici individuals displayed
adenine there.
Genetic distances estimated under the maximum composite likelihood model showed that the evolution-
ary divergence between M. lumbrici and M. varians is 0.0138 ± 0.0032. A slightly larger distance was
revealed between A. lumbrici and A. vulgaris (0.0168 ± 0.0037). However, evolutionary divergences
between species of Metaradiophrya and Anoplophrya were more than two times greater ranging from
0.0304 to 0.0380. Anoplophrya nodulata was revealed as the most divergent taxon from both species of
Metaradiophrya (0.0608‒0.0627) as well as from the two other species of Anoplophrya (0.0717‒0.0752)
(Table 5).
To determine the phylogenetic position of these five ciliate species, Bayesian and maximum likelihood
(ML) as well as neighbor-joining (NJ) analyses were conducted (Figs 14–15). The newly obtained
sequences were classified into the paraphyletic subclass Astomatia of the class Oligohymenophorea.
Paraphyly of the Astomatia was caused in that the astome Haptophrya planariarum (von Siebold, 1839)
isolated from flatworms clustered with species of the scuticociliate genus Dexiotricha with full statistical
support both in the Bayesian and ML analyses. All astomes isolated from annelids formed a strongly
statistically supported monophylum (posterior probability 1.00, 99% ML bootstrap). Astomes from
polychaetes (Durchoniella spp.) branched off first and were followed by a paraphyletic assemblage of
astomes from endogeic oligochaetes (Almophrya de Puytorac et Dragesco, 1969, Anoplophrya nodulata,
Eudrilophrya de Puytorac, 1969, Metaracoelophrya de Puytorac et Dragesco, 1969, Njinella Ngassam,
1983 and Paraclausilocola Fokam et al., 2011). Lineages of astome ciliates from anecic (M. lumbrici
and A. lumbrici) and epigeic (M. varians and A. vulgaris) earthworms were nested within the crown
radiation of this paraphyletic cluster (Figs 14–15).
Monophylies of M. varians, A. lumbrici (including A. marylandensis Conklin, 1930), A. vulgaris and
A. nodulata were fully statistically supported in Bayesian, ML and NJ analyses of the general and
detailed alignment (Figs 14–15). However, monophyly of M. lumbrici was fully statistically supported
only in NJ analyses (100% bootstrap) of the detailed alignment (Fig. 15) and strongly in ML analyses
(91% bootstrap) of the general alignment (Fig. 14), while it was left unsupported in ML analyses of
the detailed alignment and in the Bayesian inferences of both alignments. Specifically, specimens of
M. lumbrici clustered together in Bayesian analyses of the general alignment, but with a statistically
insignificant posterior probability of 0.91 (Fig. 14). On the other hand, in the Bayesian tree inferred
from the detailed alignment, specimens of M. lumbrici were placed in a basal polytomy of a cluster
containing a fully statistically supported clade of A. lumbrici and A. vulgaris. This whole assemblage,
however, obtained a statistically insignificant posterior probability of 0.82 (Fig. 14) and its relevance

should be therefore taken with great caution. Identical topology was revealed also in ML analyses
of the detailed alignment (–ln L = 5056.68) (data not shown). Due to the discrepancy between the
topology of the NJ tree on the one hand and the Bayesian and ML trees on the other, statistical tree
topology tests were conducted. They revealed that the monophyly of M. lumbrici and its sister-group
relationship to M. varians (–ln L = 5059.33) could not be rejected (Table 6). The conflict between the
distance NJ tree and the Bayesian and ML trees was possibly caused by a plesiomorphic/homoplastic
trap. Meteradiophrya lumbrici differed from M. varians in 25 nucleotide positions, but a comparison
of 18S rRNA gene sequences of M. lumbrici with those of three species of Anoplophrya revealed that
19 out of the 25 variable nucleotide positions are either plesiomorphies or possibly homoplasies. Only
six positions (36, 76, 100, 119, 120, 141) appear as molecular apomorphies of M. lumbrici (Fig. 16).
This indicates that distance techniques might avoid the plesiomorphic/homoplastic trap when sequences
of related species are highly similar (genetic distance between M. lumbrici and M. varians is only
0.0138 ± 0.0032; Table 5). On the other hand, Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood might not
be resistant to the plesiomorphic/homoplastic trap when plesiomorphies/homoplasies significantly
28

OBERT T. & VĎAČNÝ P., Morphology and phylogeny of five astome ciliates
outnumber apomorphies. Therefore, taxonomic discrepancies in phylogenetic trees need to be analyzed
also using distance methods and statistical tree topology tests.
Discussion
The gastrointestinal tract of earthworms from the oligochaete family Lumbricidae is inhabited by
astomes belonging to only three genera, namely, Metaradiophrya, Anoplophrya and Maupasella
(Heidenreich 1935; Lom 1961; de Puytorac 1972). There are several dozens of species in each genus
and their identification is difficult because of comparatively few diagnostic morphologic features and
lack of information about intraspecific variability and host range (e.g., Cépède 1910; Heidenreich 1935;
Beers 1938; Williams 1942; Lom 1961; de Puytorac 1972). Because of these problems, most records
of astome ciliates from lumbricid earthworms need to be taken with caution. Moreover, our integrative
approach revealed that a combination of detailed microscopic observation, molecular data as well as
identity and ecological group of host organisms is indispensable for reliable identification of astomes.

lumbricid earthworms. Boxes mark 25 nucleotide positions in which M. lumbrici (Dujardin, 1841) differs
from M. varians (de Puytorac, 1954). The comparison with three outgroup species of Anoplophrya Stein,
1860 indicates that 19 out of the 25 variable nucleotide positions of M. lumrici are either plesiomorphies
or possibly homoplasies.

Based on the integrative taxonomic approach, two species of Metaradiophrya were isolated from
the lumbricid earthworms during the course of the present study: M. lumbrici and M. varians. The
former species was detected exclusively in the group of anecic earthworms. However, Heidenreich
(1935) also reported M. lumbrici from an ecologically different group of earthworms, namely, from
the epigeic L. rubellus Hoffmeister, 1843 and E. fetida (for problems with ciliate identity, see below).
Apart from L. terrestris, Lom (1961) recorded M. lumbrici also in Dendrobaena illyrica (Cognetti,
1906). De Puytorac (1972) extended the host spectrum of M. lumbrici by a further species from the
family Lumbricidae, namely, L. herculeus (Savigny, 1826). On the other hand, Williams (1942) did
not report M. lumbrici from the gastrointestinal tract of L. terrestris at all but from “Eisenia foetidus”.
Metaradiophrya varians has so far been reported exclusively from E. fetida (de Pyutorac 1954,
1972; Lom 1961; Paisán et al. 2009; present study). As evidenced by molecular data, we have never
recorded M. lumbrici in E. fetida. All sequences of Metaradiophrya from this epigeic earthworm were
100% identical. According to morphometric data, they belong to M. varians which has a lower number
of fibres associated with the ventral side of the longer arm of the hook than M. lumbrici (see above and
de Pyutorac 1954, 1972; Lom 1961; Paisán et al. 2009). Therefore, we assume that Heidenreich (1935)
and Williams (1942) misidentified M. varians as M. lumbrici.
According to the compendium of de Puytorac (1972), eight further species of Metaradiophrya were
reported from earthworms of the family Lumbricidae: (1) M. asymmetrica (Beers, 1938) from “Eisenia
lönnbergi (Michlsn, 1844)” [= Eisenoides lonnbergi (Michaelsen, 1894)]; (2) M. bifulta (de Puytorac, 1954)
from Helodrilus schneideri Michaelsen, 1900; (3) M. chlorotica (Williams, 1942) from Allolobophora
chlorotica (Savigny, 1826); (4) M. falcifera (Stein, 1861) from L. rubellus, Nicodrilus caliginosus
[= Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny, 1826)] and Octolasion lacteum (Örley, 1881); (5) M. gardneri
(Rees, 1961) from Eisenia fetida; (6) M. gigas de Puytorac, 1954 from Aporrectodea savignyi [=
Scherotheca savignyi (Guerne & Horst, 1893)]; (7) M. heidenreichi (de Puytorac, 1954) from Helodrilus
schneideri; and (8) M. hovassei (de Puytorac, 1954) from Allolobophora chlorotica and Eisenia rosea
(Savigny, 1826).
In the course of the present study, three species of Anoplophrya were reported from the lumbricid
earthworms: A. lumbrici, A. vulgaris and A. nodulata. We detected A. lumbrici exclusively in the anecic
L. terrestris. Similarly, Heidenreich (1935) and de Puytorac (1972) mentioned L. terrestris as the host
of A. lumbrici. Lom (1961), in addition, reported A. lumbrici from the epigeic earthworms L. rubellus
and D. subrubicunda [= Dendrodrilus rubidus subrubicundus (Eisen, 1874)] in which, however,
exemplars of A. lumbrici exhibited conspicuous morphological differences. This indicates that they
might represent different species of Anoplophrya. Heidenreich (1935) considered A. marylandensis
to be a junior synonym of A. lumbrici, which is also indicated by the present phylogenetic analyses
(Figs 14–15). Sequences of A. marylandensis and A. lumbrici, originating from the same host organisms
(L. terrestris), clustered together in our phylogenetic analyses and had a 99.3% identity. However, we
cannot exclude that the difference of 0.7% in the 18S rRNA gene is sufficient to separate A. marylandensis

from A. lumbrici. For instance, two species of Paraclausilocola are morphologically clearly distinct but
are only 0.3% divergent in their 18S rRNA gene sequences. Therefore, at the present state of knowledge,
it might be premature to synonymize A. marylandensis with A. lumbrici. Conklin (1930) discovered
A. marylandensis in L. terrestris and Helodrilus caliginosus [= Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny, 1826)].
Lom (1961) considered A. marylandensis as a valid species and recorded it rarely in Allolobophora
longa [= Aporrectodea longa (Ude, 1885)] and Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny, 1826). However, Lom
(1961) did not list these two species in his comprehensive table but provided there two completely
different earthworm species, Octolasium lacteum [= Octolasion lacteum] and Allolobophora caliginosa
[= Aporrectodea caliginosa]. Due to the conflicts between text and tables, it is not possible to state
where Lom (1961) detected A. marylandensis.
Heidenreich (1935) also considered A. alluri Cépède, 1910, A. lloydii Ghosh, 1918 and A. striata
(Dujardin, 1841) as junior synonyms of A. lumbrici. In addition, he also found A. striata as synonyms of
A. alluri and A. nodulata. According to Lom (1961), A. alluri is also a junior synonym of A. nodulata.
Whether the two latter species are conspecific and also identical with A. simplex Nana et al., 2018 is
difficult to decide at the present state of knowledge. However, synonymization of A. alluri and A. nodulata
with A. lumbrici is not justified in the light of both morphological (two rows of contractile vacuoles vs
a single row of vacuoles) and molecular (Figs 14–15) data. Cépède (1910) discovered Anoplophrya
alluri in Allurus tetraedrus [= Eiseniella tetraedra (Savigny, 1826)], but he provided a much wider host
spectrum for A. striata: L. rubellus, L. terrestris, L. variegatus [= Lumbriculus variegatus (Müller, 1774)],
E. foetida and Al. chlorotica. According to Ghosh (1918), A. lloydii originated from Pheretima posthuma
[= Perichaeta posthuma Vaillant, 1868] which, however, does not belong to the family Lumbricidae but
to the Megascolecidae. Anoplophrya simplex was isolated from Alma emini (Michaelsen, 1892) which
belongs to the Glossoscolecidae (Nana et al. 2018). Therefore, conspecificity of A. alluri, A. lloydii and
A. simplex is unlikely, although all three species display two rows of contractile vacuoles.
We detected A. vulgaris exclusively from the epigeic earthworms E. fetida and D. veneta. Ciliate
18S rRNA gene sequences obtained from both hosts were identical. Similarly, de Puytorac (1954,
1972), Lom (1961) and Paisán et al. (2009) reported A. vulgaris from epigeic earthworms. The third
detected species of Anoplophrya in the present study was identified as A. nodulata. Heidenreich (1935)
considered it incorrectly as a junior synonym of A. lumbrici (see above). Dujardin (1841) did not specify
the host organism in which he discovered A. nodulata. We have detected it exclusively in a single
endogeic species, O. tyrtaeum. Lom (1961) frequently recorded A. nodulata in E. tetraedra and rarely
in A. caliginosa. Because of quite different host species, the conspecificity of our and Lom’s (1961)
populations is questionable and needs to be tested by molecular data.
31

European Journal of Taxonomy 559: 1–37 (2019)
According to the compendium of de Puytorac (1972), seven further species of Anoplophrya were
reported from earthworms of the family Lumbricidae: (1) Anoplophrya commune de Puytorac, 1954
from Allolobophora savignyi [= Scherotheca savignyi]; (2) Anoplophrya enigmatica (authorship
not provided by de Puytorac 1972) from Dendrobaena subrubicunda [= Dendrodrilus rubidus
subrubicundus]; (3) Anoplophrya oblonga de Puytorac, 1954 from L. herculeus and L. terrestris; (4)
Anoplophrya problematica (authorship not provided by de Puytorac 1972) from Dendrobaena illyrica;
(5) Anoplophrya singularis de Puytorac, 1954 from L. festivus (Savigny, 1826); (6) Anoplophrya
suspicata (authorship not provided by de Puytorac 1972) from L. castaneus (Savigny, 1826); and (7)
Anoplophrya tchadovi de Puytorac, 1958 from “Eiseniella ohridana Cern” [= E. tetraedra var. ochridana
Černosvitov, 1931].
The present phylogenetic analyses did not support monophylies of the genera Metaracoelophrya,
Metaradiophrya and Anoplophrya (Figs 14–15). Monophyly of Metaracoelophrya was also firmly refuted
by all statistical tree topology tests (Table 6). To solve this taxonomic problem, details on morphology
of the three species of Metaracoelophrya are needed. Likewise, monophyly of M. lumbrici, M. varians
and Metaradiophrya sp. HQ446279 was consistently rejected, although monophyly of M. lumbrici
and M. varians could not be excluded by any statistical test (Table 6). However, examination of the
dissertation thesis of Fokam (2012) revealed that Metaradiophrya sp. HQ446279 (= “Metaradiophrya
simplex” in his thesis) is obviously not a Metaradiophrya, since it does not possess a fibrillar hook
composed of two unequally long arms. Finally, polyphyly of the genus Anoplophrya is caused in that
A. nodulata clusters far away from the A. lumbrici + A. marylandensis + A. vulgaris clade. As mentioned
above, the genetic divergence of A. nodulata and the two other species of Anoplophrya is comparatively
big (0.0717‒0.0752) and even greater than from the two species of Metaradiophrya (0.0608‒0.0627).
Since A. nodulata is distinguished from the two other species of Anoplophrya by the contractile vacuole
pattern (two rows vs one row) and by the ecological group of host earthworms (endogeic vs anecic or
epigeic), it should be transferred to a distinct genus. However, due to the lack of detailed morphological
data on A. nodulata, we prefer not to establish a new genus in the present study.
It is important to emphasize that all literature data on occurrence of astome ciliates in the digestive tract
of oligochaetes from the family Lumbricidae are problematic due to taxonomic difficulties and lack
of molecular data. Our integrative approach revealed that reliable identification of astome ciliates also
requires molecular data. Moreover, our phylogenetic analyses also suggest that astome ciliates might be
associated with certain ecological and systematic groups of their host organisms. Therefore, occurrence
of individual astome species in ecologically different and phylogenetically distant earthworms seems to
be unlikely and needs to be corroborated by molecular data.
