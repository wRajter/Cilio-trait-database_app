Abstract
A taxonomic and nomenclatural revision of Sladecek's et al. (1981) and Wegl's (1983) lists of ciliates (Protozoa:
Ciliophora) as indicators of water quality has been performed. The original reference, important synonyms,
and modern taxonomic literature are provided for each of the 378 taxa recognized . The results of this revision
are summarized in a table which shows the correct (modern) name, author, and date of publication of each
species as well as its saprobity, its saprobic valency, its indicative weight, and its saprobic index .
1. Introduction One might think that it is not very important if the
