Ciliates are unicellular heterotrophic organisms that play a key role in aquatic planktonic and benthic
food webs. Advances in sedimentary DNA (sed‑DNA) analysis offer the possibility to integrate
these bioindicators in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. In this study, we used the top–bottom
paleolimnological approach and metabarcoding techniques applied to sed‑DNA to compare the
recent and past (i.e. prior to major anthropogenic impacts) ciliate communities of 48 lakes located
along an elevation gradient. Our results show an overall decline in the β‑diversity in recent time,
especially in lowland lakes, which are more strongly exposed to local human pressures. Analyses of the
functional groups indicate important restructuration of the food web, including the recent increase in
mixotrophs. Moreover, changes in the benthic ciliates were consistent with the widespread increase in
deep water anoxia. Our results provided evidence that sed‑DNA can uncover information about past
ciliate communities on a wide variety of lakes. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of using
ciliates as new paleoindicators, integrating information from the pelagic to the benthic zones, and
providing valuable insights into ecosystem functioning through a trait‑based functional community
approach. As paleoindicator, they thus offer a more holistic view on the long‑term changes of aquatic
ecosystems.
Lakes are largely recognized as integrators and sentinels of environmental changes1. Pressures from anthropo-
genic activities have largely increased in magnitude since the mid-twentieth century, a period that has also been
referred to as the Great Acceleration2,3. More specifically, climate change and the human alteration of the land-
scapes can have a profound impact on the physical and chemical characteristics of l akes4,5, thereby influencing the
communities living in and depending on these e cosystems6. While challenging, assessing the biological response
to environmental changes over large geographical scales can provide important insight into the vulnerability of
lakes to anthropogenic and climate forcing. The top–bottom paleolimnological approach allows such assessment
for aquatic communities through the comparison of sedimentary archives of recent (i.e. top samples) and past
communities (i.e. bottom sample)7. This comparative approach is quite powerful as it can be applied on large
geographical scales and brings important insight into reference conditions (i.e. prior to major anthropogenic
influences), thereby providing an assessment of the amplitude of change8,9
Although the diagenesis and archiving of DNA in sediments through time is often discussed in literature10,
previous studies have demonstrated that the genetic information of the microorganisms living in the water col-
umn is archived in the sediments11–13. Over the last decades, the development of molecular biology techniques
to target DNA molecules preserved in lake sediments (sed-DNA) largely expanded the field of p aleolimnology14.
Applying molecular biology tools in paleolimnological investigations have allowed to reconstruct historical
freshwater b iodiversity15. Through the implementation of new paleo-indicators, sed-DNA provides access to
information about the long-term dynamic of organisms for which morphological remains are not preserved16,17,
as well as overlooked communities. This includes microorganisms18,19, which represent the largest source of

biodiversity and ecological functions. As such, sed-DNA offers new opportunities to reconstruct a more holistic
view of the long-term biological dynamic of lakes18,20 and integrate microorganisms in the debates concerning
the response of biodiversity to ongoing environmental changes19.
Ciliates are unicellular microorganisms occupying diverse ecological niches and are widely distributed21.
These protists display a large functional diversity, acting as predators of bacteria and other protists, including
algae, as well as small metazoans22, while mixotrophic ciliates can significantly enhance primary production23,24.
Altogether, they play a key role in aquatic pelagic and benthic food webs, especially in the transfer of energy and
nutrient cycling from the microbial loop to the metazooplankton21,25. Long-term reconstruction of the microbial
eukaryote diversity of large peri-alpine lakes reported a strong relative contribution of the ciliate communities
to the total abundance of microeukaryotic communities13. These studies also demonstrated that ciliates are
sensitive to changes in phosphorus concentration. Although the ciliates are good indicators of environmental
changes25,26, they are seldom used in routine limnological surveys. Indeed, the analysis of ciliate communities
through microscopic-based approach and morphospecies identifications is challenging27, mostly because the
monophyletic group of ciliates includes very different organisms that display diverse and complex life cycles28.
Recent advances in molecular biology and the development of more robust taxonomic libraries continue to
strengthen eDNA and sed-DNA techniques28,29, thereby allowing to include these understudied groups and
useful indicators for a more holistic ecological diagnosis.
In the present study, we combine metabarcoding methods and the top–bottom paleolimnological approach
to reconstruct recent and past ciliate communities of 48 temperate lakes (Fig. 1). Drastic changes in the

composition of the microeukaryotic communities of these lakes were previously observed as a response to the
Great A cceleration18. More specifically, a significant increase in phototrophic and mixotrophic communities
was recorded, which was consistent with the global enhancement of primary productivity. Focusing on these
same lakes, we aimed at exploring how the heterotrophic and mixotrophic groups of ciliates responded to these
recent changes by (1) assessing the amplitude of changes in the ciliate communities across a wide variety of lakes
and (2) evaluating the potential of using the ciliate as indicators of functional and biological changes in paleo-
environmental reconstructions.
Results
Ciliates metabarcoding analyses. The sequencing resulted in a total number of 2,746,319 DNA reads
with an average of 28,650 reads per sample. After the filtering steps, 1,745,532 reads were retained and clustered
into 2446 OTUs. Detailed information about the effect of bioinformatics treatments on the DNA reads are acces-
sible in the supplementary information along with a summary of the resulting total number of OTU and number
of reads taxonomically assigned and associated to a functional trait (Supplemental Tables S1, S2).
Ciliates community diversity. The NMDS based on the Bray–Curtis distance (i.e. a measure of the ampli-
tude of change in the β-diversity of the ciliates at the community level between the past and recent samples)
showed that the overall dispersion of the recent samples (i.e. top of the core, corresponding to recent time ~ 2000
C.E.) and past samples (i.e. bottom samples of the core, corresponding to pre-industrial time prior to the 1850s)
differed, with the distance between the samples and their geometric median being much more variable and
greater for the bottom samples (Fig. 2).
The average distance between the samples and their geometric median was significantly different between
the past 0.79 and recent samples 0.35 (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.01). However, there was no large displacement of the
geometric median relative to each other as illustrated by the overlapping confidence ellipses of the two groups
(Fig. 2a). This pattern was even more pronounced on the NMDS calculated from the OTU table (Supplemental
Fig. S1).
The regression tree analysis identified a significant split in the dataset at an elevation of 1400 m, with a
Bray–Curtis dissimilarity coefficient averaging 0.37 for lakes situated above 1400 m in elevation while lakes
situated under 1400 m in elevation displayed an average of 0.57 (Fig. 3).
The hierarchical analysis identified four clusters according to their community composition, separating most
past samples from the recent samples (Fig. 4). More specifically, the clusters 1, 2 and 3 were only composed of
past samples except for the cluster 2, which contained the present and past samples of two lakes. The samples of
cluster 1 were dominated by the Oligohymenophorea (Class) Scuticociliatia (Subclass), samples of cluster 2 by

Colpodea (mainly Cyrtolophosidida), while samples of cluster 3 were dominated by Spirotrichea Hypotrichia
(Fig. 4). The ciliate communities of the samples from the fourth cluster were dominated by the Class Litostomatea,
subclass Haptoria. Although the fourth cluster regrouped past and recent samples, sub-clusters indicated a clear
separation of the recent samples from the past samples. When dividing the dataset into regional subgroups, the
hierarchical clustering analyses also separate the recent samples from the past samples (Fig. S2). This is with the
exception of the high elevation lakes located above 1400 m from the Alps and the Pyrenees. Across all regions,
the ciliate community of the recent samples tend to be dominated by the Class Litostomatea, subclass Haptoria. In
contrast, ciliate community of the past samples differs between regions. More specifically, lakes from the Vosges
and Massif Central were previously dominated by Colpodea, lakes from the Jura and the Alps were previously
dominated by Scuticociliata or Litostomatea. The SIMPER analysis applied on the subclass level indicated that
the increase of the Haptoria, the Oligotrichia and Armophorea explained 26%, 11% and 2% respectively of the
Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between the recent and past samples, while the decline of Colpodea, Hypotrichia,
Scuticociliatia and Prostomatea explained 19%, 18%, 6% and 3% of the dissimilarity. The differential abundance
analysis (DESeq2) provided information about the intensity of the changes between the recent and past s amples30.
The DESeq2 applied at the Genus level, indicated a significant increase of five genera and families of the subclass
Haptoria, two genera and families of the subclass Oligotrichia and the genus Metopus (class Armophorea),
as well as a significant increase of the Peritrichia and Suctoria (Supplemental Fig. S3). The DESeq2 analysis
also indicated a significant decline of Urotricha a genus of the class Prostomatea, two Scuticociliatia including
Cyclidium, five genera and families associated to the class Colpodea, and five genera and families associated to
the class Hypotrichia, as well as the significant decline of Peniculia.
Ciliates functional traits and lakes ecosystem functioning. The DESeq2 indicated a significant
increase of the facultative or strict anaerobe benthic ciliates while the benthic ciliates that require oxygen signifi-
cantly declined in the recent period (Fig. 5).
This increase in facultative or anaerobe benthic ciliates was mostly influenced by the significant increase in the
abundance of the genus Metopus (order: Armophorida, class: Armophorea) (Supplemental Fig. S3). Moreover,
there was a significant increase in sessile ciliates (i.e. attached to a substrate), as well as a significant increase in
the pelagic ciliates. In addition, the same analysis applied on the foraging trait categories indicated a significant
increase in mixotrophs, while bacterivores significantly declined in recent samples (Fig. 5).
Discussion
The present study represents the first paleolimnological reconstruction of ciliate communities. Over the last
decades, lakes have been exposed to environmental changes (anthropogenic stressors and natural changes) with
important implications on the biological communities. By using DNA-based methods, recent paleolimnological
studies have provided new insights on the long-term responses of microbial assemblages15. Previous paleolim-
nological investigations of overall microeukaryotes communities reported a strong response of the ciliates to
nutrients i nputs13,31. However, long-term changes in ciliates communities’ structure and functional ecology
had not been investigated yet. Through the use of primers that specifically target ciliates, our study brings an
innovative perspective. The results highlight changes in heterotrophic and mixotrophic communities that were
not previously revealed in the analysis of the overall microeukaryote community (i.e. using generalist primers).
Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of using these protists as indicators of environmental change

in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Analyses of the ciliate communities indicate an overall decline in the
β-diversity in recent times following the same trend as the overall microeukaryotes d iversity18. Interestingly, the
ciliates did not undergo a large turnover. Instead, our results indicate a spatial homogenization of the diversity
with a reorganisation of the community structure (i.e. switch in dominance) (Figs. 2 and 3).
Past ciliate communities were initially heterogeneous at the geographical scale of our study, with some simi-
larities in the community composition for lakes belonging to the same geological regions (Fig. S2). For instance,
lakes located on late Paleozoic igneous and metamorphic bedrocks (i.e. Massif Central and Vosges) were char-
acterized by past communities dominated by Colpodea. Bedrock geology can strongly influence the physico-
chemical properties of lakes, thereby having subsequent consequences on the natural spatial distribution of
c ommunities32–34. The heterogeneity of past communities was thus likely driven by historical environmental
conditions, and stands in contrast with the more homogeneous composition of the recent ciliate communities
across all lakes.
Biotic homogenization of communities is a well documented phenomenon. Previously observed in both ter-
restrial and aquatic ecosystems, biotic homogenization is strongly influenced by the decline in environmental
heterogeneity and availability of diverse ecological n iches35–37. In aquatic ecosystems, change in climate, produc-
tivity, and anthropogenic alteration of the watershed are the most prevalent causes of biotic homogenization38.
Several of our studied lakes are exposed to similar stressors which includes nutrient enrichment, agricultural
and urban development of the watershed and climate change39–42. As such, these factors likely acted as deter-
ministic filters selecting for a more homogeneous group of species dominated by generalist ciliates that display
more flexible life strategies.
The recent increase in the mixotrophic ciliates is a marked modification of the ciliate communities in response
to new environmental conditions43. Mixotrophic ciliates have been found to be abundant in the epilimnion of
stratified oligotrophic l akes44, as well as at the oxic-anoxic boundary of eutrophic freshwater p onds45. Moreover,
mixotrophic organisms have been found to thrive during transition phases between autotrophy-dominated and
heterotrophy-dominated s ystems46,47. As such, they can easily adapt when exposed to extreme events or highly-
variable environmental conditions46,47, which have been more frequent over the last decades48. In our studied

lakes, the genera Limnostrombidium spp. and Uroleptus spp. (Spirotrichea) are the dominant mixotrophic ciliates.
Both display mixotrophic life strategies whereby they harbor picoplanktonic species as algal endosymbionts43,49.
As such, changes in autotrophic picoplankton dynamic and structure previously recorded in some of our stud-
ied l akes16, might have provided them with a competitive advantage. Empirical studies are still needed in order
to better understand the underlying mechanisms benefiting mixotrophic life strategies. Nonetheless, recent
increase in the mixotrophic ciliates suggests that lakes might have undergone important trophodynamic changes
as mixotrophy is becoming an increasingly important pathway in aquatic food webs. These results also support
the importance of integrating the mixotrophic component when studying and modelling aquatic food webs50.
The spatial homogenization of the ciliate communities is also marked by the replacement of three clusters
by one homogeneous community dominated by Haptoria across all lakes. Haptoria is a widespread subclass
of ciliates that typically dominates planktonic communities of both eutrophic and oligotrophic freshwater
e nvironments51–53. As micropredators, they occupy an intermediate position within the microbial loop54, where
they are strongly exposed to both bottom-up and top-down forces55. These complex interactions are still poorly
understood. As such, it remains difficult to achieve a comprehensive picture of the processes that structure these
heterotrophic micropredator communities. Nonetheless, given their pivotal role as grazers of other ciliates, algae
and bacteria and as source of food for the metazooplankton, such changes in predatory ciliates abundance can
have important consequences on the structure and functioning of aquatic food webs55.
Changes in several other functional groups of ciliate provide additional evidence of recent modification of
the aquatic food web structure and habitat. For instance, the significant increase in pelagic ciliates support that
lakes might have been exposed to longer and stronger periods of stratification in recent time. Indeed, these
ciliates tends to be found in higher abundance in the epilimnium of stratified lakes27,52,56,57. Furthermore, the
significant increase in periphytic species, such as the sessile or sedentary forms Peritrichia and Suctoria, is con-
sistent with more frequent pelagic blooms or increased macrophytes growth under higher nutrient and warmer
conditions58,59.
In parallel to the changes observed in the pelagic ciliates, their benthic counterparts were also largely modi-
fied, indicating that the benthic environment has also been impacted by recent environmental changes. The sig-
nificant increase in the facultative or obligate anaerobic ciliate, such as Metopus, suggests that ciliate communities
have been directly influenced by the widespread deoxygenation of temperate lakes5 (Fig. 5 and Supplemental
Fig. S3). The significant decline in the benthic and hypolimnitic ciliates associated with well-oxygenated condi-
tions further support that the habitability of the sediment–water interface has been declining for this particular
group of ciliates. The depletion of oxygen concentrations in the profundal zone of freshwater lakes is a well
recorded global phenomenon that can have a pervasive impact on the overall ecosystem functioning60. These
changes have been associated with stronger and longer thermal stratification, as well as a loss of water clarity,
in part due to the increases in pelagic production5. Supporting this hypothesis, increase in the strict anaerobe
bacteriophage Metopus was recorded in lakes that are currently categorized as eutrophic or have experienced
unprecedented episodes of eutrophication or cyanobacterial bloom over the last decades, and subsequent periods
of deep water hypoxia61–63.
Although the homogenisation of the beta diversity is a global pattern that we observed, some lakes were more
particularly affected in terms of magnitude of change. A stronger restructuration of the ciliate communities
was observed in the low elevation lakes, thereby demonstrating that environmental changes in lowland lakes
impacted several trophic levels, including non-photosynthetic protist communities. The geographical variation
in the amplitude of changes in diversity and community turnover of microorganisms associated with an eleva-
tion gradient have been previously demonstrated in terrestrial64 and aquatic ecosystems65. These patterns are
explained by a more pronounced human footprint in lowlands64,66, which includes among others, the nutrient-
enrichment of freshwater ecosystems6. Supporting this trend, the present day trophic status of our studied lakes
was significantly higher for lowland lakes than for high elevation lakes (Supplemental Fig. S4). Altogether, our
results thus suggest that human-induced nutrient increase influenced the observed changes in the ciliate com-
munity diversity of lowland lakes.
Overall, our results provide evidence that the ciliate communities are strongly responding to various environ-
mental factors which includes widespread deoxygenation of deep waters, changes in thermal stratification and
nutrient-enrichment. Playing a key role in the metabolic pathways of aquatic ecosystems53,67, they can provide
valuable insight into the functional ecology of lakes. Although more empirical studies are needed in order to
better identify the underlying mechanisms involved, the strong response of ciliates recorded in the sedimentary
archives suggests important changes in the main pathways for the transfer of energy within the microbial food
webs68.
Altogether, the diagnosis of the changes in the ciliate communities across the 48 studied lakes supports the use
of ciliates as indicators of environmental c hanges69. Working with ancient DNA and metabarcoding of protists are
quite challenging, as such, several aspects need to be taken into consideration for future studies (as summarized
in Methods section of the Supplemental Material S1). Nonetheless, the present study as well as several previous
i nvestigations27,67,70 have shown the great success of using such approaches to assess environmental changes
in aquatic ecosystems. Their integration to environmental assessment using high-throughput sequencing and
metabarcoding technologies is thus promising, as they provide a more holistic view of the response of aquatic
ecosystems to environmental changes. This is even more relevant as the science is moving toward ecosystem-wide
food web modelling20,67,71, and protists, as key players of the microbial food-web, serve an important function
of recycling carbon and energy in lakes.

Methods
Study sites and sediment core collection. A total of 48 lakes were used in this study (Fig. 1, Supple-
mental Table S3). The studied lakes were selected because they were located along a large elevation gradient and
displayed various physico-chemical characteristics (Supplemental Table S3). For all 48 lakes, the sediment cores
were retrieved between 2010 and 2016 (cf. Keck et al.18 for more detailed information on each lake) from the
deepest part of the basin using a UWITEC gravity corer. Prior to subsampling, the core was air protected by a
double layer of plastic wrap and stored in the dark at 4 °C.
Methodological considerations and sample selection for sedaDNA analysis. A top–bottom
technique was used to provide a simplified assessment of the amplitude of change in the ciliate community
diversity and composition. Briefly, a top sample corresponding to recent time and a bottom sample correspond-
ing to the past were isolated from the cores.
The level of DNA preservation in the sediment (from one lake to another or when aging in sediment) is a sen-
sitive point to be taken into account for paleo-reconstruction studies, and for sample selection. Aquatic sediments
are, a priori, suitable environments for DNA preservation through the binding to mineral and organic particles,
and the absence of oxygen and UV radiation72,73. Nonetheless, several processes can alter DNA sequences in
marine74 and freshwater s ediments15. It was thus important to consider whether the differences observed between
top and bottom strata could be induced by diagenetic processes responsible for the modification of DNA signal
over time. The potential distortions to lake sediment DNA records due to taphonomic processes (production,
transfer, preservation of DNA) that affect DNA in sediments are not fully known. However, we know that (1)
the DNA signal is proven to be reliable for several centuries in lake sediments and the signal can be preserved
for several millennia if the preservation conditions are very good75; (2) the first few years after deposition are
critical for DNA preservation due to the biological activity at the sediment–water interface and the physical and
chemical changes that occur in the uppermost sediment layers12. To overcome this issue, the top strata were
sampled a few centimeters down the surface of the core (~ year 2000 C.E.) in order to minimize biases associated
with early diagenesis processes and active benthic ciliates (more details about the selection of the samples and
methodological considerations can be found in the online Supplemental Material S1). The depth of the bottom
samples was chosen for each core in order to correspond to the pre-“Great Acceleration” p eriod2,3 (i.e. nineteenth
century) which was determined using a combination of several approaches (i.e. X-ray fluorescence, radiocarbon
and radionuclides 210Pb and 137Cs; cf. the Supplementary Material Methods S1 and Table S4). In order to ensure
that each sample covered at least 10–15 years, the thickness of the sediment samples was individually adjusted
(cf. the Supplementary Material Methods S1 and Table S4). Sub-sampling for DNA analysis was conducted in a
clean and controlled environment using strict laboratory protocols to avoid contamination by modern DNA15,18.
Molecular analysis. Two DNA extractions were performed on 0.5 g of wet sediment for each sample using
the NucleoSpin® soil kit, according to the manufacturer instructions (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany). The
same DNA extracts as in Keck et al.18 were used. Refer to the Method section of the Supplementary Material
S1 for more details regarding the laboratory protocol and conditions applied for the DNA extraction. A nested-
PCR targeting the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene was used to do the inventory of the ciliate community. In the
first step, a set of primers was used to target a specific DNA region for ciliates of 800 bp CS322F (5ʹ-GAT GGT
AGT GTA TTG GAC -3ʹ) and 1147R (5ʹ-GAC GGT ATC TRA TCG TCT TT-3ʹ)76,77. The first PCR was performed in
a total volume of 25 µL containing 1 µL of DNA extract, 2.5 µL of 10X NH4 reaction buffer, 2 µL of 50 mM of
MgCl2, 0.5 µL of 100 mM dNTP, 1.25 µL of each primer at 10 pmol/µL, 2 µL of 10 mg/mL BSA and 0.1 µL of
5 Ci BioTaq (Bioline). The amplification cycle included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 20
cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 57 °C and 30 s at 72 °C. The amplicons were then subjected to a final 10 min exten-
sion at 72 °C. The second PCR was then applied on the products of the first PCR using general eukaryotic prim-
ers NSF573 (5′-CGC GGT AAT TCC AGC TCC A-3′) and NSR951 (5′-TTG GYR AAT GCT TTCGC-3′)78, amplify-
ing DNA fragment of about 378 bp. Molecular tails were added to the forward primer (5′-CTT TCC CTA CAC
GAC GCT CTT CCG ATCT-3′) and to the reverse primer (5′-GGA GTT CAG ACG TGT GCT CTT CCG ATCT-3′).
The second PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 µL containing 0.8 µL of DNA from the first PCR, 2 µL of
10X NH reaction buffer, 1.6 µL of 50 mM of M gCl, 0.4 µL of 100 mM dNTP, 1 µL of each primer with molecu-
4 2
lar tails at 10 pmol/µL, 1.6 µL of 10 mg/mL BSA and 0.06 µL of 5 Ci BioTaq (Bioline). The amplification cycle
included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 20 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 57 °C and 45 s
at 72 °C. The amplicons were then subjected to a final 10 min extension at 72 °C. The nested-PCR protocol was
applied on each DNA extraction separately, the full volume of the final products resulting from the two DNA
extracts of the same sample were then pooled and sent to GeT-PlaGe (Plateforme Génomique 31326 CASTA-
NET-TOLOSAN Cedex) for amplicon purification, library preparation and paired-end (2 × 250 bp) sequencing
on a MiSeq Illumina instrument (San Diego, CA, USA).
The reads were demultiplexed and R1/R2 reads assembled into contigs by the sequencing platform who
provided one fastq files per sample. The high-throughput sequencing data were then cleaned in Mothur 1.45.179.
Filtering steps were used to conserve DNA sequences of 350 ± 50 bp in length, with no ambiguities (N = 0), 10
or less homopolymer (max homopolymer = 10) and no mismatch was allowed in the primer sequence. The data
was dereplicated in order to work with Individual Sequence Unit (ISU). ISUs were then aligned using an aligned
version of the Silva 18S database restrained to the V4 region and ISUs that were not fully aligned to the Silva
18S barcode were removed. The detection and removal of chimera was done using Vsearch as implemented in
Mothur with default parameters. The taxonomic assignment of the ISU was done using a curated version of the

Ciliates that can be found in the littoral zone or well-oxygenated bottoms (some of these ben-
Benthic (oxic conditions) thic ciliates can migrated to the anoxic–oxic layer of the pelagic zone when the bottom of the
lake become anoxic during stratification periods)
Freshwater ciliates that are either endocommensals of bivalves or ectocommensals of fish, or
Commensals or Parasites
parasites of fish
Categories associated with the limnetic habitat
Facultative or obligate anaerobe living in the benthic environment but also includes some taxa
Facultative or obligate anaerobe
able to live in anaerobic deep waters
Pelagic Euplanktonic ciliates
Sessile Ciliates for which their life cycle includes a stage attached to a substrate (usually stalked ciliates)
Herbivorous Algivores
Ciliates that exclusively feed on bacteria, these ciliates are usually associated with the benthic
Bacterivores
environment or found in the metalimnion of highly productive lakes
Regroup: (1) Ciliates that feed on other ciliates or even small metazoans; (2) Omnivorous cili-
Predators
ates feeding on algae, bacteria and other small ciliates
Categories associated with foraging strategies Regroup parasites, bacterivores and histophage ciliates; commensals and parasitic ciliates were
kept separated, as they are more likely to be directly influenced by the presence/absence of their
Commensals and parasites
hosts rather than influenced by changes in the biotic and abiotic factors of the surrounding
environment
Fungivorous This category contains only one species found in our samples Pseudoplatyophrya nana
Phagotrophic ciliates that harbor algal endosymbionts or sequester plastids from their algal
Mixotrophs
prey; mixotrophic ciliates thus tend to be also algivores

with a confidence score threshold of 75% and 100 iterations. Following this first taxonomic assignment, the ISU
represented with only one read or that were identified as “unknown” or “Eukaryota_unclassified” were removed.
The ISUs were then clustered into molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) using the furthest neighbour
algorithm with a similarity threshold of 97%, as previously suggested by Stoeck et al.81. Finally, the command
classify.otu() was used to taxonomically assign the OTUs based on the first taxonomic assignment of the ISUs
with a confidence threshold of 80%. The OTUs that did not belong to the Phylum Ciliophora were removed.
The taxonomic affiliations were checked and harmonized manually using the classification from Gao et al.82.
In order to study changes in the functional groups, the ecological preferences (i.e. preferred limnetic habitat or
foraging traits; cf. Table 1) were indexed for the OTUs for which the taxonomic affiliation was fine enough (at
least assigned to the family rank); otherwise, the category “Unknown” was given. The association of OTUs to
their functional traits was done through an exhaustive literature review. The foraging traits categories created
were inspired from a combination of several previously published categories based on the feeding ecology of
c iliates22,53,69,83. Table used with the information about the functional traits is available on open access (http://
doi.o rg/1 0.5 281/z enodo.5 53433 3).
Statistical analysis. Analyses were done using the R software version 3.1184 using the vegan package85, the
rpart package86 and DESeq2 package30.
The normality and homogeneity of variance of the environmental variables were tested using a Shapiro–Wilk
test of normality87 and a Fligner-Killeen’s test88, respectively. If the variables were not normally distributed even
after transformation non-parametric test were used. A Spearman correlation analysis was applied to study the
relationship between the environmental variables. To assess the relationship between lake topology and trophic
status the Kruskal test was used; whenever the Kruskal test89 was significant, in order to assess which categories
of trophic status were significantly different, a Wilcoxon rank sum test as Post Hoc test was applied using the
False Discovery Rate approach by Benjamini and Hochberg90 to adjust the p value for multiple testing (Sup-
plemental Fig. S4).
In order to harmonise data and allow comparison between samples, reads were transformed into relative
abundance. Changes in the β-diversity of the ciliates at the community level between the past and recent sam-
ples were investigated using a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix that was built based on the relative abundance
data at the subclass level. Results were visualized on a NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling analysis).
To evaluate the change in dispersion and thus in diversity between the past and recent samples, the distances
between the samples and the geometric median for each group (“recent” and “past”) were calculated. The differ-
ence between the median of each group was then tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test in order to evaluate
the overall displacement of the recent and past samples. A hierarchical cluster analysis on Bray–Curtis distances
using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was used to identify if a clear separation
could be observed between and within recent and past samples. A SIMPER analysis (SIMilarity PERcentage)91
was performed on the relative abundance data to calculate the contribution of each subclass to the overall
Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between the recent and past samples. The most abundant species can have a high
contribution even when they do not differ among groups, as they tend to display the highest v ariance85, as such,
the proportion in SIMPER contribution, in average change between recent and past samples, as well as the total
number of reads were compared to each other.
In order to evaluate the relative importance of known physical characteristic of the lakes (i.e. continuous
variables: elevation, maximum depth, surface area of the lake, surface area of the watershed) to the amplitude

of changes in the β-diversity, a univariate regression tree analysis was applied on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity
between the recent and past sample of each lake. For categorical data (i.e. Trophic Status), an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to compare the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity coefficients between categories.
The difference in abundance between the recent and past samples was also evaluated for each functional group
and at the Genus level using the DESeq2 framework applied on the raw count d ata30. The results were expressed as
“log2foldchange” and provided an indication of the intensity of the changes between the recent and past samples.
For the creation of the map, the software Q GIS92 was used, for all other figures, we used the package ggplot293
and the color palette from the package scico94 to create scientifically derived color-maps accessible for people
with colour-vision deficiencies95.
