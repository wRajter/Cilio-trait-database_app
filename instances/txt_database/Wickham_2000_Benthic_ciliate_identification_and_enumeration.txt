ABSTRACT: The study of the ecological role played by benthic ciliates is hampered by the lack of a
methodology to accurately enumerate benthic ciliates with good taxonomic resolution. As a result, a
technique was developed that combined 2 previously published methods developed to identify and
count pelagic ciliates and benthic flagellates, respectively. The new method utilizes centrifugation in a
non-linear density gradient to separate ciliates from sediment, and the QPS (quantitative protargol
stain) silver-staining technique to stain the cilia and nuclei of ciliates which, after centrifugation, are
concentrated on cellulose nitrate filters. The wide applicability of the method was shown by utilizing it
to count and identify ciliates in cores taken from intertidal sediment and sampled on a 2 mm depth in-
terval. The intertidal cores had a total of 41 species or morphotypes present, but no more than 21 spe-
cies or morphotypes in any single 2 mm layer. Total ciliate abundance was as high as 2500 cells ml–1,
with the upper layers having higher abundance than deeper layers. There was no obvious pattern with
depth either for the number of species found in any one layer, or for ciliate diversity. The method was
further utilized in an experiment that explored the interactions between benthic ciliates and the ostra-
cod Cyrideis trosa. Ostracods reduced the final abundance of ciliates, but this effect was confined to
the upper 5 mm of sediment. Two-thirds of the ostracods were found in the 5–10 mm layer at the end of
the experiment, but while there was an effect on ciliate diversity in this layer, there was no effect on to-
tal ciliate abundance. We conclude that the method is suitable for studying both the natural distribu-
tion and diversity of benthic ciliates and their response to experimental manipulations.

Total ciliate abundance was high in the Wattenmeer
sediment, especially in comparison to previously pub-
lished values obtained using other methods (Kemp
1990, Epstein & Gallagher 1992, Epstein 1995) and, to a
lesser extent, to the Rassower Strom sediment used in
the ostracod experiment (see below). In the layers be-
tween 0 and 10 mm depth (comparable to the ostracod
experiment samples), ciliate abundance was between
1000 and 2500 cells ml–1(Fig. 3A). In the layers beneath
10 mm, total ciliate abundance was considerably less,
but did not drop beneath 180 ciliates ml–1. While there
was considerable variance between the cores, and gen-
erally higher abundance in the second core, similar
trends in both cores could be seen. There was reduced

The most consistently abundant group in the Wat-
tenmeer cores were members of the family Cyclidi-
idae, species in the genera Cyclidium and Cristigera.
These small scuticociliates had a maximum abundance
of 720 cells ml–1 (in the 6–8 mm layer), and a mean
abundance of 230 cells ml–1, averaged over all depths
in the 2 cores (Fig. 4). The most abundant ciliate in any
single layer was Mesodinium pulex, which had a max-
imum abundance of 850 cells ml–1in the 0–2 mm layer
of one core, or 40% of the total ciliate abundance in
this layer and core. However, M. pulex was mostly
confined to the surface layer, and did not make up
more than 3% of the total abundance in any other
layer. Also abundant in the surface layer was Chlamy-
dodon mnemosyne, with a maximum abundance of
820 cells ml–1. The most abundant ciliate in the deeper
layers was Remanella spp., which had a maximum
abundance of 540 cells ml–1 in the 12–14 mm layer
(Fig. 4). Together, the 6 most abundant groups (Cycli-
diidae, M. pulex, C. mnemosyne,Remanellaspp., Eu-
plotes spp. and Aspidisca sp.) made up ~50% of the
total ciliate abundance. There was also a dominance of
