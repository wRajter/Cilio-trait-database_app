originallydescribedfromfreshwaterhabitatsbutlaterreliablyrecorded(bysilverimpregnation)fromterrestrialenvironments.
True Sphagnumspecies and species from ephemeralpuddleswereexcluded,ifnotlaterreliablyrecordedfromterrestrialhabi

2) Forliterature of original species descriptions, recent combinations, importantredescriptions, and synonymies (most subjec

3) Classification mainly after [34J, that of colpodids after [84]. CO = colpodid, CY = cyrtophorid, GY = gymnostomatid
(haptorid), HE = heterotrich, HM = hymenostome, HY= hypotrich, NA = nassulid, OL = oligotrich, PE = peritrich, PR =
