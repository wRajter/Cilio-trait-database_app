Monograph of the Dileptids (Protista, Ciliophora, Rhynchostomatia)
Peter Vďačný & Wilhelm Foissner
Abstract: Dileptids are holotrichously ciliated, rapacious ciliates with a conspicuous proboscis
carrying a complex ciliary pattern. Most species have a wide or global distribution, occurring in
limnetic, marine, and terrestrial environments as well as in benthic and planktonic habitats. Light- and
electronmicroscopical investigations suggested the dileptids as strongly derived crown Litostomatea
(Gymnostomatea pro parte, Haptoria p.p., Trichostomatia p.p.) because of their complex morphology
and ontogenesis. However, recent molecular studies show the opposite: the dileptids form a distinct clade
at the base of the litostomateans, supporting the subclass Rhynchostomatia established by Jankowski
(1980). The last common ancestor of dileptids and other litostomateans (Haptoria, Trichostomatia)
was possibly a rather complex ciliate with a paroral membrane (~ circumoral kinety) and many adoral
membranelles (~ preoral kineties).
The genus Dileptus was established by DuJarDin (1841). Although afterwards some interesting studies
on dileptid biology and diversity were performed, progress was slow during the next ninety years.
In 1931, kahl revised the dileptids recognizing three genera (Dileptus, Paradileptus, Trachelius)
and 25 nominal species, including eight new ones. After kahl’s classic study, more protozoologists
became interested in the biology and taxonomy of the dileptids, which culminated in the monograph
of Dragesco (1963). He revised the genus Dileptus and recognized about 50 species, showing that
dileptid diversity doubled between 1931 and 1963. In the following decades, the number of genera
and species increased slowly but steadily. In our monograph, we recognize 12 genera and 181 nominal
species, of which 66 are possibly reliable dileptid taxa; however, only 46 species and subspecies are
so well described that their identity is not threatened. We establish two new genera (Apotrachelius and
Microdileptus) and 18 new species and subspecies including those recently described by Vďačný &
Foissner (2008a, b): Apodileptus edaphicus, A. visscheri rhabdoplites, Apotrachelius multinucleatus,
Dileptus sphagnicola, Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides paucivacuolatum, D. arenicola, D. brasiliense,
Microdileptus microstoma, M. semiarmatus, Pseudomonilicaryon brachyproboscis, P. fraterculum,
P. gracile antevacuolatum, P. gracile oviplites, P. marinum minimum, Rimaleptus brasiliensis, R.
canadensis, R. longitrichus, and R. tirjakovae. Further, we redescribe and/or provide additional figures
for ten species: Apodileptus visscheri visscheri, Dileptus anatinus, D. costaricanus, Monomacrocaryon
polyvacuolatum, M. terrenum, Pelagodileptus trachelioides, Pseudomonilicaryon falciforme, P.
thononense, Rimaleptus armatus, and R. binucleatus. The synonymy rate is 27.5% but increases to
60.5% when taxa with “unclear identity” are included.
The monograph commences with a detailed general section, showing the dileptid morphology,
ultrastructure, resting cysts, ontogenesis, conjugation, ecology, and phylogeny. Further, we provide
protocols for the methods used in studying the dileptid organization (live observation, silver nitrate
impregnation, protargol impregnation, scanning electron microscopy) and a detailed terminology. In
the main section of the monograph, we provide, if available, the following data for each species:
author, date, and journal page of the original description; a list of synonyms; nomenclatural matters;
a morphological treatise including the original description, redescriptions, and all figures published;
morphometric data; details on ontogenesis and resting cysts; a comparison with related species; and a
detailed compilation of ecological and faunistic data. The monograph ends with a carefully prepared
reference section and an index to the scientific names mentioned in the text.
Key words: 18S rRNA gene, benthos, biodiversity, conjugation, distribution, ecology, Haptoria,
limnetic, marine and terrestrial habitats, Litostomatea, plankton, new genera, new species, nomenclature,
ontogenesis, synonymy rate.

Introduction
Biodiversity studies came into fashion since various international activities emphasized their importance
for human well-being (World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1992). However, a central goal of these
activities, viz., the study and description of individual species, is still a matter of a few specialists because
financial resources for alpha-taxonomy are usually very limited and the modern universities often neglect
this discipline. This is a global trend known as taxonomic impediment and is especially pronounced in
protists (cotterill et al. 2008, cotterill & Foissner 2009). Nonetheless, there is an increased willingness
of ranked scientific journals to publish this kind of research, the present monograph being a good example.
Likewise, financial support can be obtained from regional and government agencies. With the “Monograph
of the Dileptids”, we continue our attempt to revise larger groups of ciliates so comprehensively that users
need not go back to the original literature, which is often very old and thus difficult to obtain (Foissner
1993; Berger 1999, 2006, 2008; aescht 2001; Foissner & Xu 2007).
Dileptids are holotrichously ciliated litostomatean ciliates with a conspicuous proboscis (kahl 1931,
Dragesco 1963, lynn 2008). Most species have a wide or global distribution and prefer terrestrial habitats,
while limnetic and, especially, marine species are rare. However, we possibly know only the most common
species because dileptids are predators rarely attaining high abundances. Thus, they are easily overlooked
or the material is too sparse for detailed investigation.
Dileptus has been seen probably already by leeuwenhoek (DoBell 1932). But the formal recognition
occurred much later by DuJarDin (1841) because mueller (1786) and ehrenBerg (1838) mixed it with
Vibrio and Amphileptus. DuJarDin (1841) founded Dileptus with three nominal species without fixing any
as the type; this was done by Fromentel (1875), using D. folium. Unfortunately, this species turned out to
be a junior synonym of Litonotus cygnus (wrześniowski 1870, kahl 1931). This and other nomenclatural
problems will be discussed in our monograph.
Although some interesting studies were performed after Dileptus had been established, little progress
occurred in the next ninety years, when kahl (1931) revised the genus, recognizing 25 nominal species
including eight new ones. After kahl’s classic study, more protozoologists became interested in the
dileptids, which culminated in the monograph of Dragesco (1963), who reviewed the biology and taxonomy
of Dileptus and recognized about 50 species, showing that their diversity doubled between 1931 and 1963.
With the onset of silver impregnation, several species were redescribed and some were discovered, mainly
by Foissner (1984, 1989), wirnsBerger et al. (1984), song et al. (1988), song (1994b), song & wilBert
(1989), and Foissner et al. (1995, 1999, 2002). In the present monograph, we recognized 12 genera and 66
species, of which 18 were new to science including the five new species described by Vďačný & Foissner
(2008a, b), indicating that dileptid diversity is far from being exhausted. Only 46 out of the 66 species can
be considered so well-described that their identity is not threatened. The synonymy rates match those of
ciliates in general (aescht 2001, Foissner et al. 2008a), i.e., is 27.5% for dileptid species but increases to
60.5% when taxa with “unclear identity” are included.
Light- and electronmicroscopic taxonomists considered dileptids as highly derived crown litostomateans
because of their complex morphology and ontogenesis (Puytorac et al. 1993, grain 1994, Xu & Foissner
2005, Vďačný & Foissner 2009). However, this is not supported by the recent molecular investigations,
which show the dileptid clade at the base of the litostomateans (Vďačný et al. 2011). Further, their genetic
distinctness is so pronounced that subclass rank appears appropriate, supporting the Rhynchostomatia
proposed by Jankowski (1980). The last common ancestor of the dileptids and other litostomateans
(Haptoria and Trichostomatia) was possibly a rather complex ciliate with a paroral membrane and many
adoral membranelles (Vďačný et al. 2010).

Dileptus served as model organism for cell biologist in investigations of the influence of physical and
chemical factors on morphogenesis and regeneration. Most of these studies were performed by golińska
(1965–1996). More recently, Vďačný & Foissner (2008a, 2009) provided detailed data on ontogenesis
and conjugation. Feeding was studied by Visscher (1923) and Dragesco (1962). Modern investigations
on the ecology of dileptids are lacking, except for a few studies by Butkay (2004) and sonntag et al.
(2007). Foissner et al. (1995, 1999) reviewed those species which are used as quality indicators in limnetic
habitats.
In our monograph, we provide a detailed general section on the dileptids and critically review the taxonomy,
ecology, and faunistics of all dileptids described. Further, we provide tables on genera associated with
dileptids and nominal species; protocols for studying dileptids; and introduce a precise terminology.
A General Section
1 Morphology and Principal Terms
In this section, we explain the principal morphology and terminology. The latter is based on Foissner
& Xu (2007) and done briefly because all specific terms are illustrated in Figures 1–17. For general
protistological and specific ciliate terminology, we refer to the excellent compilations of corliss (1979),
margulis et al. (1993), Puytorac (1994), and lynn (2008).
1.1 Size and Shape, Morphometry (Figs 1, 2; Tables 1, 2)
The dileptids range from about 100 × 15 µm to 1,500 × 150 µm in vivo. The volume of one of the largest
species, Monomacrocaryon gigas, is about 1000 times larger than that of one of the smallest species,
Rimaleptus alpinus. This is a small range, as in the spathidiids (Foissner & Xu 2007), when compared to
the colpodids (200,000; Foissner 1993). We have used four categories of size (as reflected in body length;
arbitrarily if unrealistically set up with non-overlapping ranges) as follows: small (100–300 µm), medium
(300–500 µm), large (500–1,000 µm), and very large (> 1,000 µm). Likewise, we have established four
categories of proboscis length (Fig. 1).
The dileptid body typically consists of a proboscis, a trunk, and a tail (Fig. 1). These variables produce a
huge variety of shapes classified in Figure 1. However, most shapes fall into three categories: narrowly
dileptid (length:width ratio 3:1–6:1), very narrowly dileptid (l:w 6:1–9:1), and cylindroidally dileptid (l:w
9:1–12:1). Most species are slightly flattened laterally, especially the proboscis. Many of the terrestrial
species are small and/or slender, as is typical for soil organisms in general (Foissner 1987a). However,
those living in mosses and leaf litter may be rather large, for instance, Rimaleptus conspicuus. The shape
is stabilized by bundles of cortical microtubules (grain & golińska 1969), but the cortex remains flexible
and the shape may thus strongly deform in over- or under-nourished cells. True polymorphism is absent,
thus we prefer “vegetative cells” rather than “trophonts” or “theronts”. A few specimens show pronounced
contractility, viz., Rimaleptus lacazei, Monomacrocaryon tenue, and Pseudomonilicaryon dimorphum.
Unfortunately, the base of the contractility (myonemes?) is not known.
Invariably, the oral opening is at the base of the proboscis, which is part of the oral apparatus and has a
complex ciliature and ontogenesis. Both the proboscis and the oral opening show a variety of features
important for species identification. They will be discussed in the section on “oral apparatus”.
Detailed morphometrics are available from about 48 populations belonging to 37 species, mainly due
to the studies of the Foissner group and the present monograph (Table 1). Morphometric data provide
important information about the stability of features and their significance for species recognition. Most
useful are characteristics with variation coefficients between 5–10% because they are sufficiently, but

not too highly, variable. An example is the number of ciliary rows (Tables 1, 2) which, additionally, is
positively correlated with body width (Fig. 2), usually having a higher variability (~ 15%). Generally, the
mean coefficients of variation are slightly higher in dileptids than in other groups of ciliates but are far
from being “highly variable” (Table 2). The impression of high variability often focuses on a single or a
few features, in dileptids on the length of the proboscis and tail (Fig. 1), both being rather fragile easily
becoming distorted or lost when cells are studied in vivo under even mild coverslip pressure.
Experimental studies showed that the number of ciliary rows depends not only on genetic mechanisms but
also on nutrition. The number of kineties and the interkinetal distances are upward regulated in overfed
cells, while downward regulation is still unknown (Drzewińska & golińska 1987).

1.2 Nuclear Apparatus (Figs 3b–e, 4)
The nuclear apparatus is in the trunk and usually conspicuous. In the dileptids, there are four basic patterns
and some subtypes, all shown in Figures 3b–e and 4. The molecular investigations and the Hennigian
argumentation schemes indicate that the mononucleate or binucleate pattern is plesiomorphic, while the
moniliform and the multinucleate patterns are derived (Figs 31, 32, 34, 35). Some patterns probably
evolved convergently several times.

Fig. 2: Scatterplot showing a positive correlation
between body width and number of ciliary rows in
dileptid ciliates.
The nuclear apparatus, especially the macronuclear pattern, is one of the most important features for genus
and species recognition. Five out of the 12 genera recognized are based on this pattern: Monomacrocaryon
(single macronucleus), Rimaleptus (two macronuclear nodules), Dileptus (multinucleate), Apodileptus
(the macronuclear nodules fuse into a globular mass during ontogenesis), and Pseudomonilicaryon
(macronucleus moniliform).
The nuclear patterns are as stable or as variable as those of other ciliates and are sometimes obscured by
post-divisional, post-conjugational, or ontogenetic processes (Foissner & Xu 2007, Vďačný & Foissner
2008a, 2009). When in doubt, look at very early dividers which invariably show the “real” nuclear
pattern. So far, chromatin extrusion has not been described.
The macronucleus contains globular, oblong, or irregular masses about 1–5 µm in size. Usually, they
are recognizable in vivo and impregnate deeply with protargol. There is some indication that these
inclusions represent nucleoli: (i) the central mass of the macronucleus of Colpoda steinii and Dileptus
sp. deeply impregnates with protargol and represents a compound nucleolus, according to cytochemical
and electronmicroscopical investigations (raikoV 1982, Foissner 1993); (ii) chromatin bodies are usually
smaller than 1 µm and numerous, while nucleoli are often larger than 1 µm and comparatively rare (raikoV
1982). These features apply to the macronuclear structures impregnating with various protargol methods
and recognizable with transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 3c). Thus, we designate these structures
as “nucleoli”, being aware that this needs confirmation by cytochemical investigations. See VinnikoVa
(1974b) and Bohatier et al. (1978) for electronmicroscopical descriptions of the macronucleus of Dileptus
margaritifer and kink (1973) for an investigation of the nuclear apparatus of Apodileptus visscheri.
The ploidy of most macronuclei of D. margaritifer is about 12n. Some macronuclei may, however, reach
a ploidy degree of 30–60n. The total ploidy level of all macronuclei of a specimen can amount to 2000–
5000n (VinnikoVa 1977).

1.3 Contractile Vacuoles and Cytopyge (Fig. 5)
Most dileptids have at least two contractile vacuoles in the dorsal side of the trunk; monovacuolate species
have been described but are highly questionable. The number of contractile vacuoles is related to body
size: small species have two to four, large ones may have > 50 and not only in the dorsal side of the
trunk but also in its ventral side and the full length of the proboscis, for instance, Pseudomonilicaryon
fraterculum and P. japonicum. Basically, six contractile vacuole patterns can be distinguished and are
important for species recognition (Fig. 5).
The fluid collected by the contractile vacuoles is expelled via one to three intrakinetal excretory pores per
vacuole. Rarely, the excretory pores are outside the kineties or scattered throughout the cell’s periphery,
for instance, in Trachelius ovum. In small species with two contractile vacuoles and two dorsal brush
rows, the excretory pores are usually associated with brush row 2, for instance, in Rimaleptus armatus and
Microdileptus breviproboscis. In the large species, the contractile vacuoles are not in line but in a more or
less broad stripe, for instance, in Pseudomonilicaryon anser.
Details on the contractile vacuoles of Dileptus margaritifer have been reported by FerBer & hausmann
(1985). They found: the total number of vacuoles was greater in longer specimens; there are no collection
canals or vesicles; the average diastolic diameter is 4 µm (range 2–5 µm); the average frequency of
contractions was 25 s; the vacuoles towards the front and back ends of the cell contract less frequently
than those towards the cell centre; there is no correlation between vacuolar output and volume of the
intervacuolar cytoplasm or the intervacuolar cell surface area; there is an apparent gradient in the functional
activity of the contractile vacuoles, with a maximum encountered immediately behind the cytopharynx.
Usually, there is a “defecation vacuole” subterminally. It contains indigestible food remnants which are
released via the cytopyge in posterior body end. Details on the dileptid cytopyge are not known. Silver
preparations do not show special structures in the posterior pole area.

1.4 Extrusomes (Figs 6, 7c, 9b–f, 17a–d)
Shape, size, and arrangement of the extrusomes are highly diverse and are thus a main diagnostic feature
of the individual species (Fig. 6). Accordingly, the extrusomes must be carefully studied in vivo because
they often become distorted in protargol preparations or do not impregnate at all. Indeed, the extrusome
features are so important that species cannot be recognized without this information.
All dileptids are predators. Thus, they have toxicysts of ordinary fine structure (grain & golińska 1969;
Fig. 7c). Most of the well-investigated species have two shape and/or size types of toxicysts, here named
“type I” (for the more conspicuous ones) and “type II” (usually inconspicuous rods less than 5 µm long).
Further, all dileptids have mucocysts, appearing as “cortical granules” in the light microscope (Figs 133b,
c). See hausmann (1978) and rosati & moDeo (2002) for excellent general reviews on extrusomes, and
Dragesco et al. (1965) for a study on the structure and origin of the toxicysts and mucocysts in Dileptus.
Extrusome production occurs throughout the life cycle. When the proboscis is excised, the extrusomes
move from the cytoplasm into the regenarating proboscis (Doroszewski & golińska 1967).
We have summarized extrusome shape and terminology in Figure 6. The toxicysts are studded in the oral
bulge and scattered in the cytoplasm; very rarely, they may be attached also to the somatic cortex, viz.,
in Rimaleptus nistroviensis. For determining the shape, size and arrangement of the toxicysts only fully
developed (mature) organelles may be used, that is, those which are anchored to the oral bulge or somatic
cortex (Fig. 6); cytoplasmic toxicysts are frequently not fully developed. This is evident, inter alia, from
their impregnation capacity: anchored toxicysts usually do not impregnate with protargol, while various
cytoplasmic developmental stages often impregnate deeply.
Shape and arrangement of the mucocysts are much less diverse than in toxicysts, at least in the light
microscope (Fig. 6). They are globular, broadly ellipsoidal, or ellipsoidal and ≤ 2 µm long. In the light
microscope, the mucocysts appear granular (“cortical granules”) and are arranged in rows following
the slightly oblique course of the postciliary microtubular ribbons (williams et al. 1981, Foissner et
al. 2002; Figs 94f, 133b). When densely arranged, the mucocysts form an opaque sheet in the cortex,
obscuring more or less completely the ciliary pattern, depending on their affinity to protargol. In the light
microscope, usually only one type of cortical granules is recognizable, for instance, in Dileptus sphagnicola
(Fig. 86d) and Pseudomonilicaryon japonicum (Fig. 133b), while two types can be distinguished in the
transmission electron microscope: one type is globular and deeply stained, while the other is oblong and
of typical mucocyst structure (Dragesco et al. 1965, grain & golińska 1969, kink 1973; Figs 9b–f). The
refractivity of the cortical granules depends on species, indicating differences in their composition, e.g.,
the highly refractive granules lining the oral sac of Dimacrocaryon (Figs 17a, b). The mucocysts are not
easily released. Methyl green-pyronin, which causes mucocyst extrusion in many ciliates (Foissner 1991),
is usually ineffective. By chance, we were successful in obtaining some good SEM micrographs from
released mucocysts in Apotrachelius multinucleatus (Figs 47s, u, v) and Pelagodileptus trachelioides
(Fig. 141f). They look like typical mucocysts (hausmann 1978). Possibly, the voluminous coat in some
protargol-impregnated species is caused by mucocysts, e.g., in Microdileptus breviproboscis (Fig. 9i).
1.5 Cytoplasm and Colour (Figs 7, 17)
All dileptids are colourless. However, when packed with highly refractive food and/or lipid droplets, they
appear dark or black under low bright-field magnification, for instance, Dileptus anatinus (Figs 89a, b) and
D. margaritifer (Figs 94a–e). Some species are green due to ingested or symbiotic algae (zoochlorellae),
for instance, D. viridis.

In contrast to many other ciliates, e.g., the hypotrichs and colpodids, the dileptids lack cytoplasmic crystals
although hausmann (1982) depicts a crystal in D. margaritifer; those found in the defecation vacuoles are
most likely from the prey. The young food vacuoles are usually large because the prey is often ingested
as a whole; however, such vacuoles soon dissociate into several smaller ones with granular contents,
for instance, in Microdileptus breviproboscis (Figs 80l–n). Mitochondria and other general cytoplasmic
organelles are as in other ciliates (Figs 7, 17).
1.6 Movement
Dileptids show three kinds of movement associated with their habit and great body flexibility: gliding
and creeping, semisessile, and swimming. Most common is gliding and creeping slowly to rapidly on and
among mud and soil particles. However, when approaching the free water, they swim by left spiralling
rotation about the main body axis (seraVin 1970), whereby the proboscis performs complex probing actions,
for instance, in Pseudomonilicaryon fraterculum (Figs 115v–y). Only few species have a semisessile
habit: the highly contractile P. dimorphum can attach to water plants with the contracted tail, forming
pseudopodium-like processes; P. anser and P. fraterculum can attach to various substrates by thigmotactic
cilia; and Dileptus jonesi forms a mucous thread attaching the cell to various substrates. A nice case of
attachment has been reported by Fauré-Fremiet (1910), who observed that Dileptus aggregated in the
leaf rosetts of Chara (Fig. 7d). Finally, the two euplanktonic species, Pelagodileptus trachelioides and
Paradileptus elephantinus, swim constantly in the water column, vigorously probing with the proboscis.
For details on movement, see the individual species descriptions and the study by Doroszewski (1961).
1.7 Somatic Ciliature and Ultrastructure
1.7.1 Fine Structure of Kinetids (Figs 9a, b, d)
The dileptids belong to the litostomatean ciliates whose somatic basal bodies have the following fibrillar
associates (lynn 2008; Figs 9a, b, d): a kinetodesmal fibre, a postciliary microtubule ribbon right of the
kinety, and two transverse microtubule ribbons left of the kinety. The dileptids follow this pattern but
have two modifications (Dumont 1961, grain & golińska 1969, kink 1973, golińska 1996). First, the
postciliary microtubule ribbons are especially long and extend slightly obliquely posteriorly, filling the
interkinetal space. They are recognizable in good protargol preparations (Fig. 77i) and in the scanning
electron microscope, where the microtubule bundles produce minute cortical ridges (Figs 119g, m).
Second, dileptids have well developed “root fibres”, i.e., microtubule bundles that originate from the
proximal end of the basal bodies and extend through the tela corticalis into the endoplasm.
1.7.2 Fine Structure of Cilia (Figs 9g–i)
The cilia of all dileptids as yet impregnated with protargol show a unique property not described in any
other group of ciliates: the proximal half impregnates faintly, as usual, while the distal half impregnates
deeply and then appears slightly thickened (Fig. 9i). Thus, we investigated the cilia of Dimacrocaryon
amphileptoides amphileptoides with the transmission electron microscope. The result was negative,
i.e., the cilia look the same as those of other ciliates (Figs 9g, h). This matches the scanning electron
microscopical investigations in more than 10 species (this monograph): they show only ordinary cilia.
Thus, the problem remains unsolved.
1.7.3 Ciliary Patterns (Figs 8a–h, 10)
Dileptids are strongly asymmetric. Thus, both a ventral and a dorsal side as well a right and a left side can
be distinguished. However, the boundaries are indistinct because all ciliary rows are alike. We suggest to
designate as somatic kinety 1 that row which bears the perioral kinety anteriorly (Fig. 8a).
Two basic ciliary patterns occur in the somatic ciliature of the dileptids: the tracheliid and the dileptid

pattern, differing only in the presence vs. absence of a ventrolateral “fossa”, a concavity with specialized
ciliature. The fossa, whose function is not known, occurs only in Trachelius and Apotrachelius (Figs 44w,
x, 46j, 47d, f, t).
The dileptids have a simple, holotrichous (~ complete) ciliature composed of, basically, two types of cilia:
ordinary ones and dorsal bristles. The ordinary cilia form rows (kineties) composed of serially arranged
monokinetids (= single, ciliated basal bodies). Usually, the rows are equidistant and extend meridionally
from the circumoral kinety to the posterior body end, where they are more or less shortened, depending
on the presence vs. absence of a tail (Figs 8a, b). See Figure 10 for the description of spacing of ciliary
rows.
The cilia within the rows are densely, ordinarily, or loosely spaced (Fig. 10). Usually, they are more densely
spaced orally than postorally. Frequently, the kineties contain some dikinetid-like kinetids, especially in
the middle third. The posterior basal body of these pairs is ciliated, while the anterior is bare. Likely, the
anterior kinetids are a reservoir for growing and/or dividing cells.
This basic pattern is modified not only by the dorsal brush, which will be described in the next section,
but also by the proboscis that produces a staggered pattern on the right side and a blank stripe on the left.
The right side pattern is caused by the gradual reduction of the width of the proboscis and the length of the
ciliary rows from proximal to distal, where the rows abut on the unshortened perioral kinety. Depending
on species, the staggered pattern is pronounced when the ciliary rows become gradually shorter along the
whole length of the proboscis (Fig. 8a) or inconspicuous when shortening occurs only in the distal region
of the proboscis (Fig. 8c). The blank stripe on the left side of the proboscis is caused by length reduction
of some or all left side ciliary rows, which then commence (or end) at level of the oral bulge opening (Figs
8b, d, h). Depending on the number of shortened ciliary rows and the width of the proboscis, the blank
stripe is narrow or wide. So, a variety of patterns is produced, especially in the genus Pseudomonilicaryon
(Figs 107, 108). The taxonomic significance of these patterns is not known but we would be not surprised
if molecular studies suggest that some characterize new genera or subgenera.
1.7.4 Dorsal Brush (Figs 10–12)
The anterior region of some dorsal and/or left lateral ciliary rows is modified to the so-called “dorsal
brush” or, simply, “brush”, first impregnated by gelei (1934). The area consists of specialized, narrowly to
widely spaced mono- and dikinetids with bristle-like cilia usually distinctly shorter than ordinary somatic
cilia. The function of the brush is not known.
At first glance, the dorsal brush looks rather similar in all dileptids, except for the number of rows. However,
the investigations of Foissner et al. (2002), Vďačný & Foissner (2008b), and the present monograph show
a considerable diversity, not only in the number of brush rows but also in other features, such as the spacing
and shape of the bristles. Unfortunately, the dorsal brush is difficult to investigate because the bristles are
usually small and narrowly spaced. Thus, a combination of live observation, protargol impregnation, and
scanning electron microscopy is ideal. In vivo, one must take care to have viable specimens because the
bristles are fragile and thus change shape easily.
A variety of brush features is used to characterize and distinguish species. Most are shown in Figures
10–12, and thus will be mentioned only briefly. The dorsal brush can be short (longest row ≤ 15% of body
length in protargol preparations), ordinary (15–35%), or long (≥ 35% of body length). The individual
brush rows may be of similar length (isostichad) or of different length (heterostichad), or of very different
length (distinctly heterostichad). Usually, the dorsal brush is isomorphic, that is, composed of bristles
throughout; rarely, it is heteromorphic, that is, mixed with ordinary cilia (Fig. 11). Furthermore, the brush
rows may be staggered and the dikinetids narrowly, ordinarily, or widely spaced. Six main types of brush

type II bristles in the middle portion of the brush: the anterior bristle is clavate and about 1.5 µm long, while the posterior one
is stump-like and 0.5 µm long; e, f, h – Pseudomonilicaryon angustistoma has three types of bristles: type III bristles are rod-
shaped and of similar length or the anterior bristle is shorter (1.3–1.5 μm) than the posterior one (2.5–3.8 μm); the anterior bristle
of type V is strongly inflated and 1.3 μm long, while the posterior bristle is conical and about 0.5 μm long; type VI tail bristles
are monokinetidal and 0.5 μm long; g, i – an undescribed Dileptus from Botswana has type V and VI bristles, the latter forming
monokinetidal tails. C – ordinary cilia, B I–VI – types of brush bristles.
20

bristles can be distinguished, ranging from stumps to strongly inflated bristles (Figs 11, 12). The individual
brush rows usually commence with dikinetids at anterior dorsal body end; rarely, they have an “anterior
tail” of ordinary cilia or bristles, e.g., in Dileptus sphagnicola (Figs 86t, u). At the posterior end of each
brush row, there is usually a “posterior tail”, i.e., a more or less long portion with short (≤ 3 µm) bristles
(Figs 12c, i). At the proximal end of the brush, the rows continue as ordinary somatic kineties and extend
to the posterior end of the cell. Only some of these features are presently used for species recognition
because their taxonomic value is poorly known. However, the data available indicate a considerable value,
and thus the brush description should be as detailed as possible.
See section on ontogenesis, for the origin and development of the dorsal brush during cell division.
1.8 Silverline Pattern (Figs 8g, 115k–n, 117f–l)
As in all haptorids, the dileptids basically have a very narrowly meshed silverline pattern with polygonal
meshes 0.5–2 µm in size (Fig. 8g). However, the dileptids are possibly unique in that the silverline pattern
is irregularly meshed also in the brush area (Figs 115n, 117f), where it usually assumes a platyophryid
pattern, that is, consists of comparatively ordered and large meshes divided by a median silverline extending
between two brush rows each (Foissner 1984, Foissner & Xu 2007). Thus, we were surprised to discover
a dileptid with another pattern, i.e., Pseudomonilicaryon fraterculum, which has a platyophryid silverline
pattern in the right side of the proboscis (Figs 115k, l, 117g, j, l). We do not know the significance of this
observation because very few dileptids have been investigated for their silverline pattern. However, we
know that Apodileptus visscheri does not have a platyophryid pattern, indicating that it is a feature of large
species or of a special group of species.
1.9 Oral Apparatus
1.9.1 Light Microscopic Structure and Terminology (Figs 13–15)
We summarized the oral structures that are important for light microscopical species identification in
Figures 13–15. These are: the shape and size of the oral bulge opening, the shape of the oral basket, the
arrangement of the extrusomes, and details of the ciliary patterns. We distinguish two regions in the oral
bulge: the proboscis oral bulge (that portion which is on the proboscis) and the oral bulge opening, which
is at the proximal end of the proboscis oral bulge and opens the oral basket when prey is engulfed (Fig.
15). See Figure 13 for shape and length classification of the proboscis.
1.9.2 General and Fine Structure (Figs 14–16, 17a, b)
The location and structure of the dileptid oral apparatus differ significantly from those of other haptorid
ciliates in that the oral bulge is bipartite (see above) and the ciliary pattern shows three (vs. one) kinds of
kineties: the circumoral kinety, the perioral kinety(ies), and the preoral kineties (Fig. 14). For literature,
see figure explanations.
The oral bulge is a more or less distinct, convex zone without cilia on the ventral side of the proboscis;
usually, it is more distinct around the oral bulge opening (Fig. 15). The bulge is not only horizontally
bipartite (see above) but also vertically due to the so-called central fibre, which divides the bulge in a
broad right branch and a narrow left branch. In most but not all species, only the right branch contains
extrusomes (Figs 16b–e). The surface of the bulge is more or less striated by the transverse microtubule
ribbons originating from the non-ciliated basal bodies of the circumoral kinety; they form, by overlapping
of their proximal region, the bulge’s central fibre (Figs 15b, 16b–d).
The oral (pharyngeal) basket is at the proximal end of the proboscis oral bulge. Although the basket is
comparatively small, dileptids can engulf large prey either by disintegrating it outside the cell (see next

the left branch by many slightly to strongly oblique preoral kineties, which became linearly arranged in Monilicaryon, producing

chapter) or by opening the oral bulge/basket widely. Typical examples are Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides
(Fig. 57c), Microdileptus breviproboscis (Figs 79j–l, 80l, m), and the planktonic dileptids (Figs 137i,
140i). The oral basket is a rather complex structure produced by three elements (Figs 14, 16a–d, 17a,
b): the external basket is formed by thick microtubule bundles (nematodesmata) originating from the
nonciliated basal bodies around the oral opening; the internal basket is produced by small bundles of bulge
microtubules held together by a fibrous ring distally; and the oral opening s. str. is lined by the proximal
portion of the transverse microtubule ribbons, originating from the nonciliated basal bodies around the
oral opening.
The circumoral kinety extends along the base of the oral bulge and is composed of narrowly to very
narrowly spaced, paired basal bodies (dikinetids), forming a single keyhole-shaped ciliary row (Figs 14–
16). However, this plesiomorphic state is present only in the Tracheliida, while the Dileptida show an
apomorphic condition, where the ciliated basal body of the pairs is reduced around the oral bulge opening.
The dikinetids are obliquely arranged, and only the more anteriorly located basal body of a pair is ciliated,
producing – together with the perioral kinety – a dense ciliation (“mane”), showing nice metachronal
ciliary waves (Fig. 72f). The circumoral kinety is interrupted at the distal end of the proboscis, where
the right branch curves left almost touching the straight left branch. Proximally, the circumoral kinety is
confluent with the nonciliated basal bodies surrounding the base of the oral bulge opening. The posterior
(or left) basal bodies of the dikinetids are bare but associated with transverse microtubule bundles, forming
the proboscis’ central fibre and lining the oral opening s. str. Furthermore, the nonciliated basal bodies are
associated with nematodesmata producing the external oral basket (Figs 16a–d).
The perioral kinety extends right of the right branch of the circumoral kinety, i.e., along the proboscis
proximal to which it continues as an ordinary somatic kinety (Fig. 14). It is composed of ordinarily to
very narrowly spaced monokinetids with few special fine structural characteristics (Figs 16b–d). Thus, the
perioral kinety is a somatic kinety with a condensed anterior portion. Usually, there is one perioral kinety,
two occur only in the euplanktonic genera Pelagodileptus and Paradileptus (Fig. 14).
The preoral kineties extend obliquely along the left branch of the circumoral kinety and contribute to
species recognition (Figs 13, 14). Usually, each kinety consists of only two to four kinetids with a fine
structure similar to that of the somatic kinetids, except for the fibrillar associates, which are rotated counter-
clockwise by about 120° (Figs 16c, d). The preoral kineties are ciliated and thus contribute to the dense
ciliature of the proboscis.
1.9.3 Food and Feeding (Figs 18a–i)
Dileptids are predators and have a similar food spectrum as other rapacious ciliates (lynn 2008).
Specifically, they feed on amoebas, flagellates, ciliates, and even on microscopic metazoans, such as
rotifers, planarians, and larvae of copepods. Bacteria, diatoms (e.g., Nitzschia palea, N. sigmoidea,
Synedra ulna, Cymbella sp., Rhoicosphenia curvata) and other algae found in food vacuoles are possibly
remnants from prey, although heterotrophic (Chilomonas) and autotrophic (Euglena) flagellates are
engulfed in laboratory experiments (Visscher 1923). The menu of the individual species is often much
shorter than listed above, and some are likely specialists. For instance, Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides
and D. brasiliense prefer testate amoebas (e.g., Euglypha sp., Schoenbornia viscicula, Trinema lineare),
Microdileptus microstoma and M. breviproboscis favour naked amoebas, Trachelius ovum feeds mostly
on peritrichs, and Pseudomonilicaryon japonicum prefers rotifers.
Visscher (1923) and Dragesco (1962) reviewed the literature and performed very interesting experiments
on feeding in Dileptus margaritifer (Fig. 18). Both agree that the toxicysts play a major role in prey
capture and lysis which mostly occurs outside the cell, i.e., the prey is ingested in fluid form. However,

For further explanation, see text. a1–8 – effect of toxicysts of Dileptus on rotifers, b1–7 – when Dileptus comes in
contact with Spirostomum (b1), the latter contracts vigorously and remains momentarily motionless (b2). Cytolysis
begins at area of contact (b3) and as Spirostomum reacts negatively, swimming rapidly away, the cytolytic process
continues (b4–6). Meanwhile, Dileptus has engulfed one or more masses of the disintegrating Spirostomum (b5–7);

the proboscis, toxicysts are released and immobilize the prey (1, 2). The proboscis continues moving, while the
prey rapidly disintegrates and the oral opening widens (3) to engulf the Colpidium debris (4); g1–4 – after partial
immobilization of the prey, Dileptus commences ingestion (1). When three quarters of the prey were inside the
predator (2, 3), a second Dileptus attacked the protruding prey portion (4); h1–8 – detailed analysis of feeding of D.
margaritifer on Colpidium campylum. The proboscis touches and kills the prey with the toxicysts (1). Then, prey
lyses and widening of the predator’s oral basket commences (2). Now, the proboscis moves away from the prey and
the widened proboscis oral bulge moves forward, eventually touching the lysed prey (3–5). When engulfing the lysed
prey, the oral basket opens trumpet-like (6). Then, the basket begins to close, forming the food vacuole (7, 8). These
processes require the following times (seconds): opening of the oral basket (3), prey ingestion (2), closing of the oral
basket (1.5). Further, a starved Dileptus can ingest 70 Colpidium within 2h. i1–4 – when Tetrahymena patula touches
the proboscis, it becomes cytolyzed immediately (1). Then, the proboscis encages the lysed prey (2) and transports
it to the widely open oral basket (3), where it is vigorously engulfed (4).

Microdileptus breviproboscis (Figs 79j–l) and sometimes also Dileptus margaritifer (Figs 18g1–g4) engulf
large prey whole. It is not known what determines whether prey is or is not lysed before ingestion.
Visscher (1923) concludes: (i) D. margaritifer normally feeds on living organisms, but under certain
conditions it ingests inanimate particles; (ii) it discriminates between living organisms and inanimate
substances, ingesting the former in large amounts, while the latter are only sparingly ingested; (iii)
Dileptus selects from among different kinds of organisms, eating some with great readiness, while others
are rarely ingested; (iv) it captures its prey by means of toxicysts which either paralyze the prey, e.g.,
Euglena, or bring about cytolysis of all or part of the protoplasm of the prey, e.g., Colpidium and Stentor;
(v) the toxicysts are probably of a liquid nature, highly toxic, with specific cytolytic properties; (vi) the
toxicysts of Dileptus are used for the purpose of capturing food; (vii) selection of food in Dileptus depends
on two factors: (a) the physiological state of the organism itself, which appears to determine whether a
substance shall be ingested in large or small amounts, and (b) the chemical properties of its toxicysts,
which determine in large measure whether any living organism can or can not be successfully captured;
(viii) specialized structures as, for example, the trichocysts of Paramecium and the pellicle of Euplotes,
serve as protection against the attacks of Dileptus.
Dragesco (1962) basically confirms the results of Visscher (1923) and adds the following: (i) Dileptus
shows very low food specialization but there can be two or three physiological races within a spesies, for
instance, in D. margaritifer; (ii) the prey, which is killed by the extruded toxicysts, is ingested rapidly
using two mechanisms: opening of the mouth and strong aspiration, both mechanisms are, however,
insufficiently known; (iii) the movement of the proboscis is independent from ingestion, and the cell can
kill ciliate prey without absorbing it. On the other hand, it can ingest prey without killing it before (D.
margatitifer can kill a zooid of Carchesium but half of the prey is taken by another predator).
Further details were added by miller (1968), who recognized that feeding of D. margaritifer begins
shortly before dawn and continues until bright day light, terminating sharply between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m.
Moreover, he could clarify proboscis truncation as a reaction to extensive feeding.
estèVe (1982) showed cannibalism of trypsin-treated conspecifics. Further, estèVe (1984) proved that
phagocytosis is calcium-dependent and probably regulated by calmodulin and glucose and/or mannose
residues. Ultrastructural changes included a local differentiation of the glycocalyx, an interaction between
cilia of prey and predator membrane and some fibrillar links between cytostomal vesicles and microtubules
of transverse fibres. The pharyngeal cytoplasm, which forms the membrane of the food vacuoles, is very
prominent (Fauré-Fremiet 1961). See Verni & gualtieri (1997) for a general review on feeding.
Prey ciliates evolved two defence strategies against dileptid predators: chemical defence by toxic granules,
e.g., the pigment granules of Stentor coeruleus (terazima et al. 1999, miyake et al. 2001), and mechanical
defence, in that the prey releases trichocysts propelling it away from Dileptus (knoll et al. 1991, 1993),
while backward swimming is of minor importance (harumoto 1994). When potential prey, e.g., Colpidium
kleini, is added to cultures of Dileptus margaritifer, it does not show any morphological changes (FyDa
& wiąckowski 1998). However, this must not be generalized. Euplotes, e.g., transforms into the “winged
state” when Dileptus margaritifer is present (görtz et al. 1999, kuhlmann et al. 1999).
1.10 Regeneration
Ewald schilD (1921), an Austrian amateur microscopist, was possibly the first who performed regeneration
experiments on Dileptus. He showed that pieces of D. margaritifer degenerated when they did not contain
nuclear material; this was confirmed by golińska & grain (1969). Later, more detailed experiments
showed that Dileptus is an interesting model for regeneration experiments. We will not go into details
because some excellent reviews are available (sokoloFF 1924, grain & Bohatier 1977, Frankel 1989),
30

and the data are of minor importance for taxonomic purposes. However, it is important to know of the
great regeneration capacity of dileptids because regenerating specimens occur rather frequently in nature,
especially, when the fragile proboscis whose regeneration needs about 5 h (golińska & kink 1976) has
been lost. And certainly the cell shape changes greatly in regenerating fragments and post-divisional
specimens (Figs 20l–g, 21a–m, 113a–r).
2 Life Cycle
The dileptids have an ordinary life cycle (Fig. 19). The excysted cells feed and become vegetative cells
that divide and eventually encyst when environmental conditions become adverse. The sexual life cycle is
known only in two dileptids, viz., Dileptus margaritifer (Visscher 1927, VinnikoVa 1974a) and Rimaleptus
tirjakovae (Vďačný & Foissner 2008a). The data show that there is one or several preconjugational
divisions, causing conjugants to be smaller than vegetative cells. Exconjugants feed and divide obtaining
vegetative size after some days.
2.1 Ontogenesis
Data on binary fission of dileptids have been reported for Apodileptus visscheri, Dileptus anatinus, D.
jonesi, D. margaritifer, Pseudomonilicaryon anser (Jones 1951; golińska 1972, 1995; Bohatier & kink
1977), and Trachelius ovum (hamBurger 1903, PenarD 1922) as well as for three Paradileptus species:
P. conicus, P. elephantinus, and P. ovalis (huBer-Pestalozzi 1945, FryD-VersaVel et al. 1975). However,
most of these studies are very incomplete, providing only a single stage and/or a few schematic figures
or micrographs. The exceptions are the detailed investigations of golińska (1972, 1995), who studied
mainly the formation of the opisthe’s infraciliature, using transmission electron microscopy and protargol
impregnation. However, golińska did not provide detailed line drawings of the process. These were
given only recently by Vďačný & Foissner (2009), who studied concomitantly development of cell shape,
nuclear apparatus, and ciliary pattern of Monomacrocaryon terrenum, using protargol impregnation. The
results of this study are reported here in the original wording. golińska & Jerka-DziaDosz (1973) showed
that division of D. margaritifer needs a certain volume of endoplasm, i.e., a certain size of the cell. See
golińska (1979, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988), Jerka-DziaDosz & golińska (1977), and Frankel (1989)
for the regulation of the ciliary pattern.
Division mode. Fission is homothetogenic, i.e., the posterior end of the proter is in contact with the
anterior end of the opisthe. Division occurs in freely motile (non-encysted) condition. Stomatogenesis is
holotelokinetal, that is, all somatic kineties proliferate circumoral kinetids. The parental oral apparatus and
dorsal brush are not reorganized.
Body changes and development of proboscis. Very early dividers are longer than morphostatic specimens
by an average of about 30 μm, while body width and the ratio of body and proboscis length hardly change
(~ 31% vs. 34%; Table 3). Thus, early dividers are the largest and most slender cells because they are
longer (322 μm vs. 278 μm), but not significantly wider than morphostatic specimens (50 μm vs. 48 μm;
Fig. 20l). In contrast to spathidiids, there are neither a slight indentation in the prospective fission area or
division blebs. In mid-dividers, when the macronucleus condenses, the body shortens and broadens from
322 × 50 μm to 303 × 56 μm, i.e., these cells are the smallest and stoutest dividers (Figs 20m, n). At this
stage, a minute bare protuberance, the precursor of the oral bulge, develops along the prospective anterior
end of the opisthe, dividing the cell into a conical posterior daughter shorter by about one fifth than the
broad proter (Figs 20g, h, m, n). In late mid-dividers, a remarkable process commences, i.e., the proboscis
bud develops as a small convexity in the opisthe’s brush area underneath the developing division furrow

a Very early dividers are characterized by the proliferation of basal bodies in the dorsal kineties slightly posterior to mid-body, while early dividers
have developed oral kinetofragments. Mid-dividers have a continuous circumoral kinety and the macronucleus commences condensation. Late
dividers have a dumbbell-shaped macronucleus, while it is divided into two pieces connected by a fibrous strand in very late dividers.

(Fig. 20o, arrow). In late dividers, the bud becomes more distinct due to the body’s constriction which
occurs in a dorsoventral gradient (Figs 20p, q). Slightly before separation, the daughter cells are connected
with the broadly rounded posterior end of the proter and the developing oral opening of the opisthe (Figs
20i–k, q). Very early post-divisional opisthes have a characteristic triangular shape because the parental
acute posterior body third is maintained and the proboscis extends along the anterior body end hardly
projecting dorsally, resembling the oral bulge of “polar” haptorids (Fig. 21j). Late opisthe post-dividers
have a considerably shorter proboscis (50 μm vs. 94 μm) and a shorter (170 μm vs. 280 μm) and stouter
body (4.0:1 vs. 5.9:1) than morphostatic cells. Thus, post-divisional development is associated with intense
growth and stretching of the proboscis, first providing the body with a spatulate (Fig. 21a) and then with
a dileptid appearance (Figs 21k–m). In contrast, post-divisional proters are rather similar to morphostatic
specimens because no changes occur in the parental oral apparatus, the somatic ciliature, and the dorsal
brush. However, they are easily distinguished from morphostatic cells by the broadly rounded posterior
end (vs. acute posterior third; Figs 21f–i). Further, they differ from morphostatic cells by the shorter (~
208 μm vs. 280 μm) and stouter body (4.4:1 vs. 5.9:1) as well as by the proportion of body and proboscis
length (46% vs. 34%), while the length of the proboscis (95 μm vs. 94 μm) is quite similar (Table 3).
Thus, the proter post-divisional development is associated mainly with intense growth and patterning of
the trunk.
Stomatogenesis. Stomatogenesis of dileptids includes three main processes: the production of the
circumoral and perioral kinety as well as of the preoral kineties. The anarchic fields, which will become
circumoral kinetofragments, are generated in all somatic kineties during the first round of basal body
proliferation, while the perioral and preoral kinetofragments are formed during the second round which
occurs only in the right lateral and dorsal kineties, respectively (Fig. 23c).
Development of circumoral kinety and oral basket. Division commences with the production of basal
bodies in the dorsal kineties slightly posterior to mid-body, making the proter longer than the opisthe by a
ratio of 1.3:1 (Table 3). Later on, proliferation of basal bodies commences in the ventral kineties slightly
posterior to the level of the dorsal region, resulting in a slightly oblique division furrow (Figs 20a, b).
The newly produced basal bodies form minute anarchic fields following a dorso-ventral gradient (Figs
20a, b, arrowheads); then they arrange transversely to the main body axis (Figs 20a, c), forming short
circumoral kinetofragments which grow and unite with the fragments from the other kineties to generate
the circumoral kinety (Figs 20a–c). Interestingly, the circumoral kinetofragments originating from the
right and left as well as the dorsal kineties are composed of dikinetids (Figs 20a–c), while those produced
by the ventral kineties consist of monokinetids (Fig. 20d). This peculiarity leads to the composite character
of the circumoral kinety: oral dikinetids in the proboscis, while oralized somatic monokinetids around the
oral opening.
The new oral opening and oral basket become distinct in late dividers. The nematodesmata of the external
basket originate exclusively from the basal bodies of the monokinetidal part of the circumoral kinety, while
the rods of the internal basket, which is possibly formed by transverse microtubule arrays originating from
the oralized somatic monokinetids, seem to be embedded in the cytoplasm surrounding the developing
oral opening (Figs 20i–k).
Development of perioral kinety. On the right side, the anterior portion of about seven opisthe ciliary
rows elongates by a second round of basal body proliferation (Fig. 20a, asterisks) and curves dorsally
along the growing circumoral kinetofragments (Figs 20b, e). Later on, the curved portions detach from
the ciliary rows – except for the ventralmost ciliary row which is thus continuous with the perioral kinety
in morphostatic specimens – and fuse to a continuous perioral kinety with narrowly spaced basal bodies
(Figs 20g, h, j). This process begins in mid-dividers (specimens with condensed macronucleus) and is
34

completed in very late dividers or post-divisionally, as evident from small irregularities and/or ciliary
rows still connected to the new perioral kinety (Fig. 21a, arrowheads). In post-dividers, the perioral kinety
elongates concomitantly with proboscis growth by intrakinetal proliferation of basal bodies.
Development of preoral kineties. During the second round of basal body proliferation, rather long
preoral kinetofragments are produced in the anterior portion of about six dorsal kineties (Fig. 20e). In
mid-dividers, the individual kinetofragments split into about four minute portions, each consisting of two
to three kinetids, which migrate rightwards to form the preoral kineties (Fig. 20f, asterisks). Taking the
averages of split short rows (4) and the ciliary rows producing fragments (6), there are about 24 preoral
kineties, which is half the number found in morphostatic cells (Table 3). Thus, half of the preoral kineties

dorso-ventral gradient. The new oral dikinetids form minute anarchic fields (arrowheads) which develop to kinetofragments
producing the circumoral kinety. A second round of basal body production in the anterior region of the opisthe’s right side kineties
generates the monokinetidal perioral kinetofragments. During this process, dikinetid-like kinetids are recognizable (asterisks)
which, however, are just divided basal bodies. The productive portion, where basal bodies become very narrowly spaced, curves
dorsally (b) and separates from the ciliary rows to form the perioral kinety (see Figs 20e and 20g); c, d – the oral kinetofragments
are dikinetidal on the dorsal side, while monokinetidal on the ventral side; they are arranged transversely to the opisthe’s ciliary
rows, forming a T-shaped pattern. CK – circumoral kinety, KF – circumoral kinetofragments, PEK – perioral kinetofragments,

are generated post-divisionally during growth of the proboscis, possibly by proliferation of the existing
preoral kineties or by migrating kinetids from the anterior end of those somatic kineties which terminate
at the base of the proboscis (Fig. 21e).
Development of somatic ciliature and dorsal brush. The mature ciliary pattern of dileptids develops
post-divisionally and includes three specific processes in middle-sized and large species: (1) the formation
of a suture along the right branch of the circumoral kinety; (2) the formation of a barren stripe along
the left branch of the circumoral kinety; and (3) the formation of a staggered dorsal brush. The two first
36

peculiarities may be inconspicuous or even absent in small species with less than 10 ciliary rows (see
Pseudomonilicaryon brachyproboscis).
The formation of the right side suture occurs in that only the more dorsally located kineties extend to
the tip of the proboscis, while the more ventrally extending kineties are gradually shortened (Figs 21a, b
asterisks). The barren stripe along the left branch of the circumoral kinety originates in a similar way, i.e.,
some kineties left of the oral opening do not elongate (Fig. 23a).
The formation of the dorsal brush and the staggered arrangement of the brush rows is a complex process.
In late mid-dividers, a third round of basal body proliferation produces the dikinetidal dorsal brush. This
is an intense process which occurs in the six or seven dorsal ciliary rows that have produced the preoral
kineties (Figs 20g, h). Initially, all brush rows abut to the newly formed preoral kineties and thus do not
have a staggered pattern (Fig. 20h). In this stage, the opisthe’s dorsal brush occupies a rather large, convex
area because the interkinetal distance between the brush rows is only slightly smaller than that between
ordinary ciliary rows (Figs 20g, h). In late dividers and post-dividers, the elongation of the proboscis
causes a decrease of the interkinetal distances (Fig. 20i) and the staggered pattern of the brush rows in
that the rows gradually elongate from ventral to dorsal (Figs 21c–e). A distinct increase of the number of
brush dikinetids occurs only in late post-dividers, where basal bodies with short bristles and non-ciliated
dikinetids appear in the posterior region of the brush (Figs 21c, d). Now, the entire dorsal surface of the
proboscis is covered with brush kinetids and the number of dikinetids increases from an average of 34 (n
= 4) in early post-dividers to 56 in morphostatic cells (Table 3).
Nuclear division. In very early dividers, the macronucleus is still highly similar to that of morphostatic
cells, i.e., it is cylindroidal, more or less curved, and 84 μm long on average (Table 3). Later on, the
macronucleus elongates to an average length of 100 μm and becomes S- or U-shaped (Fig. 20l). In mid-
dividers, the macronucleus condenses to a globular, homogenously impregnated mass about 50 μm across
(Figs 20m, n). When the proboscis bud appears, the macronucleus begins to divide, becoming dumbbell-
shaped (Fig. 20o). Then, the dividing macronucleus extends to a long rod constricting in the fission area
(Fig. 20p). When cell fission is finishing, the macronucleus is divided into two oblong pieces connected
with their pointed ends (Fig. 20q). After cell fission, the macronucleus elongates and migrates to mid-body
(Figs 21f–m).
During the first stages of ontogenesis, the micronucleus increases in size from an average of 3.6 μm to
6.3 μm (Table 3). When the macronucleus is condensed to a globular mass, the micronucleus begins to
divide becoming dumbbell-shaped, with the narrowly cuneate halves connected by a fibre bundle (Fig.
20n). Later on, the bundle conspicuously elongates and the daughter’s micronuclei become globular and
homogenously impregnated (Fig. 20o). In very late dividers, the micronuclei achieve the species-specific
size (4 μm across), but are still connected by a long fibre (Fig. 20p). During post-divisional cell growth,
the micronucleus moves to mid-macronucleus (Figs 21h, j, k, m).
In Dileptus margaritifer, the macronuclear nodules divide individually, showing longitudinally oriented
microtubules that penetrate the nucleolus, which disintegrates into long strains. The macronuclear

Dileptid division mode. The ontogenesis of Monomacrocaryon terrenum basically agrees with data
from other dileptids, all displaying the following events: (i) cell division occurs in active (non-encysted)
condition; (ii) the macronucleus is homomeric; (iii) stomatogenesis is holotelokinetal (all ciliary rows
produce kinetofragments) and the parental oral apparatus does not reorganize; (iv) small anarchic fields
are formed on the top of the broken ciliary rows and develop into circumoral kinetofragments growing and
uniting to the circumoral kinety; (v) the perioral kinety is formed by the alignment of the densely ciliated
anterior region of the right side ciliary rows; (vi) the preoral kineties are produced by splitting of the

anterior region of the dorsal ciliary rows into several minute portions which migrate rightwards along the
circumoral kinety; (vii) the dorsal brush develops very late, i.e., after the production of the preoral kineties
in late mid-dividers; and (viii) the proboscis basically matures post-divisionally.
Some variation occurs in the dileptid division, just as in spathidiids (Foissner & Xu 2007). Main deviations
comprise: (i) the presence/absence of a transient indentation in the prospective fission area (present
in Pseudomonilicaryon brachyproboscis, absent in Monomacrocaryon terrenum); (ii) the presence/
absence of macronucleus condensation in mid-dividers (the nodules fuse to a mass in P. brachyproboscis,
while they divide individually, for instance, in Dileptus jonesi); and (iii) size and shape changes of the
micronucleus during early division (the micronucleus shows a two-fold size increase but no shape changes
in M. terrenum, while it becomes globular due to width increase in P. brachyproboscis). For further details
on modes of nuclear division in dileptids, see Fig. 22.
Comparative ontogenesis. Ontogenesis of dileptids is much more complex than in other litostomateans,
displaying many peculiarities and reaching a complexity comparable to that found in “higher” ciliates.
A most interesting feature is the three rounds of basal body proliferation, while the majority of ciliates
displays usually only one round (Figs 23c, d; Foissner 1996a). In dileptids, the circumoral kinetofragments
are formed via small anlagen fields (golińska 1995, Vďačný & Foissner 2009), a widespread mode
among ciliates but as yet not found in other litostomateans (Foissner 1996a). Further, the circumoral
kinetofragments of dileptids are transversely arranged from the beginning of their formation, while they
are longitudinally oriented when formed and then rotate clockwise to become horizontally arranged in
spathidiids (Foissner & Xu 2007). Interestingly, a similar process occurs during the formation of the
perioral kinety. A further peculiarity of Dileptus ontogenesis is the complex genesis of the circumoral kinety:
the ventral kinetofragments are composed of oralized somatic monokinetids, while the kinetofragments
originating from lateral and dorsal kineties are composed of oral dikinetids (golińska 1995, Vďačný &
Foissner 2009). On the other hand, the circumoral kinetofragments of ordinary haptorids are exclusively
dikinetidal (Foissner 1996a), except for the Enchelyina which lack oral dikinetids at all (Foissner &
Foissner 1988a). Unlike all haptorids investigated so far (Berger et al. 1983, Foissner 1996a, Foissner &
Xu 2007), dileptids develop the dorsal brush as the last ciliary structure, that is, in late mid-dividers.
At first glance, the complex ontogenesis of dileptids appears to be caused by the proboscis. However,
two observations suggest that this is only part of the truth, viz., the unique formation of the circumoral
kinetofragments and the late genesis of the dorsal brush. Both peculiarities are obviously independent of
spatial constraints and the presence/absence of a proboscis.
2.2 Sexual cycle
2.2.1 Serotypes
Recent molecular studies suggest a rapid diversification of mating systems in ciliates (PhaDke & zuFall
2009). There are three mating types in Dileptus margaritifer. Each type secrets its own gamons into the
cultural medium (aFon’kin & yuDin 1986). Detailed investigations showed a non-Mendelian inheritance,
suggesting that serotypes are under epigenetic control (yuDin & usPenskaya 2000, 2002).
aFon’kin (1991) made an interesting study on cell-cell recognition in Dileptus. Thus, we cite the summary
literally: “The number of homo- and heterotypic pairs marked with Chinese ink was registered during
conjugation of complementary clones of D. margaritifer. For each mating type both homo- and heterotypic
pairs were studied. At the early stage of the process, i.e., two hours after the mixing of the clones, all
three types of pairs (two homotypic and one heterotypic) were present in the mixture, their ratio being
approximately 1:2:1. Five to six hours after beginning the experiment heterotypic pairs predominated
42

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
in the mixtures. The homotypic pairs were formed in great number in mixtures of clones where one of
the mating types was represented by only a few cells, but they disintegrated later. It is suggested that the
formation of pairs is due to the expression of mating-type nonspecific adhesive molecules on the cell
surface. The complementary cells in pairs are assumed to continue to stimulate the expression of the
adhesines with their mating pheromones. The fact that heterotypic pairs appear to be more stable than
homotypic ones is ascribed to this hypothesis. The stimulation of expression of the hypothetical mating-
type nonspecific adhesines with heterotypic mating pheromones may be regarded as a mechanism that
prevents inbreeding in ciliates.”
2.2.2 Conjugation
hertwig (1904) and Visscher (1927) provided pioneer data on the conjugation of Dileptus margaritifer
(misidentified as D. gigas). Later, VinnikoVa (1974a, 1976) and golińska & aFon’kin (1993) studied

preparatory changes and nuclear divisions during conjugation of D. margaritifer and Pseudomonilicaryon
anser, using protargol impregnation and TEM. Only very recently, Vďačný & Foissner (2008a) studied
cell size and shape, nuclear changes, and the ciliary pattern during and after conjugation of Rimaleptus
tirjakovae. Their data basically agree with previous ones, especially, in that conjugation is temporary and
heteropolar, and partners unite bulge-to-bulge. However, differences occur in the number of micronuclei
undergoing maturation, in the number of synkaryon divisions, in the number of macronuclear anlagen, in the
number of degenerating synkaryon derivatives, and in pair separation with respect to nuclear development
(Table 4). Despite the curious body organization, dileptid conjugation is consistent with some previous
observations on didiniid, acaryophryid, and spathidiid haptorians (PranDtl 1906, serrano et al. 1990,
47

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
Xu & Foissner 2004). However, dileptids display massive changes in body shape and ciliary pattern,
causing early and late conjugants to resemble Spathidium, while mid-conjugants resemble Enchelyodon
or Protospathidium (Visscher 1927, Vďačný & Foissner 2008a).
For details on conjugation of Dileptus margaritifer, see that species. Conjugation and postconjugational
reorganization of Rimaleptus tirjakovae are reported here in full length.
Pair formation (Figs 24a, p). Only one pair was in a very early stage of pair formation, showing that the
partners are much smaller than vegetative cells (~ 105 × 13 μm vs. 210 × 20 μm). Further, all conjugating
specimens possess distinctly fewer ciliary rows (13 vs. 21), suggesting more than one preconjugational
division. Whether conjugation is isogamic or anisogamic is difficult to state due to the few pairs available.
Obviously, it is isogamic with respect to shape and morphology, while probably anisogamic with respect
to size because the average length ratio of the partners is 1.4:1 in the 15 pairs measured.
Pair formation is heteropolar, namely, the partners unite with the ventral side in such a way that the tip of
one proboscis is placed on the base of the other (Figs 24a, p). The right side of the unit area of one partner
faces the right side of the unit area of the other partner: thus the perioral kineties and the right branch of
the circumoral kinety are visible when the specimens are observed in the same focal plane (Figs 24p, s).
The union mode is ventral-to-dorsal in terms of the dorsal brush because the brush of only one partner is
visible when the pair is observed in the same focal plane (Figs 24q, r). The conjugants may form rod-like
or strongly arched pairs; no correlation between pair shape and progress through conjugation was found.
The onset of conjugation is associated with distinct body changes (Fig. 24a): (i) the proboscis shortens
by about 87% causing the cells first to become spatulate and then more or less fusiform; (ii) both the
internal and external oral baskets disintegrate and become smaller; and (iii) the number of contractile
vacuoles decreases. Conspicuous ciliary changes occur in connection with body diminution (Fig. 24p):
(i) the number of preoral kineties as well as perioral and dorsal brush kinetids distinctly decreases; (ii) the
anterior portion of the right side somatic kineties begins to curve dorsally; and (iii) the interkinetal distances
increase. Thus, early conjugants achieve a spathidiid appearance in body shape and ciliary pattern.
In very early conjugants, the vegetative macronuclear nodules lose their globular shape and commence
to fuse and to stretch. Furthermore, the micronucleus swells and shows fibrous structures, possibly
chromosomes (Fig. 24a). The food vacuoles disappear, making cells more transparent.
Maturation divisions and pronuclei (Figs 24b–d, q, 27). When the maturation divisions commence,
further body diminution occurs (i.e., from about 105 × 13 μm to about 60 × 17 μm) and conspicuous
changes in the length:width ratio occur, both as compared with the vegetative cells (about 3.6:1 vs. 10.6:1)
and the partners (2.9:1 in the shorter vs. 4.2:1 in the longer). The proboscis is reduced to a rounded
triangular lip (Fig. 24q): (i) the circumoral kinety, which is restricted to the ventral side in the vegetative
cells, extends now also along the dorsal side, and the oral dikinetids possibly assume a more vertical
orientation; (ii) there is a further decrease in the number of perioral kinetids; and (iii) the preoral kineties
may even be entirely resorbed. Eventually, the shape of maturating specimens becomes Enchelyodon- or
Protospathidium-like (i.e., resembles “polar” haptorids without proboscis; Figs 24b, c, q).
There are three maturation divisions. During the first division, the micronucleus swells from a diameter
of about 2.7 μm to 7–8 μm (Fig. 24a). The second division yields four globular maturation derivatives
that impregnate homogenously and slowly degenerate, except for one which enters the third maturation
division (Fig. 24b, arrows). The degenerating maturation derivatives impregnate more heavily than the
disintegrating macronucleus (Fig. 24d). The remaining maturation derivative moves into the anterior body
end and assumes a highly characteristic, fusiform shape during the prophase (Fig. 24b, arrows). Then,
the derivative begins to divide producing a conspicuous spindle (Fig. 24c), which is resorbed before the
48

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
synkaryon develops (Fig. 24d). One pronucleus becomes stationary, whilst the other migrates into the
partner to form the synkaryon (Figs 24d, e, 27).
Synkaryon formation and synkaryon divisions (Figs 24e–n, r, 27). No further changes occur in body
shape and ciliary pattern during synkaryon formation and the first synkaryon division (Fig. 24r). After
the first synkaryon division, the oral area commences to elongate to a spathidiid oral bulge (Figs 24i, j, l,
m). This is associated with conspicuous changes in the ciliary pattern (Fig. 24s): (i) the circumoral kinety
arranges around the ventral portion of the emerging proboscis; (ii) the number of perioral kinetids increases
at the base of the proboscis; and (iii) the anterior portion of the right side somatic kineties starts to curve
dorsally, highly resembling a spathidiid ciliary pattern. Thus, the enchelyodonid pattern, characteristic for
the maturating specimens, becomes spatulate.
A synkaryon each is formed in the partners by fusion of the migratory pronucleus with the stationary one
(Fig. 24e). The first synkaryon division follows pronuclear fusion and is characterized by an inflation of
the synkaryon and the appearance of at least 10 chromosomes attached to fibrous structures during the
metaphase (Figs 24f, g). The first synkaryon division generates two globular, abutting synkaryon derivatives
(Figs 24h, i), which stepwise divide mitotically (Figs 24j–l), producing four synkaryon derivatives in
each partner (Fig. 24n). The individual synkaryon derivatives are about 7 μm across and are covered by
a distinct membrane slightly separated from the nucleoplasm, which contains many faintly impregnated
granules. Finally, two synkaryon derivatives become macronuclear anlagen: one differentiates into the
micronucleus; and the last degenerates (Figs 24m, n). The degenerating vegetative macronucleus and the
maturation derivatives are still recognizable in some late conjugants (Figs 24k, m, 27).
Pair separation (Figs 24o, s). Slightly before separation, the partners form a rod-like structure connected
with the basal portion of the proboscides (Fig. 24o). Conjugants separate in the spathidiid stage after the
second synkaryon division, when the nuclear apparatus consists of two macronuclear anlagen and one
micronucleus in the vertex formed by these abutting anlagen. The resorption of the vegetative macronucleus
and maturation derivatives is now complete because they are absent from very late conjugants and early
exconjugants (Fig. 24o).
Exconjugant reorganization. In the absence of detailed data from cultures, we could not distinguish
with certainty between exconjugants and preconjugants. However, we could distinguish by morphometric
analysis (Table 5) early and mid-exconjugants and/or preconjugants from vegetative specimens by their
much smaller size (88 × 15 μm vs. 212 × 20 μm), the stouter body (~ 6:1 vs. 10.5:1), and by the distinctly
shorter proboscis (28 μm vs. 86 μm). Further, there were only 15 conjugation pairs among over 500 small
and very small supposed exconjugants, suggesting that we missed the peak of conjugation and thus also
preconjugation division(s).
The morphometric data show (Table 5) that postconjugational reorganization is associated with intense
proboscis and body growth (Figs 25a–h, 26a–k), as indicated by the body length:width ratio (6:1 in
exconjugants vs. ~ 4:1 in conjugating specimens). The reconstruction of the oral basket begins in late
conjugants (Figs 24i, l, m, o) and is completed soon after pair separation (Figs 24u, v, 25a, c, e, g).
Thus, the basket is relatively larger in the small exconjugants than in the large vegetative cells (Figs 25c,
n–r). The number of groups of excretory pores increases and they soon appear in the growing proboscis
(compare Fig. 25c with Fig. 25h). Many developing extrusomes, which impregnate heavily with protargol,
are scattered in the cytoplasm (Figs 25m, 26d) and possibly migrate into the proboscis where they lose
impregnability (see description of species). Subsequently, the exconjugants feed on medium-sized ciliates
to gather nutrients for further growth and reorganization (Figs 25s–w). The definitive body shape is
eventually regained in late exconjugants (Figs 26c, d, h–k), while reaching the vegetative body size needs
one or several postconjugational divisions.

Ciliary pattern. The general appearance and ciliary pattern of very early exconjugants resembles that of
Spathidium sensu lato due to the short, only slightly projecting proboscis. The very early exconjugants
have widely spaced somatic kinetids (Figs 25a, c, e, 26a), which proliferate throughout the kineties causing
late exconjugants to be ordinarily ciliated (Figs 26c, d). The number of ciliary rows remains unchanged
in conjugants and exconjugants (on average 13 and 14, respectively; Table 5), showing that the vegetative
number (on average 21) is regained during or after postconjugational division(s).
In very early exconjugants, the dorsal brush is rather inconspicuous and composed of only a few dikinetids
(Figs 25a, c, e, h). However, non-ciliated basal bodies or dikinetids do appear near the posterior end of the
parental remnants of the dorsal brush (Fig. 25c, arrows). They originate from either restructured somatic
kinetosomes or, more likely, de novo because almost the entire dorsal surface of the proboscis is covered
with paired and single brush bristles in late exconjugants (Figs 26c, d); however, their number is still much
lower than in vegetative cells.
The perioral kinety is preserved during conjugation but in a rather reduced state (Fig. 24s). During growth
of the proboscis, the perioral kinety elongates by intrakinetal proliferation of basal bodies until it attains
the vegetative appearance (Figs 25b, d, f, 26b). The oblique preoral kineties, which are usually composed
of two basal bodies, are entirely resorbed during conjugation (Figs 24q, r). Soon after pair separation
some monokinetids appear close to the left side oral dikinetids, forming a very loose kinety resembling
the right side perioral kinety (Figs 25a, c, e, g, 26a). Later, the number of preoral basal bodies increases
concomitantly with proboscis elongation (Fig. 26c), but the vegetative pattern is obtained only in late
exconjugants (Fig. 26d).
Fig. 27: Scheme of the nuclear processes during and after conjugation of Rimaleptus tirjakovae (from Vďačný & Foissner 2008a).
There are three maturation divisions and two synkaryon divisions, which produce four synkaryon derivatives, of which two
become macronuclear anlagen, one becomes the micronucleus, and one degenerates. The majority of exconjugants (83%) have
the vegetative macronuclear pattern (Table 6): two globular macronuclear nodules; rarely do the macronuclear nodules fuse to
a globular or ellipsoidal mass or undergo a further division producing four globular nodules. I, II, III – maturation divisions, 1,

Nuclear apparatus. Among 582 early exconjugants, about 83% have the vegetative macronuclear pattern
(i.e., two globular nodules; Figs 24t, 25a, c, i–m, 26e), 6.5% possess two ellipsoidal nodules (Fig. 26f),
6% have one ellipsoidal nodule (Figs 25n–p, r), 3% have one globular nodule (Figs 24u, v, 25e, q),
and only 1.5% have four nodules (Table 6). Thus, the macronuclear anlagen may fuse to a globular or
ellipsoidal mass or may occasionally undergo further division as is shown by exconjugants with four
globular nodules (Figs 26g, 27). The micronucleus is slightly larger in very early exconjugants than in late
ones, and is surrounded by a membrane, which is visible only soon after the separation of the conjugants,
i.e., in specimens with very short proboscis (Figs 24o, t). See karaDzhan (1985) for changes in the DNA
content of the macronuclear anlagen; possibly, there occurs diminution of the genetic material.
2.3 Encystment, Resting Cysts and Excystment
Comparatively little information is available on the dormant period of the dileptid life cycle. Generally,
food depletion/addition is a main stimulus for encystment/excystment (corliss & esser 1974, Foissner &
Xu 2007). This is supported by our observations since all resting cysts we studied during the preparation
of the monograph were obtained by maintaining isolated specimens without food in depression slides
with a small quantity of Eau de Volvic or centrifuged soil percolate. On the other hand, Jones (1951)
noted that gradual accumulation of Dileptus’ excretion products induced encystment in crowded cultures.
When he changed the medium constantly over a period of five days, the crowding per se did not result in
encystment. This indicates that the changing medium prevented the accumulation of excretion products
and hence encystment.
Encystment. This process was studied in only a few species, viz., in Trachelius ovum by FaBre-Domergue
(1891), Dileptus sp. by Prowazek (1904), D. jonesi (misidentified as D. anser) by Jones (1951), and
Apodileptus visscheri by kink (1973, 1978). However, Jones (1951) doubted several of Prowazek’s
observations. Firstly, Prowazek (1904) postulated that the cell takes up water during early stages of
encystment, causing the cytoplasm to become turbid. Actually, water is passed out of the cell, since
the encysting specimen has a much smaller volume than the precystic individual. Secondly, Prowazek
(1904) mentioned a plug by which the cyst is attached to the substrate (Fig. 28c). This is very unlikely in
Jones’ opinion, but the presence of a plug is supported by our recent observations on Pseudomonilicaryon
fraterculum. Thirdly, Prowazek (1904) noted a slight cyst wall depression that he considered to be derived
from the cytostome. This is unlikely in Jones’ and our opinion.
The most detailed study is that of kink (1978) on Apodileptus visscheri, using transmission electron
microscopy. She recognized four stages. During stage 1, when the cells are slightly thickened and the
proboscis is shortened, the oral and somatic cilia are displaced into the cell’s cytoplasm, while the
unciliated basal bodies of the circumoral kinety remain. The tela corticalis is disrupted at many places.
During stage 2, when the cells are rounded up and the proboscis is distinctly shortened, the resorption of
the ciliature proceeds and the cilia disintegrate in the cytoplasm without forming autophagous vacuoles.
The oral basket begins dedifferentiation, while the unciliated oral basal bodies appear unchanged. During
stage 3, when the body becomes globular and the proboscis disappears, the dedifferentiation of the oral
basket proceeds and masses of microfibrillar material appear in the pharyngeal region. During stage 4,
when the cells begin to form the cyst wall, ciliary decomposition is almost finished and the microfibrillar
aggregations described in stage 3 disappear. The nonciliated oral basal bodies are likely resorbed in situ
during stages 3 and 4.
All other reliable observations on encystment of dileptids can be summarized as follows: (i) cells entering
encystment show weak motility, slowly rotating on the spot; (ii) during the initial stages, the body
diminishes by about one half and becomes a more or less perfect sphere; (iii) the proboscis is put on the

28b); (iv) the contractile and food vacuoles disappear, causing the cytoplasm to become homogenous and
hyaline; (v) the ciliature is gradually resorbed, but without any topographical regularity, and is completely
lost after formation of the cyst wall; (vi) the nematodesmata of the oral basket form a single “relaxed”
bundle that is attached to the surface of the cell; (vii) according to Prowazek (1904), some of the many
macronuclear nodules degenerate and are resorbed, others are extruded between cell and cyst wall, and
the remaining nodules fuse into two or three masses (Figs 28c, e–g). According to Jones (1951) and kink
(1973), the macronuclear nodules decrease in size, become irregularly shaped and tightly spaced but do
not fuse; (viii) there is no micronuclear reorganization, but the chromatin of the micronuclei becomes
more condensed; (ix) the ectocyst (external cyst layer sensu Prowazek 1904 and kink 1973) is formed by
laying down extremely thin, colourless layers until a thickness of 2 to 7 µm is attained (Figs 28c, d); (x) a
2 µm thick pigmented mesocyst (internal cyst layer sensu Prowazek 1904 and kink 1973) is formed next
(Figs 28e–g); and (xi) the formation of an endocyst was not observed because it could not be seen in the
resting cyst due to the colour and thickness of the mesocyst (Jones 1951).
Resting cysts. Only few data are available on the morphological diversity of the dileptid resting cysts:
FaBre-Domergue (1891) studied cysts of Trachelius ovum, wenrich (1929) and huBer-Pestalozzi
(1945) of Paradileptus elephantinus, zacharias (1894) and huBer & niPkow (1927) of Pelagodileptus
trachelioides, kink (1973) of Apodileptus visscheri, and Foissner et al. (1995) of Dileptus margaritifer.
Thus, during the preparation of this monograph, we investigated the cyst of several further species. This
showed a comparatively high diversity, ranging from simple globes to cysts with a conspicuous escape
apparatus. As yet, we could distinguish six types (Fig. 29).
The ultrastructure of the resting cyst of Apodileptus visscheri was studied by kink (1973) in the TEM.
Her observations are very detailed and are thus cited here in full length: “The resting cysts of Dileptus
visscheri possess two envelopes: the external one (ectocyst), which originates earlier during encystment,
and an internal one (endocyst), which is formed later between the cell membrane and the external cyst
wall.
The external cyst wall of D. visscheri is built up from a fibrous material, loosely packed in concentric
strands. The inner cyst wall is also made from concentrically arranged fibrillar strands, but they are tightly
packed. The width of the wall is unequal on the circumference of the same cyst. During aging of the cyst,
the cytoplasm of the encysted ciliate gradually condenses and moves out from the inner envelope. Within
the space an amorphic material appears.
The cytoplasm is covered by the cell membrane, which is regularly folded. Under the cell membrane,
similarly as in trophonts, there are a layer of very small vesicles and microtubular fibrils, which probably
represent kinetosomal postciliary fibers.
In the superficial zone of the cytoplasm, occasionally some kinetosomes can be observed. They are rare
and irregularly arranged, what is in striking contrast to the trophic cell where they are precisely arranged
in kineties. The kinetosomes in the cysts are localized in different distances from the cell membrane, and
they probably do not contact the membrane. The kinetosomes are accompanied by microtubular fibres
which originate from the proximal end of the kinetosomes and extend towards the cell membrane. The
course of the fibrils indicates that they correspond to the transverse and postciliary fibers in trophonts. The
root fiber was not observed; most probably, it disappears during encystment. It was impossible to resolve
whether the kinetodesma persists in the cyst or not. No fibrils with a periodic structure were found.
From the fact that the kinetosomes bear transverse and postciliary fibers, it can be deduced that they
are remnants of the somatic ciliature or of the feeding cilia from the proboscis of the trophic cell. All
kinetosomes found in cysts are devoid of cilia. In cross sections no images of cilia were observed
55

either in the cytoplasm or within the space between the cell membrane and the cyst wall. This suggests
disappearance of the ciliature. Another possibility exists, namely that the cilia are resorbed before the cyst
walls are produced.
In the resting cysts of D. visscheri the microfibrillar layer, which forms the boundary between endo-
and ectoplasm in the trophic cells, completely disappears. In young cysts, strands of fibrillar material of
different size can be occasionally observed. The character of these fibrillar strands suggests that they are
remnants of the microfibrillar layer. They are arranged in different distances from the membrane. In old
cysts, no fibrillar strands were found.
The disappearance of the microfibrillar layer is accompanied by structural mixing of the ecto- and
endoplasmic components. The mucocysts, which represent typical ectoplasmic organelles in trophonts,
are scattered throughout the cytoplasm. They can be observed under the cyst surface, where they are
frequent in young cysts, as well as inside the cytoplasm, which in turn is typical for older cysts. Only
one kind of mucocysts was found in the encysted ciliates. All mucocysts were filled with electron-dense
material. Occasionally, a stripping of the mucocyst contents was seen.
The arrangement of the mitochondria also shows the mixing of ecto- and endoplasmic components. These
organelles are characteristic for the endoplasm of trophic Dileptus. In the cysts, the mitochondria were
found close to the cell membrane as well as inside the cytoplasm. Whether there are structural changes in
the mitochondria of the encysted individuals could be not clarified.
In young and old cysts there are bundles of microtubular fibers arranged randomly in the cytoplasm. They
probably correspond to the fibrillar bundles observed under the light microscope. The bundles seen in the
electron microscope are of different diameter and contain about 2000 microtubules each. The observations
suggest the possibility of splitting of large bundles into several small bundles. The microtubules in each
bundle show similar, parallel arrangement. The packets of microtubular material are situated directly in
the cytoplasm, and no autophagic vacuoles were observed around them. Any interconnection between the
microtubules was not seen; likewise, no contact between the bundles and the kinetosomes was observed.
The length of the bundles, the number of microtubules and their arrangement suggest that they represent
the remnants of the cytopharyngeal basket of the oral apparatus of the trophic cell. If so, then this supports
the conclusion that the kinetosomes of the oral ciliature are completely resorbed.
The material filling the macro- and micronuclei in encysted forms of D. visscheri is morphologically
different from the contents of the trophic nuclei. In the macronuclei of the cysts large agglomerations of
granular material of different osmophility occur. The chromatin of the micronuclei is more condensed in
comparison with the trophic form. The nuclei are covered by a double membrane.
In young cysts of D. visscheri very often vesicles filled with electron-dense material are seen. These vesicles
represent autophagic vacuoles. They contain mucocysts, toxicysts and other membranous structures. The
vacuoles are dispersed randomly through the cytoplasm. In older cysts, the autophagic vacuoles contain
material of low density.
In the light microscopic study, we observed contractile vacuoles in the cyst. In the ultrastructural studies of
young cysts vesicles were found. They show some resemblance to the contractile vacuoles of the trophic
cells. The vacuole in the cyst is surrounded by a single membrane, the cytoplasm surrounding the vacuole
is reach in flattened vesicles, which would correspond to the spongiplasm accompanying the contractile
vacuoles in trophonts. The site of the contact between the vacuole and the cell membrane (excretory pore)
was not found.
The cytoplasm of the encysted cells shows a considerable condensation of cellular structures. The density
of the cytoplasm is greater in older cysts than in younger ones. It contains numerous, membrane-free
56

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
ribosomes and irregular agglomerations of electron-dense material, probably lipids. In old cysts, there are
more such agglomerations than in young cysts, and they are closer to the surface. The cytoplasm does not
contain toxicysts, which are so characteristic for the endoplasm and oral region of trophonts. On sections
through young cysts, toxicysts are present, but only in the autophagic vacuoles.“
Excystment. The excystment process in Dileptus jonesi (misidentified as D. anser) was studied by Jones
(1951). The events after excystation in Apodileptus visscheri were examined by kink (1976).
Jones’ observations read as follows: “Cysts usually remained in the excysting medium for 4.5 hours before
the first signs of activation were observed. Contractile vacuole activity and a very slow cyclosis constituted
the first signs of excystment. Figures 12 and 17 (reproduced here as Fig. 28h) show a cyst in the early
stages of excystment. The thick, colorless ectocyst can be seen closely investing the pigmented mesocyst.
This, in turn, appears to be in contact with the animal, although an endocyst is present. However the
endocyst cannot be seen in the resting cyst or in the early stages of excystment. A large contractile vacuole
can be seen in both figures. Contractile vacuole activity continues; the animal swells, rupturing the outer
cyst membranes, and the swollen animal tightly invested by the thin endocyst can be seen through the
fissure. Figures 14 and 18 (reproduced here as Fig. 28i) show the ruptured cyst, with the animal protruding
slightly through the opening toward the observer. Two large contractile vacuoles are visible. Elevation of
the endocyst occurs at this time. Figures 13 and 19 (reproduced here as Fig. 28j) show slightly elevated
endocysts. The mesocyst is shown in optical section in these figures, and appears more heavily pigmented
than is actually the case. Contractile vacuole activity increases gradually and differentiation begins at this
stage. Cilia appear and the animal begins to spin slowly within the endocyst. The endocyst now increases
in diameter, and the animal increases its speed of rotation (Figs. 15 and 20; reproduced here as Fig.
28k). The animal in Fig. 15 appears as a blur due to the rapidity of its rotation. This photograph clearly
demonstrates the three cyst membranes. Figure 20 (reproduced here as Fig. 28k) shows in side view an
animal which has elongated sufficiently to double on itself. This figure, which shows the endocyst well,
was drawn 5 hours and 20 minutes after the cyst had been placed in the excystment medium. Five minutes
later, the animal had the appearance shown in Figs. 16 and 21 (reproduced here as Fig. 28l). The proboscis
has begun to differentiate and the endocyst has become greatly enlarged, spreading the 2 cyst halves
widely apart. Here again the three cyst membranes are clearly shown. At this stage of excystment, the
animal pushes against the endocyst, first with its proboscis, then with the pointed caudal end, in an effort
to be free of the endocyst. Finally the endocyst ruptures and the animal escapes. It requires from 5.5 to 6
hours for the completion of excystment.”
Jones (1951) then continues with the description of the excysted cells: “The newly excysted animal is
easily differentiated from the mature trophic animal. There are three conspicuous features by which the
newly excysted D. anser may be recognized. The shape of the proboscis is perhaps the most obvious in that
it is shortened and bears a blunted tip (Fig. 22; reproduced here as Fig. 28m). The cytoplasm of the entire
organism is tan and hyaline-like in appearance. These two characters strongly reflect the appearance of the
early precystic animal. A third, less obvious difference is the arrangement of the contractile vacuoles. At
this early stage they are arranged more or less irregularly along the body. Later, they become aligned along
the dorsal margin, extending from the base of the proboscis to the posterior end. Figure 22 (reproduced
here as Fig. 28m) shows an animal 5 minutes after its emergence from the cyst”.
kink (1976) studied processes after excystation using in vivo observation and TEM. She noted that cells
grow intensively after excystation to reach the trophic size. The growth includes both the somatic part of
the body as well as the oral parts that consist of the oral bulge opening and the proboscis. From the time of
excystation and during growth of the cell, the oral apparatus is able to capture and ingest prey. Growth of
an oral apparatus while functioning has not previously been reported in ciliates. The proliferation of new
57

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
oral kinetosomes in the growing oral apparatus occurs only around the oral bulge opening. An extensive
proliferation of somatic ciliature occurs in the anterior portion of the kineties abutting on the oral opening.
Thus, there is a growth zone around the oral opening, supplying new kinetosomes for the growing oral
opening, the elongating proboscis, and the growth of the rest of the body. The oral kinetosomes are formed
randomly in large numbers, appearing similar to an anarchic field, while the somatic kinetosomes arise
singly from dikinetid-like kinetids.
3 Ecology, Occurrence and Geographic Distribution
Little is known about these subjects for most species reviewed in this monograph. Modern investigations on
the ecology of dileptids are lacking, except for a few studies by, for instance, Butkay (2004) and sonntag
et al. (2007). Their results are mentioned in the species description of Pelagodileptus trachelioides.
Dileptus margaritifer has been used as a model organism in various ecological (e.g., holyoak & sachDeV
1998, Petchey 2000) and pharmacological (e.g., samoVar & orloVskaJa 1979, orloVskaJa 1982) studies.
According to PhilPott’s (1930) observations, the venome of Crotalus has no effect on Monomacrocaryon
gigas. Another kind of experiments was performed by metzner (1933), who cut off the proboscis of
Dileptus margaritifer either with the oral bulge opening or without. Interestingly, stomous and astomous
proboscides have the same feeding reactions as normal (= complete) Dileptus specimens. hull (1961)
showed that D. margaritifer is attacked by the suctorian Podophrya collini which survived for 20 days on
this Dileptus diet.
Generation time and respiration are known only for a few species. Specifically, Monomacrocaryon gigas
has 0.3 to 1.4 divisions within 24 h according to ruDin (1937). The generation time of Dileptus margaritifer
is about 17 h at an uptake rate of 10–13 Tetrahymena cells/h (khleBoVich 1976), while about 11 h at 20
°C according to PetroVa et al. (1976). As concerns Paradileptus sp., mueller (1989) gives a generation
time of about 210 h at 8.5 °C. klekowski (1981) calculated for Pseudomonilicaryon anser an oxygen
consumption of 3000 pl O /ind./h at 23 °C, while chorik & shuBernetsky (1978) mentioned 2400 pl O /
2 2
ind./h at 23 °C.
Several dileptids are used as indicators of water quality: Dileptus margaritifer, Monilicaryon monilatum,
Paradileptus elephantinus, Pelagodileptus trachelioides, and Trachelius ovum. A detailed description of
the morphology and ecology of these species was given in the “ciliate atlas” (Foissner et al. 1995, 1999).
Derkach et al. (1995) studied the effects of heavy metal cations on the adenylate cyclase activity and
culture growth of Dileptus margaritifer. They showed that various heavy metals inhibit the activity of the
adenylate cyclase in the following order: Hg2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+.
Dileptids occur throughout the year in a wide range of biotopes. Out of 66 recognized dileptid species
and subspecies, 26 taxa have been recorded in terrestrial or semi-terrestrial habitats, 21 taxa in freshwater
biotopes, and 12 taxa in both terrestrial and limnetic environments (Table 7). Terrestrial species live in
soil, mosses, bark of trees, and in leaf and needle litter. Most freshwater species are bottom-dwellers,
gliding in and on organic mud, stones, macrophytes, between algae, and in the air-water interface (for a
review, see Foissner et al. 1995). Some freshwater species, e.g., D. margaritifer, Monomacrocaryon gigas,
Pseudomonilicaryon anser and Trachelius ovum, can be occasionally found in the plankton of stagnant and
running waters, while Paradileptus elephantinus and Pelagodileptus trachelioides live exclusively in the
pelagial of lakes and ponds (Foissner et al. 1999). Only seven dileptids have been found in brackish water,
the sea and/or in saline soils: Apotrachelius multinucleatus, Dileptus estuarinus, Pseudomonilicaryon
marinum marinum, P. marinum minimum, P. massutti, Rimaleptus lacazei, and R. tirjakovae. No species
is symbiotic or parasitic on or in other organisms. However, Dileptus margaritifer may act as a vector for
various viruses (teras 1986, teras & kesa 1990).

a Only substantiated records.
b Some data might refer to the subspecies Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides paucivacuolata because it was rarely separated before.
The terrestrial dileptids share several distinct features that are probably adaptations to the soil environment
(Vďačný & Foissner 2008b): (i) Body shape is usually very slender or even vermiform, and average body
length is smaller by about 300 μm than in freshwater species (Foissner 1987a). Both peculiarities might be
related to the restricted space available in the soil pores, i.e., the narrowness of the habitat. (ii) Reduction of
the proboscis to one quarter or less of body length, for instance, in Pseudomonilicaryon brachyproboscis,
Rimaleptus armatus, and three Microdileptus species. This peculiarity is possibly related to the fragility of
60
2

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
the proboscis and the space available for prey digestion. The physical load is likely higher in soil than in
free water, e.g., by passive and active transport of soil particles with sharp edges and/or heavy weight. The
proboscis is for prey recognition and prey capture. In the small terrestrial dileptids it might be advantageous
to increase the space for digestion by shortening of the proboscis because prey cannot escape so easily
in the narrow soil pores. However, a short proboscis likely decreases prey recognition; possibly this is
compensated by the long dorsal bristles (see next item). Interestingly, a very short proboscis occurs also
in Monilicaryon monilatum, typically found in the benthic mud of limnetic habitats (Foissner 1997a). (iii)
The dorsal bristles are usually longer in soil than in limnetic dileptids (up to 15 μm vs. about 5 μm), e.g., in
Rimaleptus alpinus and R. longitrichus. If a sensory function of the brush bristles is assumed, long bristles
may be of advantage in recognizing the prey in a habitat where it is more difficult to notice signals, for
instance, prey movement in a water film. The long bristles might compensate for the disadvantage of the
short proboscis (see above). (iv) Pronounced flexibility of the body which fosters movement in a wrinkled
and narrow habitat, i.e., in soil pores. However, distinct body flexibility is not confined to terrestrial species
but occurs in all dileptids. This might explain the high diversity of dileptids in terrestrial habitats.
As in most ciliates, little is known on the geographic distribution of dileptids. Many have been discovered
or found in the Holarctis, while only very few species (e.g., Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides, Rimaleptus
alpinus and R. mucronatus) have been recorded from all biogeographic regions. However, the actual
distribution of most species is not known because few reliable records are available. This and some other
basic data are shown in Table 7.
4 Phylogeny and Evolution
Dileptids are part of the class Litostomatea, a highly diverse taxon comprising hundreds of species ranging
from aerobic, free-living predators to anaerobic endocommensals. This was traditionally reflected by
classifying the Litostomatea into the subclasses Haptoria and Trichostomatia. Dileptids were assigned
to the Haptoria because their overall morphology and way of life are similar to many other members
of this subclass, especially, to spathidiids (corliss 1979, Foissner & Foissner 1988a, lynn 2008).
Moreover, dileptids were considered as crown haptorians, possibly originating from a spathidiid ancestor
by development of a proboscis with a complex ciliature (Xu & Foissner 2005). This assumption was also
corroborated by the formation of various spathidiid body shapes and ciliary patterns during ontogenesis
and conjugation of dileptids (Vďačný & Foissner 2008a, 2009). However, the phylogenetic position of the
dileptids within the Haptoria became controversial when their first 18S rRNA gene sequence was published
because it classified them basal to all other haptorians (strüDer-kyPke et al. 2006, gao et al. 2008,
Vďačný et al. 2010). Our recent analyses based on eight new dileptid 18S rRNA gene sequences showed
that dileptids cluster outside the haptorian clade, forming a monophylum, the subclass Rhynchostomatia,
which is sister to the subclass Haptoria including the Trichostomatia (Vďačný et al. 2011a, b).
In chapter 4.1, the ground pattern of the Litostomatea is described. This is important for understanding the
deep litostomatean evolution and reconstruction of the dileptid morphological evolution, which is treated
in chapter 4.2. In the last two chapters, the molecular phylogeny of the dileptids is compared with the
morphological results.
4.1 Ground Pattern and Deep Evolution of the Litostomatea
The ground pattern of a monophyletic taxon is a combination of apomorphies and younger plesiomorphies
present in the stem species (last common ancestor) from which the monophylum evolved (aX 1995). Based
on morphology and ontogeny of litostomateans and armophoreans (i.e., the sister group of the Litostomatea),
61

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
Vďačný et al. (2010) hypothesized that the last common ancestor of the Litostomatea possessed the
following more recent plesiomorphies: (i) an oblong body with ventrally located oral apparatus; (ii) plate-
like arranged postciliary microtubules to the right of and between the ciliary rows; and (iii) a telokinetal
stomatogenesis commencing in the dorsal or dorsolateral kineties and with migrating oral kinetofragments.
Further, Vďačný et al. (2010, 2011a) argued that the last common ancestor of the Litostomatea evolved
the following apomorphies: (i) monokinetidal somatic kineties anteriorly differentiated into a three-rowed
dikinetidal dorsal brush; (ii) a complex oral ciliary pattern comprising a dikinetidal circumoral kinety and
several preoral kineties; (iii) toxicysts fostering a predatory way of life; (iv) a cytopharynx of the rhabdos
type; and (v) a heteropolar conjugation mode (Fig. 30). Thus, the ground oral ciliary pattern of the ancient
Litostomatea was morphologically more complex than that of extant haptorians and trichostomatians,
which lost the preoral kineties and sometimes also the circumoral kinety, e.g., the free-living Enchelyidae
and the endocommensal Trichostomatia. According to our analyses, dileptids are morphologically nearest
to the last common progenitor of the Litostomatea, as they are the only litostomateans that maintained the
ancestral oral apparatus (ventrally located oral opening, presence of many preoral kineties).
Molecular phylogenies consistently show a deep bifurcation of the Litostomatea (Vďačný et al. 2011a, b).
The first lineage is named Rhynchostomatia and comprises tracheliids and dileptids s.str., both characterized
by a ventrally located oral opening at the base of a proboscis that carries a complex oral ciliature. The second
lineage includes the free-living haptorians and the endocommensal trichostomatians, both characterized
by body polarization and simplification of the oral ciliature. The polar position of the oral opening is
not correlated with the length and shape of the oral bulge, thus representing a strong apomorphy of the
Haptoria and Trichostomatia (Fig. 30). However, according to the molecular phylogenies, the position of
the oral opening was modified in some of the more derived trichostomatians. Specifically, the opening
sunk into an anterior oral cavity in Balantidium, and was displaced posteriorly in the isotrichids (e.g.,
Dasytricha and Isotricha).
4.2 Morphological Evolution of Dileptids
Morphological evolution of dileptids has been recently studied in detail by Vďačný et al. (2011b). The
results of their study are reported here in full length.
4.2.1 Characters and Character States
The cladistic analyses are based on five groups of diagnostic and phylogenetically informative characters
in dileptids: the morphology of the oral apparatus (characters 1–7), pattern and division mode of the
nuclear apparatus (characters 8–10), contractile vacuole pattern (character 11), patterns of the somatic
ciliature (characters 12–14), and habitat (character 15). The genus Spathidium is chosen as the outgroup
because it is morphologically nearest to dileptids and belongs to the subclass Haptoria, which is a sister
group of the Rhynchostomatia (Vďačný et al. 2010, 2011a, b). The characters and character states are
summarized in Table 8, and their distribution is given in Table 9.
Character 1: Structure of circumoral kinety. The outgroup has a circumoral kinety composed exclusively
of dikinetids. This state is maintained in only a single dileptid genus, Trachelius. All other dileptids display
a unique, highly derived state, i.e., a hybrid circumoral kinety composed of dikinetids in the proboscis and
oral monokinetids associated with nematodesmata around the oral bulge opening (e.g., golińska 1991,
1995). Interestingly, nematodesmata-bearing monokinetids (so-called “oralized somatic monokinetids”)
also occur in the acropisthiids and enchelyine haptorians (Foissner & Foissner 1985, 1988a), where they
are not part of a circumoral kinety, but are localized in the anterior portion of the somatic ciliary rows and
bear nematodesmata forming the external oral basket.

Fig. 30: An evolutionary scenario for the morphological evolution of two main litostomatean lineages (from Vďačný et al.
2011a). Only apomorphies are shown. The first lineage is named Rhynchostomatia and comprises tracheliids and dileptids s.str.,
both characterized by a ventrally located oral opening at the base of a proboscis that carries a complex oral ciliature. The second
lineage includes the free-living Haptoria and the endocommensal Trichostomatia, both characterized by body polarization and
simplification of the oral ciliature. As explained in this figure, the polar position of the oral opening is not correlated with the
length and shape of the oral bulge, thus representing a strong apomorphy of the haptorians and trichostomatians. However, the
position of the oral opening was modified in some trichostomatians, viz., in the balantidiids and isotrichids. B – dorsal brush, CK
– circumoral kinety, CV – contractile vacuoles, OB – oral bulge, OO – oral opening, PE – perioral kinety, PR – preoral kineties,
SK – somatic kineties.

Character 2: Preoral kineties. The left branch of the circumoral kinety is associated with many short,
oblique preoral kineties in all dileptid genera, Monilicaryon being an exception, displaying instead a single
perioral-like kinety (Foissner 1997). However, this kinety very likely originates from a linear arrangement
of many short preoral kineties. We base this assumption on the pattern of several “typical” dileptids in
which the preoral kineties are so strongly oblique that they almost form a single, perioral-like kinety.
Character 3: Perioral kinety. In almost all dileptid genera, the right branch of the circumoral kinety is
accompanied by a single, densely ciliated perioral kinety. Two perioral kineties side by side, in addition
to the circumoral kinety, represent a derived state occurring only in a specialized group of planktonic
dileptids, viz., Paradileptus and Pelagodileptus (Foissner et al. 1999), where many densely spaced cilia
might increase the efficiency of food acquisition.
Character 4: Localization of oral bulge opening. The oral bulge opening is on the ventral surface at the
base of the proboscis in most dileptids. Only in Paradileptus is the opening on the left side and rotated by
approximately 180° (wenrich 1929). Obviously, this is a derived state.
Character 5: Shape of oral bulge opening. Three variants can be distinguished. Roundish openings occur
in many haptorians and most dileptids, suggestive of a plesiomorphic state. In the genus Paradileptus, the
roundish oral bulge opening became inverted, i.e., the posterior end of the opening faces the anterior end
of the cell (see above). When the roundish opening is stretched, a more or less elliptical pattern is formed
as found in the genera Pelagodileptus and Dimacrocaryon, but also in Pseudomonilicaryon angustistoma
(Foissner 1984; Foissner et al. 1999, 2002). The occurrence of elliptical to very narrowly elliptical oral
openings in several, possibly fairly distantly related genera indicates that this feature evolved convergently
several times.
Character 6: Oral basket. Nine out of the ten dileptid genera have a distinct oral basket composed of long
rods (nematodesmata) like in many other haptorians. However, in Dimacrocaryon, the basket rods are so
fine that they are recognizable only with TEM. Additionally, the oral basket is lined with highly refractive
granules, thus appearing in vivo as a conspicuous oral sac. This state is considered an apomorphy.
Character 7: Shape of internal oral basket. The oral apparatus is composed, inter alia, of an internal
and external basket. The nematodesmata of the external basket originate from the basal bodies around
the oral bulge opening and form a conical structure. The internal basket is formed by laminar transverse
microtubule arrays embedded in fibrillar material (grain & golińska 1969). Three shape variants of the
internal oral basket evolved: obconical, club-like, and bulbous. The obconical internal basket is common
in haptorians and most dileptids, indicating it as the ancestral state. Trachelius has a strongly developed,
long, club-shaped internal basket, while that of most Rimaleptus species is short and bulbous.
Characters 8 and 9: Nuclear pattern. Jankowski (1967) first recognized the number and arrangement of
the macronuclear nodules as a very stable feature of high cladistic significance in dileptids. The molecular
data from several heterotrichs, such as Blepharisma and Stentor, suggest the monomacronucleate state
as ancestral (schmiDt et al. 2007, thamm et al. 2010). This is sustained during the ontogenesis where a
monomacronucleate pattern occurs transiently even in species with two or several macronuclear nodules
(PenarD 1922, golińska 1965, Vďačný & Foissner 2009). When Haeckel’s ontogenetic principle is
applied, the Monomacrocaryon pattern should be considered to be the plesiomorphic state. Further, the
Monomacrocaryon pattern is quite common in haptorids in general and in the outgroup in particular.
Four macronuclear patterns can be distinguished, each considered to define a distinct genus. The number
and pattern of the micronuclei is correlated with the macronucleus, and thus will not be used in the
cladistic analysis.
Monomacrocaryon pattern (Fig. 12b): The macronucleus is a more or less long rod, sometimes slightly to
64

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
markedly constricted in the middle. This pattern occurs only in Trachelius and Monomacrocaryon.
Dimacrocaryon pattern (Fig. 12c): Two oblong nodules with a single micronucleus in between occur in two
dileptid genera, viz., Dimacrocaryon and Rimaleptus. Rarely, Monomacrocaryon has a rather pronounced
constriction in the mid-portion of the macronucleus with a single micronucleus close to it, showing how
the binucleate state may have evolved.
Monilicaryon pattern (Fig. 12e): At least four serially arranged nodules form a moniliform or distinctly
nodulated strand. This pattern has been found in four possibly closely related genera, viz., Monilicaryon,
Pseudomonilicaryon, Pelagodileptus, and Paradileptus. A moniliform macronucleus very likely evolved
from the Dimacrocaryon pattern by doubling the nodule number. Thus, in the first step a chain of four
nodules was generated, still present in some species (e.g., Pseudomonilicaryon edaphoni, P. aculeatum)
and highly characteristic for early exconjugants (Visscher 1927, VinnikoVa 1974a, Vďačný & Foissner
2008a). Later, further divisions added more nodules.
Dileptus pattern (Fig. 12d): Usually more than 50 small, oblong nodules scattered in the trunk. This pattern
is typical for two genera, viz., Dileptus and Apodileptus. The Dileptus pattern very likely evolved from
the Monilicaryon pattern by fragmentation of the moniliform macronuclear strand. This hypothesis is
supported by the conjugation data. In ex-conjugants of Dileptus margaritifer, four macronuclear anlagen
transiently form a Monilicaryon pattern. Later, the anlagen divide amitotically generating hundreds of
scattered nodules (Visscher 1927).
Character 10: Division mode of macronucleus (Fig. 22). Three division modes occur, the first mode
being most widespread in ciliates and thus considered as plesiomorphic (raikoV 1996).
Monomacrocaryon mode: In mid-dividers, the macronucleus condenses to a globular mass that becomes a
long rod that divides into two oblong pieces (Vďačný & Foissner 2009). Two modifications of this mode
evolved: (i) in the binucleate dileptids, the condensed mass divides twice generating two nodules each in
the proter and opisthe, while (ii) in dileptids with moniliform macronucleus, the mass divides once into
two oblong pieces which elongate and become nodulated (golińska 1965).
Apodileptus mode: In mid-dividers, the scattered macronuclear nodules fuse to a globular mass that
divides into two pieces. In post-dividers, each piece becomes a short strand and later a three-dimensional
reticulum that fragments into many nodules, as in multinucleate spathidiids and fuscheriids (Foissner et
al. 2002, gaBilonDo & Foissner 2009).
Dileptus mode: In the multinucleate genus Dileptus, each nodule divides individually (hayes 1938, Jones
1951, golińska 1971). This is a rare mode occasionally found also in multinucleate hypotrichs, specifically,
in the genus Pseudokeronopsis, where this character is considered apomorphic and defines the subfamily
Pseudokeronopsinae (Berger 2006).
Character 11: Contractile vacuole pattern. Most haptorids and spathidiids possess a single, terminal
contractile vacuole, while all described dileptids have at least two, one each in the anterior and posterior
half of the trunk. However, there is a second dorsal vacuole in some spathidiids, e.g., Arcuospathidium
bulli (Foissner 2000) and Spathidium faurefremieti (Foissner 2003), suggesting a bi- or multivacuolate
ancestor of dileptids. We suppose that the first derived state is a dorsal row (stripe) of vacuoles and the
second derived state is a stripe of vacuoles each in the dorsal and ventral side of the cell. The cladogram
shows that various contractile vacuole patterns evolved convergently in dileptids, and thus the feature is
of significance mainly at species level.
Character 12: Right side fossa. This concavity, surrounded and lined by narrowly spaced kineties, is
present only in Trachelius (ehrenBerg 1838, Foissner 1997).
Character 13: Dorsal brush pattern. In the outgroup and in Trachelius, the brush rows start at the
65

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
same level anteriorly, while all other dileptids have a stagered brush with the rows gradually shortened
anteriorly from left to right. The stagered pattern is not caused by simple spatial constraints since there is
sufficient space available for full-length brush rows in both the large species and in the small ones with a
two-rowed brush. Thus, the stagered brush is considered as an apomorphy.
Character 14: Number of dorsal brush rows. In many haptorids and most spathidiids, the dorsal brush
is composed of three rows, a pattern found in only one dileptid genus, viz., Trachelius (song & wilBert
1989, Foissner 1997). All other dileptids have one, two or many rows. In the two-rowed species, such as
Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides, a third row may be present in some specimens (Foissner 1984), possibly
a vestige of the ancestral state. In accordance with Foissner et al. (2002), we consider a lower or higher
number than three brush rows as apomorphic.
Character 15: Habitat. Several dileptid genera show a distinct habitat preference. For instance, Trachelius
occurs mainly in the periphyton, where it feeds predominantly on peritrichs, while Pelagodileptus and
Paradileptus are restricted to the pelagial (Foissner et al. 1999); Monilicaryon inhabits benthic mud
(Foissner 1997, Foissner et al. 1995), while Dimacrocaryon and Rimaleptus prefer terrestrial biotopes
(Foissner 1998). Periphyton-inhabiting protists have a number of features (e.g., pronounced flexibility
of the body) pre-adapting them for the exploitation of soil (schönBorn 1966). schönBorn’s model also
shows that a variety of freshwater niches may be colonized from the periphyton, which is thus supposed to
be the ancestral habitat, from which dileptids spread into the benthic, pelagic and soil environments.
Characters and genera not considered: The following features were not included in the cladistic approach
because they are known only in a small portion of the species or are merely relevant to intrageneric
evolution: the presence/absence of a tail, the somatic ciliary pattern of the right and left side of the
proboscis, ontogenetic peculiarities (e.g., presence/absence of a transient indentation in the prospective
fission area), the fate of the parental degenerating macronucleus during conjugation (e.g., nodules fusing
into a mass that degenerates or the nodules degenerating individually), the fate of the macronucleus
during encystment (e.g., fusing or not fusing), and resting cyst characteristics (e.g., cyst wall structure and
presence/absence of escape apparatus).
Two genera, Teuthophrys and Branchioecetes, traditionally assigned to the dileptids, were excluded.
Teuthophrys belongs to the spathidiids (Foissner et al. 1999, strüDer-kyPke et al. 2006), and Branchioecetes
is still very poorly known (kahl 1931) and invalid because no type species was fixed (Article 13.3 of the
ICZN 1999).
4.2.2 Hennigian Argumentation and Morphological Trees
Vďačný et al. (2011b) elucidated the morphological evolution of dileptids using both Hennig’s traditional
(i.e., manual) method (Fig. 31) and computer-assisted statistical methods, including Bayesian inference
(BI) and maximum parsimony (MP) algorithm (Fig. 32). As expected, the cladograms generated by each
approach are similar because they are based on the same characters. The Hennigian argumentation tree
provides better resolution among the multinucleate family Dileptidae. The family Dimacrocaryonidae
is paraphyletic in cladograms generated by both approaches since we have been unable to identify a
morphological synapomorphy for Monomacrocaryon and the Dimacrocaryon-Rimaleptus lineage.
Dileptids share the following synapomorphies: (i) a proboscis with a complex oral ciliature and (ii) at
least two dorsal contractile vacuoles. Based on the Hennigian argumentation, we propose that their last
common ancestor inherited the following plesiomorphies from the last common progenitor of the class
Litostomatea: (i) a dikinetidal circumoral kinety; (ii) an oblong, unsegmented macronucleus; and (iii) a
three-rowed, not staggered dorsal brush. The proboscis of the ancestor was most likely immobile and

short, i.e., resembling that of Trachelius. This is also consistent with the maturation processes of the
proboscis (Vďačný & Foissner 2009).
The cladogram is based on 15 characters dividing dileptids into two major lineages: (i) the monotypic
order Tracheliida containing the family Tracheliidae and (ii) the order Dileptida uniting the families
Dimacrocaryonidae and Dileptidae. This deep split into two orders is moderately to poorly supported with
a posterior probability (PP) of 0.62 and MP bootstrap values of 75% (Fig. 32).
Order Tracheliida. This order is defined by three apomorphies: (i) a club-shaped internal oral basket; (ii)
a lateral fossa with specialized ciliature; and (iii) many scattered contractile vacuoles. The latter feature
evolved at least two times convergently, viz., in the Pelagodileptus-Paradileptus clade and in some species
of the genus Dileptus. Tracheliids display several old plesiomorphies inherited from the last common
ancestor of the class Litostomatea: (i) a dikinetidal circumoral kinety; (ii) a three-rowed, not staggered
dorsal brush; and (iii) a short, immobile proboscis. Thus, this order differs from the order Dileptida by
several important morphological traits, i.e., by the unique fossa, the structure of the circumoral kinety
(dikinetidal vs. hybrid), and the dorsal brush pattern (not staggered vs. staggered).
Order Dileptida. This order unites nine genera, sharing the following strong synapomorphies: (i) a
hybrid circumoral kinety; (ii) a staggered dorsal brush and, possibly in connection, (iii) a stripe without
cilia on the left side of the proboscis. In both the Hennigian argumentation scheme and the morphological
trees generated from statistical methods, there are three lineages within this order (Figs 31, 32): (i)
Monomacrocaryon with an unsegmented macronucleus; (ii) Dimacrocaryon and Rimaleptus with two
macronuclear nodules; and (iii) a large clade comprising six genera having many macronuclear nodules.
The first two lineages are united into the family Dimacrocaryonidae, while the third clade represents the
68

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
family Dileptidae. A sister relationship of the Dimacrocaryon-Rimaleptus clade and the family Dileptidae
is indicated by the segmented macronucleus consisting of at least two nodules. Further, this relationship
is supported by a posterior probability of 0.86 and 66% MP bootstraps. However, in the absence of a
recognized morphological synapomorphy for the genus Monomacrocaryon and the Dimacrocaryon-
Rimaleptus clade, we cannot exclude the possibility that the relationship between the Dimacrocaryon-
Rimaleptus clade and the family Dileptidae is an artefact.
Family Dimacrocaryonidae. This family is paraphyletic in both the Hennigian argumentation scheme
and the computer-generated cladograms (see above). The classification of Monomacrocaryon within the
family Dimacrocaryonidae is based on the similarity of the nuclear pattern. The two macronuclear nodules
of Dimacrocaryon and most Rimaleptus species are usually so close together that they appear as a single,
oblong structure resembling the macronucleus of Monomacrocaryon. Further, only these three genera
have a single micronucleus which is, however, very likely a plesiomorphic feature.
The genera Dimacrocaryon and Rimaleptus likely descend from a common ancestor inhabiting terrestrial
habitats (Figs 31, 32). This is also the most parsimonious explanation for the pronounced similarities in
the nuclear apparatus (two macronuclear nodules with a single micronucleus in between) and the oral as
well as the somatic ciliature (dileptid oral ciliary pattern and a two-rowed dorsal brush). However, the oral
apparatus of the genus Dimacrocaryon deviates not only from that of Rimaleptus but also from that of all
other dileptids, in having (i) an oral basket lined with highly refractive granules; (ii) a hardly protruding oral
bulge; and (iii) a narrowly elliptical oral bulge opening. The latter feature probably evolved convergently
as explained in the description of the characters. The cladograms suggest that the peculiarities of the oral
apparatus of Dimacrocaryon arose relatively recently. The single apomorphy of Rimaleptus is the short,
bulbous internal oral basket.
Family Dileptidae. The monophyly of the family Dileptidae is supported by two apomorphies: (i) more than
three dorsal brush rows and (ii) four or more macronuclear nodules. Further, it is moderately supported by
Bayesian interference (0.93 PP) and by 71% MP bootstraps (Fig. 32). However, the internal relationships
of the family Dileptidae are rather poorly resolved in the computer-generated trees. Therefore, we refer
here mainly to the cladogram created by traditional Hennigian argumentation, where we recognized two
separate branches: the Monilicaryon and the Dileptus branch (Fig. 31).
The Monilicaryon branch unites four genera, exhibiting a moniliform macronuclear strand of at least four
nodules. They form two clades which differ mainly in the oral ciliary pattern: Pseudomonilicaryon and
Monilicaryon maintained the plesiomorphic state, while Paradileptus and Pelagodileptus each evolved
an additional perioral kinety. The monilicaryonid and paradileptid pattern can be derived from that of
Pseudomonilicaryon (Fig. 33). The single apomorphy of the first clade is the dorsal stripe of contractile
vacuoles that very likely evolved convergently, for instance, in the Dimacrocaryonidae. The important
cladistic characteristics of the mud-inhabiting Monilicaryon are: (i) a perioral-like kinety left of the oral
bulge formed by linearly arranged preoral kineties and (ii) a dorsal brush composed of several kineties which
appear as a single, fragmented row. In the computer-generated trees, Monilicaryon is sister to the Dileptus
branch. However, this node is only very poorly supported (0.50 PP). The genus Pseudomonilicaryon lacks
a distinct apomorphy, with the possible exception of a preference for soil environment. The Paradileptus-
Pelagodileptus clade is strongly supported by three apomorphies: (i) right branch of the circumoral kinety
accompanied by two perioral kineties side by side, (ii) many scattered contractile vacuoles, and (iii) a
planktonic way of life. Further, this clade is strongly supported by all statistical analyses (0.95 PP, 90%
MP). Pelagodileptus evolved a very narrowly elliptical oral bulge opening, while Paradileptus broadened
the left half of the proboscis base to a dish-like platform taking along the oral bulge and the bulge opening
which became inverted and laterally located (Fig. 33).

Vďačný et al. 2011b). Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony were used to construct the tree, both resulting in the same
topology. Nodal supports are indicated by posterior probabilities for the Bayesian inference (BI) and bootstrap values for the
maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis shown above and by Bremer indexes shown below each node. For character coding and
distribution of characters among taxa, see Tables 8 and 9. The scale bar indicates the fraction of substitutions per site.
The apomorphy of the Dileptus branch is the nuclear pattern, i.e., many macronuclear nodules and several
micronuclei scattered throughout the cytoplasm. The monophyly of this clade is strongly to moderately
supported by Bayesian inference (0.93 PP) and by 75% MP bootstraps (Fig. 32). This clade comprises
two genera: Dileptus and Apodileptus, which are distinguishable only during binary fission. In Dileptus
each macronuclear nodule divides individually, while the multinucleate condition of Apodileptus results
from the fragmentation of an extensive reticulum into multiple nodules after division (Fig. 22). The latter
mode evolved convergently in several distantly related haptorians, for instance, in Spathidium turgitorum
(Foissner et al. 2002) and Fuscheria uluruensis (gaBilonDo & Foissner 2009).
4.3 Molecular Evolution of Dileptids
The 18S rRNA gene of the dileptids is only about 1640 nucleotides long, significantly shorter than that
of other ciliates, because of deletions in the helices 23–1, 23–8, 23–9, and the deletion of the entire helix
23–5 (Vďačný et al. 2011b). This is also typical for all other litostomatean sequences (leiPe et al. 1994;
wright & lynn 1997a, 1997b; wright et al. 1997; strüDer-kyPke et al. 2006; Vďačný et al. 2011a). The
level of intraspecies sequence variation is relatively low with an average of 0.23%. The most dissimilar
is Trachelius ovum, showing an average pairwise difference of 4.5% to all other dileptids. The average
pairwise difference among representatives from the order Dileptida is 2.1%.
Dileptids s.str. and tracheliids consistently form a clade, the subclass Rhynchostomatia, which is sister
to the subclass Haptoria including the Trichostomatia. This deep split within the Litostomatea is fully
sustained by four different methods (Fig. 34). In all analyses, T. ovum is sister to dileptids s.str. This
node is fully supported by Bayesian inference and strongly supported by 98% ML, 97% MP and 99%
NJ bootstrap values (Fig. 34), justifying, together with three strong morphological apomorphies, the

establishment of the order, Tracheliida. Such high ranking is also suggested by various morphological
peculiarities described in the morphological section. All other dileptids form a monophylum, the order
Dileptida (Figs 6, 7). The analyses consistently depict two clusters within this order, viz., the family
Dimacrocaryonidae (1.00 PP, 97% ML, 79% MP, and 90% NJ) with one or two macronuclear nodules
and a single micronucleus, and the family Dileptidae (0.87 PP, 70% ML, 52% MP, and 86% NJ) with at
least four macronuclear nodules and many micronuclei (Fig. 35). The internal relationships of the family
Dileptidae are very poorly resolved in all analyses, as there is a basal polytomy that is suggestive of a
radiation event (Figs 34, 35).
4.4 Comparison of Morphological and Molecular Phylogenies
The morphological trees are basically congruent with those based on the 18S rRNA gene sequences,
especially in that the genus Trachelius is sister to the dileptids s.str., and the order Dileptida as well as the
multinucleate family Dileptidae are monophyletic. The family Dimacrocaryonidae is monophyletic in the
molecular trees, while paraphyletic in the morphological analyses. This discrepancy is caused by the lack
of morphological synapomorphies for the genus Monomacrocaryon and the Dimacrocaryon-Rimaleptus
clade. Accordingly, the basal position of Monomacrocaryon within the order Dileptida in the morphological
trees is very likely artificial. The molecular data indicate that the unsegmented macronucleus of M. terrenum
evolved from a binucleate state by fusion of the macronuclear nodules and not vice versa as suggested by
morphological phylogenies. Further, dimacrocaryonid dileptids consistently cluster outside the Dileptus/
Pseudomonilicaryon/Pelagodileptus clade in morphological cladograms and molecular trees.

5 Classification
The major classification schemes for the dileptids are shown in Tables 10–18. We did not change the
original presentations, e.g., incorrect datings and spellings of names etc.
In the past, dileptids were classified as a subgroup of the order Gymnostomatida due to the holotrichous
ciliature (Bütschli 1889, kahl 1931, cheissin & Polianski 1963; Table 10). corliss (1974, 1979) placed
the dileptids in his order Haptorida, which he established for rapacious ciliates having a dorsal brush and
toxicysts (Table 12). Based on the conspicuous proboscis, Jankowski (1975) classified dileptids in a distinct
order, Rhynchostomatida (Table 11), which he later raised to subclass rank (Jankowski 1980). However,
this was not accepted by small & lynn (1981, 1985), who followed corliss (1979). Further, they added
important characters on the fine structure of the somatic and oral kinetids, creating the class Litostomatea.
Within the Litostomatea, they recognized the subclasses Haptoria and Trichostomatia, classifying the
dileptids in the order Haptorida (Table 16). Using morphological and ultrastructural data, Foissner &
Foissner (1988a) detailed the haptorian system and classified dileptids in the suborder Dileptina due to
the comparatively complex oral ciliary pattern (Table 14). This classification was accepted by liPscomB
& riorDan (1990, 1992), using 46 ultrastructural and light microscopical characters in their cladistic
analysis (Table 13). Puytorac (1994) and Jankowski (2007), also using light and electronmicroscopic
data, recognized the suborder Dileptina, but placed it into the order Spathidiida (Tables 15 and 16). The
recent molecular data basically support the Rhynchostomatia concept, in which dileptids are sister to all
other litostomateans, i.e., the haptorians and trichostomatians (Table 17).
6 Synonymy rate
The synonymy rate is important for calculating the number of valid taxa, locally and globally (for review,
see Foissner et al. 2008a). The synonymy rate (SR) was calculated as proportion of synonyms (S) to all
reliable dipletids (RD) including their synonyms (S): SR = S/(RD + S). We took into consideration only
those objective and subjective nomenclatural synonyms, where the data were sufficient to be sure that it is
a dileptid; subspecies were treated as species (Tables 19 and 20).
In the dileptids, the generic synonymy rate is 20%, which matches the rate for the total ciliate genera
(aescht 2001). However, if taxa with “unclear identity”are included, the rate increases to 45.5% (Table
19). In ciliate species, the synonymy rate is around 20% (Foissner et al. 2008a). This matches the 27.5%
found in dileptids. However, when the taxa with “unclear identity” are added, the rate inceases to 60.5%
(Table 20), mainly due to the poorly described taxa of Fromentel (1874–1876) and Dumas (1929, 1930,
1937).

Table 19: List of genera associated with dileptid ciliates. We recognize 12 dileptid genera and two to three synonyms
(Harmodirus, Ophryocerca, Phragelliorhynchus). All others are not dileptids but may belong to reliable genera, e.g.,
Amphileptus, or their identity is unclear.

a journal, which he could not remember, where it was used for Amphileptus trachelioides zacharias. Very likely, the genus Paradileptus was
meant.

9 Collecting, Culturing, Observing and Staining of Dileptid Ciliates
9.1 Collecting
The methods for collecting and culturing dileptid ciliates are treated only briefly as detailed descriptions
are provided either in the introductions to the families or in the species descriptions. Furthermore, the
general procedures as described, e.g., by the Committee on Cultures (1958) and lee & solDo (1992) apply
also to the dileptids. The beginner may also consult the valuable booklet by Finlay et al. (1988).
9.1.1 Limnetic and Marine Samples
Most described dileptids are from limnetic or limnetic-terrestrial habitats, such as ditches and puddles
with fallen leaves. Some have been discovered in “standing samples” with rotting materials, such as algal
masses and water plants. Few species each have been reported from activated sludge (maDoni 1981), the
lake plankton (Foissner et al. 1999), streams and rivers (DuDich 1967, DetcheVa 1983b, Foissner 1997a),
and marine sites (kahl 1930, 1933). In all these habitats, dileptids and other ciliates are sampled with
conventional methods, that is, plankton nets (mesh-wide ≤ 20 µm), by scraping the Aufwuchs, investigating
mud and algal masses, and mats of cyanobacteria.
Our own experiences with limnetic and marine samples are frustrating. Although we saw several species,
most were rare and did not grow in cultures. They never became as abundant as in soil samples. An almost
unexplored habitat are bog ponds and puddles, where we found at least two new species.
9.1.2 Moss and Soil Samples
Since kahl (1930) and wenzel (1953), terrestrial mosses are known to be a rich source for dileptids. Later,
this knowledge was extended to soil (Foissner 1984, 1998; Foissner et al. 2002, 2005). This is confirmed
by the present monograph, where over 15 new species are described from soil collected worldwide. Recent
experience suggests floodplain soils as a centre of dileptid diversity, possibly “collecting” some or most
of the limnetic species. The best way for growing these species is the non-flooded Petri dish method
described by Foissner (1987a). In 2002, Foissner, agatha & Berger updated the description, which is
here quoted in full.
9.1.2.1 Sampling and Sample Processing
The material collected included mineral top soil (0–5 cm, rarely up to 10 cm depth) with fine plant roots, the humic
layer, and the deciduous and/or grass litter from the soil surface. In soil with few organic materials and in sandy
habitats, litter was sieved off the sand with an ordinary kitchen sieve, so that the final sample consisted of about 80%
litter and 20% sand and gravel. Usually, 10 small subsamples were collected with a shovel from an area of about
86

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
100 m2 and mixed to a composite sample. Bark samples were usually taken from one to three trees. The bark was
collected with a knife, selecting for regions grown with mosses or lichens and/or containing some soil.
Generally, a “good” sample consists of 50% litter, humus and roots and 50% mineral soil. The litter and humus are
very important because they release many nutrients when the sample is rewetted, stimulating growth of bacteria, fungi,
flagellates, and amoebae, that is, the main food of ciliates. The nutrient increase obviously decouples microbiostasis,
as explained in Foissner (1987a, 1997c).
All samples were air-dried for at least one month and then sealed in plastic bags. Such samples can be stored for years
without any significant loss of species, provided they are from arid or temperate environments (Foissner 1997b,
Foissner et al. 2002).
9.1.2.2 The Non-flooded Petri Dish Method
a) Put the material in a Petri dish and loosely spread it over its bottom in at least a 1 cm, better 2 to 3 cm thick layer.
As concerns the present samples, usually sufficient material was available to fill a 2 cm high Petri dish 13 cm
across or, rarely, a 3 cm high dish 18 cm in diameter. Basically, a large Petri dish (18 cm) is preferable because it
provides more material for preparations.
b) Slightly over-saturate but do not flood the sample with distilled water. Water should be added to the sample
until 5–20 ml will drain off when the Petri dish is tilted (45°) and the soil gently pressed with a finger. Complete
saturation takes up to 12 hours, so check cultures after this time. Never flood the sample, that is, make an Aufguss
(“infusion”) because then only a few common species will develop. Further, the material should have been dry
for at least one month.
c) Cover Petri dish and pinch a clip between bottom and lid for air exchange. Generally, care must be taken that
samples do not putrefy. This happens easily with saline material, soil containing animal excrements, and samples
with very easily decomposable litter. If so, change the water in the sample and do not cover it for some days
so that plenty of air is available; further, slightly under-saturate sample with water. Heavily saline soil (≥ 20‰)
should be “washed”, if no ciliates develop: over-saturate the sample with water, as described above. After three
days, remove the percolate and saturate again with water. Repeat this two to four times, until ciliates develop.
d) A distinct succession occurs in the rewetted samples. Thus, they must be inspected on days 2, 6/7, 13/14, 21/22,
and 30. Later inspections usually add only few species, likely because microbiostasis (ciliatostasis; see Foissner
1987a) increases and metazoan (rotifers, nematods) and protozoan (mainly heliozoans!) predators often become
abundant. For inspection, the Petri dish is tilted some seconds and a rather large drop (~ 0.3 ml) of the drained
water (“soil percolate”) taken with a pipette and inspected for species; several such drops must be investigated
from different sites of the Petri dish, until the last drop adds but few species.
9.1.2.3 Collecting Material for Preparations
If a “difficult” species is noted, which happens in more than 70% of the samples, material for preparations must be
collected. To obtain many specimens, the Petri dish is gently tilted (45°–60°) several times for a minute or so and the
percolating water collected with a Pasteur pipette from several sites of the dish. If only little water (< 10 ml) drains
off and/or the species of interest is very rare, the sample should be sprinkled with 10–15 ml distilled water. This will
cause an osmotic shock, detaching or rinsing many specimens from the soil particles and capillaries within about 10
min. Then, the procedure described above is repeated, that is, the Petri dish is tilted several times and the percolating
soil water added to the first collection. Finally, the soil sample is again saturated with clean table or tap water and
stored for the next investigation. Certainly, these procedures strongly change the milieu, and thus a rather different
ciliate community may develop after a week or two, possibly containing further “difficult” species. If so, the whole
procedure is repeated, and so on.
Much care must be taken to keep the percolate clean of large (> 2 µm) soil particles, which would disturb the
investigation of the preparations, while particles smaller than 2 µm hardly disturb, if not too numerous. To get clean
material, note the following:
a) Usually, the percolating soil water which contains the organisms will be clean because the soil particles soon
become stabilized by microbial activities, mainly by fungal hyphae and bacterial mucus. Thus, extreme care
must be taken not to destroy the soil structure developed in the non-flooded Petri dish culture. Accordingly, the
Petri dish must be handled gently and, if necessary, distilled water sprinkled softly on the surface. To increase
percolation, mild finger pressure on the soil may be applied. Depending on the material sampled, the percolate
has a light brown to orange colour (from lignins, humus colloids, etc.), which does not disturb the preparations
(but see below).

b) The percolate is now gently shaken and large soil particles allowed to settle for about one minute. Then, the
supernatant, which is now ready for preparations, is collected with a Pasteur pipette. Be careful not to lose
bottom-dwellers. Occasionally, it may be helpful to sieve the percolate through a plankton net with 50–100
µm mesh-size or to concentrate it by mild centrifugation (max. 2000r/min for a few seconds), especially for
preparations with expensive chemicals (osmium tetroxide in Chatton-Lwoff silver nitrate impregnation).
9.1.3 Cultivation
All dileptids are predators feeding on other protists and small metazoans; cannibalism is not known.
Thus, co-cultivation of prey is required. Culture methods have been described for some dileptids by,
e.g., Visscher (1923), Doroszewski & golińska (1967), kink (1973), and in the present monograph (see
Dileptus sphagnicola and Pseudomonilicaryon fraterculum). Basically, the media used are simple, viz.,
yolk suspension and extracts of lettuce, hay, soil or beef providing growth of both, the dileptids and
the prey, usually Colpidium (now Dexiostoma) campylum and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Details will be
provided in the individual species descriptions.
Our experiences with pure cultures of dileptids and many other haptorids are frustrating: most clones either
die or grow poorly dying after one or two weeks. However, fairly good results are occasionally obtained
with semi-pure cultures set up with some ml of unfiltered soil percolate from the non-flooded Petri dish
culture and table water enriched with one to three crushed wheat grains to support growth of bacterivorous
ciliates, which then serve as a food for the dileptids contained. This simple method provided well-growing
cultures of, for instance, Apodileptus visscheri and Pseudomonilicaryon fraterculum. Further, masses of
dileptids occasionally develop in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures, showing division, conjugation, and
encystment.
9.2 Observing Living Ciliates
Many physical and chemical methods have been described for retarding the movement of ciliates in order
to observe structural details (see Foissner 1991 for literature). Chemical immobilization (e.g., nickel
sulphate) or physical slowing down by increasing the viscosity of the medium (e.g., methyl cellulose)
are, in our experience, usually unsuitable. These procedures often change the shape of the cell or cause
premortal alterations of various cell structures. The following simple method is therefore preferable: place
about 0.5 ml of the raw sample on a slide and pick out (collect) some specimens with a micropipette
under a compound microscope equipped with a low magnification (e.g., objective 4:1, eyepiece 10×).
If specimens are large enough, they can be collected from a Petri dish under a dissecting microscope.
Working with micropipettes, the diameter of which must be adjusted to the size of the specimens, requires
some training. The collected specimens are now in a very small drop of fluid. Apply small dabs of vaseline
(Petroleum jelly) to each of the four corners of a coverslip (or on the slide; it is useful to apply the jelly by
an ordinary syringe with a thick needle). Place this coverslip on the droplet containing the ciliates. Press
on the vaselined corners with a mounted needle until ciliates become slightly squeezed between slide
and coverslip (Figs 36a–d). As the pressure is increasing, the ciliates gradually become less mobile and
more transparent. Hence, first the location of the main cell organelles (e.g., nuclear and oral apparatus,
contractile vacuole) and then the details (e.g., extrusomes, micronucleus) can easily be observed under
low (×100–400) and high (×1000, oil immersion objective) magnifications.
The shape of the cells is of course altered by this procedure. Therefore, specimens taken directly from
the sample with a large-bore (opening ~ 1 mm) pipette must first be investigated under low magnification
(×100–400). Some species are too fragile to withstand handling with the micropipette and coverslip
trapping without deterioration. Investigation with low magnification also requires some experience
but it guarantees that undamaged cells are recorded. Video-microscopy is very useful at this point of

investigation, especially for registrating body shape and swimming behaviour.
A compound microscope equipped with differential interference contrast is best for observing living
ciliates. If not available, use bright-field or phase-contrast; the latter is only useful for very flat species.
9.3 Staining Procedures
Although there are numerous methods for staining ciliates, most of the older procedures (e.g., hematoxylin;
see kirBy 1950 for an excellent compilation of protocols) have been outdated by silver impregnation
techniques and electron microscopy. Various silver stains are available, but all need some experience
and are usually individually modified. However, familiarity with at least protargol impregnation and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is an absolute prerequisite for studying dileptid ciliates. These are
thus described in great detail in order also to give even beginners a fair chance to obtain usable slides.
Apart from silver impregnation, various other staining techniques are useful for taxonomic work with
ciliates, especially the Feulgen nuclear reaction and supravital staining with methyl green-pyronin in order
to reveal, respectively, the nuclear apparatus and the mucocysts.
Simple, viz., molecular formulae are given for the chemicals used, since usually only these are found in
the catalogues of the suppliers (e.g., Merck). In a laboratory manual it is thus convincing to use this style
too, instead of the more correct constitutional or structural formulae.
Supravital staining with methyl green-pyronin. This simple method is an excellent technique for revealing the
mucocysts of most ciliates (those of tetrahymenids and rather many haptorids, however, usually do not stain).
Mucocysts are stained deeply and very selectively blue or red, and can be observed in various stages of swelling
because the cells are not killed instantly. The nuclear apparatus is also stained.
Procedure
1. Pick out the desired ciliates with a micropipette and place the small drop of fluid in the centre of a slide.
2. Add an equally sized drop of methyl green-pyronin and mix the two drops gently by swiveling the slide.
Remarks: If ciliates were already mounted under the coverslip, add a drop of dye at one edge of the coverslip
and pass it through the preparation with a piece of filter paper placed at the other end of the coverslip.
89

3. Place a coverslip with vaselined corners on the preparation and squeeze specimens slightly.
Remarks: Observe immediately. Cells die in the stain within some minutes. Mucocysts stain very quickly
and many can be observed at various stages of swelling. To reveal the nuclear apparatus, cells should be
fairly strongly squashed (= flattened). The preparation is temporary. After 5–10 minutes the cytoplasm often
becomes heavily stained and obscures other details.
Reagents
1 g methyl green-pyronin (Chroma-company, Küferstrasse 2, P.O. Box 1110, D–73257 Köngen, Germany)
add 100 ml distilled water and filter
Remarks: This solution is very stable and can be used for years.
Protargol impregnation (protocol A in Foissner 1991 and recent experience). Protargol stains are indispensable
for descriptive research on ciliates. Many protargol methods have been described, and none is perfect. Here, the
variation which produces good results for dileptids in our laboratory is communicated. This procedure works well
with most ciliate and flagellate species (some, however, only rarely impregnate well, e.g., Loxodes, Paramecium) but
requires at least 20 specimens. Contrary to the silver carbonate method, a single specimen cannot usually be handled
successfully. Depending on the procedure used, protargol can reveal many cortical and internal structures, such as
basal bodies, cilia, various fibrillar systems, and the nuclear apparatus. The silverlines, however, never impregnate.
The shape of the cells is usually well preserved in permanent slides, which is an advantage for the investigation
but makes photographic documentation difficult. However, micrographs as clear as those taken from wet silver
carbonate impregnations can be obtained if the cells are scraped off, selected with a micropipette, put on a new slide,
pressed down with the coverslip, and photographed prior fixing with sodium thiosulphate. A centrifuge may be used
for step 2; staining jars (Fig. 36e) are necessary for steps 6–16. The procedure is complicated and subject to many
factors. Thus, be well organized and study the “Remarks” carefully.
The method described is basically the same as in Foissner (1991), with a small but important change: instead of using
distilled water, tap water is used in most steps. This avoids swelling and detachment of the albumen, a main problem
in the 1991 protocol. Further, a second developer, which produces more contrast, is introduced.
Procedure
1. Fix organisms in Bouin’s or Stieve’s fluid or in alcohol (50–100% depending on species and material), alcohol-
formalin, or in other fixatives for 10–30 minutes.
Remarks: To use the appropriate fixative is of paramount significance. Surprisingly, simple alcohol frequently
provides excellent impregnations, although shrinkage may be rather pronounced. Alcohol-formalin and
Champy’s and Da Fano’s fixatives are sometimes also useful. The fixation time has little influence on the
quality of the preparation within the limits given. Ratio fixative: sample fluid should be at least 1:1. Pour
ciliates into fixative, using a wide-necked dish to bring the organisms in contact with the fixative as fast as
possible. Most fixatives may be supplemented with some drops of 2% osmium tetroxide for better fixation of
fragile ciliates, e.g., the hypotrich Urosoma, which, however, fixes perfectly with alcohol. This increases the
stability of the cells but usually reduces their impregnability.
2. Concentrate by centrifugation and wash organisms 3–4 times in tap water.
Remarks: There are now two choices: either continue with step 3 or transfer the material through 30–50–70–
70% alcohol (ethanol) where it remains stable for years. Transfer preserved material back through the graded
alcohol series into tap water prior to continuing with the next step. Impregnability of preserved material may
be slightly different.
3. Clean 8 slides (or less if material is very scarce) per sample. The slides must be grease-free (clean with alcohol
and flame).
Remarks: Insufficiently cleaned slides may cause the albumen to detach. Mark slides on back if several
samples are prepared together. We use staining jars with 8 sections so that we can work with 16 slides
simultaneously by putting them back to back (Fig. 36e).
4. Put a small drop each of albumen-glycerol and concentrated organisms in the centre of a slide. Mix drops with a
mounted needle and spread over the middle third.
Remarks: Use about equally sized drops of albumen-glycerol and suspended (in tap water) organisms to
facilitate spreading. The size of the drops should be adjusted so that the middle third of the slide is covered
after spreading. Now remove sand grains, etc. The thickness of the albumen layer should be equal to that
90

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
of the organisms. Some thicker and thinner slides should, however, also be prepared because the thickness
of the albumen layer may influence the quality of the preparation. Cells may dry out and/or shrink if the
albumen layer is too thin; if it is too thick it may detach or the cells cannot be studied with the oil immersion
objective.
5. Allow slides to dry for at least 2 hours or overnight at room temperature.
Remarks: Slides may be allowed to dry for up to 48 hours; longer times decrease quality. Oven-dried (2 hours
at 60 °C) slides are usually also of poorer quality.
6. Place slides in a staining jar (Fig. 36e) filled with 95% alcohol (ethanol) for 20–30 minutes. Place a staining jar
with protargol solution into an oven (60 °C).
Remarks: Slides should not be transferred through an alcohol series into concentrated alcohol as this causes
the albumen layer to detach! Decrease hardening time to 15–20 minutes if the albumen is rather old and/or
not very sticky.
7. Rehydrate slides through 70% alcohol and two tap water steps for 5 minutes each.
8. Place slides in 0.2% potassium permanganate solution. Remove first slide (or pair of slides) after 30 seconds and
the others at 15 second intervals. Collect slides in a staining jar filled with tap water.
Remarks: Bleaching is by permanganate and oxalic acid (step 9). The procedure described above is necessary
because each species has its optimum bleaching time. The sequence in which slides are treated should be
recorded as the immersion time in oxalic acid must be proportional to that in the permanganate solution. The
albumen layer containing the organisms should swell slightly in the permanganate solution and the surface
should become uneven. If it remains smooth, the albumen is too sticky and this could decrease the quality of
the impregnation. If the albumen swells strongly, it is possibly too weak (old) and liable to detach. Use fresh
KMnO solution for each series.
4
9. Quickly transfer slides to 2.5% oxalic acid. Remove first slides (or pair of slides) after 60, 90, 120 and 160
seconds, the others at 20 second intervals. Collect slides in a staining jar filled with tap water.
Remarks: Same as for step 8! Albumen layer becomes smooth in oxalic acid. Hard tap water should be mixed
with distilled water 1:1.
10. Wash slides two times in tap water and one time in distilled water for 3 minutes each.
11. Place slides in the warm (60 °C) protargol solution and impregnate for 10–15 minutes at 60 °C.
Remarks: Protargol solution can be used only once. Organize 6 staining jars for developing the slides: distilled
water – tap water – tap water – fixative (sodium thiosulphate) – tap water – 70% alcohol – 100% alcohol
(ethanol).
12. Remove staining jar with the slides from the oven and take one slide from the mid of the series for adjusting the
developer. Dip the slide into distilled water for 1–2 seconds and then transfer it into the acetone developer. As soon
as the albumen turns yellowish, remove the slide, dip it into the first two tap water steps for about 2 seconds each,
and control the impregnation with the compound microscope. If the cells appear impregnated, then submerge the
slides in the fixative (sodium thiosulphate) for 5 minutes. If the cells appear not or too faintly impregnated, then
take a second slide from the staining jar and do the same procedure with the ordinary developer. If necessary,
adjust the developer (see reagents), and continue to develop the rest of the slides.
Remarks: We now use two different developers: the ordinary one and that proposed by Dieckmann (1995),
which is preferable but, for unknown reasons, does not work for all materials and fixatives. For instance, it
sometimes does not work with material that was not stored in 70% alcohol for a few days. In spite of this
problem, the Dieckmann developer should be tried first because it stains the cytoplasm weaker than the
ordinary developer, enhancing the contrast of the preparation. The impregnation intensity is sufficient if the
ciliary pattern is just recognizable. The permanent slide will be too dark if the ciliary pattern is distinct at
this stage of the procedure! The intensity of the impregnation can be controlled by the concentration of the
developer and the time of development: 5–10 seconds usually suffice for the diluted ordinary developer, while
20 seconds to 5 minutes, usually about 1 minute, are sufficient for the acetone developer! Some species (e.g.,
most microthoracids) must be treated with undiluted developer. Development time increases with bleaching
time. The thinner the albumen layer, the faster the development.
13. Fix slides in sodium thiosulphate for 5 min. Then wash in tap water three times for about 3 minutes each.
Remarks: Both, sufficient fixation and thorough wash out of the fixative are of paramount importance for the
stability of the preparation.

14. Transfer slides to 70% – 100% – 100% alcohol for 3–5 minutes each.
15. Clear by two 10 minute transfers through xylene.
16. Mount in synthetic neutral medium.
Remarks: Do not dry slides between steps 15 and 16. The preparation is stable, provided step 13 is done
correctly. The mounting medium should be rather viscous to avoid air-bubbles being formed when the solvent
evaporates during drying.
Reagents
a) Bouin’s fluid (prepare immediately before use; components can be stored)
15 parts saturated, aqueous picric acid (CHNO; preparation: add an excess of picric crystals to, e.g., 1 litre of
6 3 3 7
distilled water; shake solution several times within a week; some undissolved crystals should remain; filter
before use)
5 parts formalin (HCHO; commercial concentration, about 37%)
1 part glacial acetic acid (= concentrated acetic acid; CHO)
2 4 2
b) Stieve’s fluid (slightly modified; prepare immediately before use; components can be stored)
38 ml saturated, aqueous mercuric chloride (dissolve 60 g HgCl in 1 litre of boiling distilled water)
2
10 ml formalin (HCHO; commercial concentration, about 37%)
3 ml glacial acetic acid (= concentrated acetic acid; CHO)
2 4 2
c) Alcohol-formalin (prepare immediately before use; components can be stored)
50 ml 70% alcohol (ethanol)
5 ml formalin (HCHO; commercial concentration, about 37%)
Remarks: The two components can be used in a wide variation of concentrations, even vice versa. Further,
they can be used individually in various concentrations. The often excellent results obtained with pure alcohol
fixation are partially caused by the poor preservation of the cytoplasm, that then impregnates only faintly,
enhancing the contrast of the cortical structures.
d) Albumen-glycerol (2–6 month stability at 3 °C)
15 ml egg albumen
15 ml concentrated (98–100%) glycerol (CHO)
3 8 3
Remarks: Pre-treatment of the egg albumen and preparation of the albumen-glycerol: Separate the white
carefully from the yolk and embryo of three eggs (free range eggs are preferable to those from battery
chickens, whose egg white is less stable and sticky). Shake the white by hand (do not use a mixer!) for a
minute in a narrow-mouthed 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask until a stiff white foam is formed. Allow the flask to
stand for 30–60 seconds. Then pour the viscous rest of the egg white in a second Erlenmeyer flask and shake
again until a stiff foam is formed. Repeat until most of the egg white is either stiff or becomes watery; usually
4–6 Erlenmeyer flasks of foam are obtained. Leave all flasks undisturbed for about 10 minutes and discard the
watery albumen from the last flask. During this time a glycerol-like fluid percolates from the foam. This fluid
is collected and used. Add an equal volume of concentrated glycerol and a small thymol crystal (C H O) for
10 14
preservation of the mixture. Mix by shaking gently and pour mixture into a small flask. Leave undisturbed
for two weeks in the refrigerator. A whitish slime settles at the bottom of the flask. Decant the clear portion,
discard slime and thymol crystal. Store it at about 3 °C. A “good“ albumen-glycerol drags a short thread when
touched with a needle. The albumen is too thin (not sticky enough) or too old if this thread is not formed.
Fresh albumen which is too thin may be concentrated by leaving it open for some weeks so that water can
evaporate. If the albumen is too sticky, which may cause only one side of the organisms to impregnate well,
it is diluted with distilled water or old, less sticky albumen to the appropriate consistency. The preparation of
the albumen-glycerol must be undertaken with great care because much depends on its quality. Unfortunately,
all commercial products which we have tried detach during impregnation.

add 0.4–0.8 g protargol
Remarks: Use light-brown “protargol for microscopy” presently hardly available but some companies showed
interest to produce it again. Some dark-brown, cheaper products do not work! Sprinkle powder on the surface
of the water of a wide-mouthed bottle and allow to dissolve without stirring. Concentration of the protargol
depends on its “strength”, that is, on the silver contents.
h) Ordinary developer (mix in sequence indicated; sodium sulphite must be dissolved before hydroquinone is
added)
95 ml distilled water
5 g sodium sulphite (NaSO)
2 3
1 g hydroquinone (CHO)
6 6 2
Remarks: This recipe yields the stock solution which is stable for some weeks and should be used undiluted
for certain ciliates (step 12). Usually, however, it must be diluted with tap water in a ratio of 1:20 to 1:50
to avoid too rapid development and one-sided impregnation of the organisms. Freshly prepared developer
is usually inadequate (the albumen turns greenish instead of brownish). The developer should thus be aged
artificially by adding some sodium carbonate (NaCO) or by adding 1 ml old, slightly brownish stock solution
2 3
to 99 ml fresh developer. Alternatively, air-aged solutions can be used, that is, a developer that has been kept
uncovered for some days in a wide-mouthed bottle. It first turns yellowish, then light brown (most effective)
and later dark brown and viscous (at this stage the developer has lost most of its activity but is still suitable for
artificial ageing of fresh developer (see above). Take great care with the developer as its quality contributes
highly to that of the slides. If the developer has lost its activity (which is not always indicated by a brown
colour!), the silver is not or only insufficiently reduced and the organisms stain too faintly. A fresh developer
should therefore be prepared for each “impregnation week“ and some old developer kept.
Acetone developer (stable for about two weeks; add components in the series given and solve each before adding
the next)

0.3 g hydroquinone (CHO)
6 6 2
2 g sodium sulphite (NaSO)

15 ml acetone
Remarks: This is the low-speed developer used by Dieckmann (1995), who obtained the recipe by FryD-
VersaVel (pers. comm.). Pour the developer into a staining jar and immerse slides, one by one, controlling
impregnation intensity when the albumen becomes light brown or light green. See step 12 for details.
i) Fixative for impregnation (stable for several years)
50 g sodium thiosulphate (NaSO·5HO) are dissolved in 1000 ml distilled water
2 2 3 2
Silver nitrate impregnation (Foissner 1991 and recent experience). This method can provide excellent results but
has several problems: (i) the gelatin, in which the specimens are embedded, is too weak, i.e., does not become solid
sufficiently, and the preparations are lost or full of clouds; (ii) the gelatin becomes cloudy and/or gets small fissures
above the individual cells, even if “good” gelatin is used; (iii) the impregnation is too faint, especially on the “back
side”, that is, the side oriented to the microscope slide; and (iv) the impregnation bleaches more or less strongly
within a few days or months.
Problem (i) can be solved by using “Gelatin, from Bovine Bone”, Wako company, Japan. Problem (ii) occurs when
the preparation becomes too warm, i.e., when the gelatin commences melting. Thus, keep the preparation < 10 °C
throughout the procedure. Problem (iii) is partially caused by the inability of the UV-light to penetrate sufficiently
the gelatin and the cells. Thus, silver reduction must be done from above and below (see step 12) and chemical
development should follow UV reduction. The fourth problem we solved only recently (see steps 13–15). It makes
the protocol rather complex but is worth to be done because stable preparations can be obtained. Several slides should
be prepared simultaneously from the same material. If only few specimens are available, these must be handled with
micropipettes during steps 1–7 (difficult task!); for ample material a centrifuge may be used. Until dehydration (step
16), keep all solutions cold (< 10 °C) as warming causes clouds or even detaches the gelatin from the slide. The Da
93

Fano solution is of paramount significance because it decides about the strength of the impregnation. If too much is
used, precipitations may develop; if too less, the impregnation may become too faint. The method is not simple and
requires experience. Since some steps must be done quickly, it is necessary to be well organized.
Procedure
1. If possible, concentrate ciliates by gentle centrifugation (the fixative is expensive) or collect individual ciliates
and drop them into the fixative.
2. Put ciliates into Champy’s fluid and fix for 1–30 minutes.
Remarks: The ratio of material to fixative should be at least 1:1, better 1:2. The fixation time apparently does
not influence the results greatly. We usually fix for about 10 minutes. Fixation should be carried out in a fume
hood since osmic vapours are highly toxic.
3. Remove fixative by centrifugation or micropipette and postfix in Da Fano’s fluid for at least 5 minutes. Continue
this replacement until the solution is the colour of Da Fano’s fluid (2–3 times are usually enough).
Remarks: Material can be stored in Da Fano’s fluid for years.
4. Place a very clean, grease-free slide on a hot-plate (35–60 °C).
Remarks: The slides must be grease-free (clean with alcohol and flame); even commercially pre-cleaned
slides should be cleaned with a alcohol-moist cloth.
5. Place a small piece (about 2–4 mm in diameter) of gelatin in centre of the warmed slide and allow to melt.
Remarks: Gelatin should have been stored in the refrigerator for at least one week before use. Fresh gelatin
may cause cloudy silver deposits.
6. Quickly add an equal-sized or smaller drop of concentrated specimens to the molten gelatin and remove slide
from hot-plate.
Remarks: Use as few Da Fano’s fluid as possible. Mix organisms thoroughly into the gelatin using a mounted
needle.
7. Quickly spread the drop on the slide or remove excess fluid under the dissecting microscope with a warmed
micropipette until ciliates remain just nicely embedded in a thin gelatin layer.
Remarks: Steps 6 and 7 must be done quickly to avoid hardening and/or desiccation of the gelatin; if gelatin
solidifies during the procedure return the slide to the hot-plate for a few seconds. Excess fluid can be removed
only if ciliates are large. For small (< 100 µm) species and generally it is more convenient to spread the drop
over the slide until the gelatin layer has the appropriate thickness. If the drop does not spread well, the slide
is not grease-free. The gelatin layer must be thin to allow the silver nitrate and UV-light to pass through.
Material should be well concentrated. If too much Da Fano’s fluid has been used or remains, precipitations
develop or the gelatin detaches.
8. Immediately transfer slide to a cold, moist chamber (e.g., a covered Petri dish with damp filter paper covering its
bottom). Leave for about 5 minutes until gelatin has hardened.
Remarks: Gelatin must be hardened (check with the tip of a mounted needle under dissecting microscope if
in doubt) but must not desiccate and/or freeze. Desiccated or frozen slides are of poor quality. Harden gelatin
in refrigerator or by placing the moist chamber on ice.
9. Flush slide in cold distilled water for 3–10 seconds.
Remarks: This step is essential and determines the quality and intensity of the impregnation. If the gelatin
is washed too long, the impregnation may become too faint; if it is insufficiently washed coarse silver
precipitations cover the gelatin. It is recommended that at least 4 slides, washed 3, 5, 7 and 10 seconds,
respectively, are prepared.
10. Immediately transfer slide to cold silver nitrate solution for 30–60 minutes.
Remarks: Keep silver nitrate solution cold, as warming melts and detaches the gelatin from the slide. 30
minutes impregnation suffices for large ciliates (e.g., Paramecium). Immersion of more than 60 minutes
intensifies impregnation only slightly and may cause darkening of cytoplasmic inclusions. The gelatin layer
becomes slightly milky in the silver nitrate solution. A distinct milky coat indicates that too much Da Fano’s
fluid has been used and/or remained (step 7).
11. Flush slide with cold distilled water for a minute.
12. Immediately submerge slide in an ~ 2 cm high layer of cold distilled water. Irradiate slides for 30 minutes each
from above and below to obtain fully impregnated cells, using ultraviolet sources (< 254 nm) placed 5–15 cm
94

above and below the slides until gelatin turns golden brown.
Remarks: Tilt dish gently back and forth and change water after 2–3 minutes of irradiation to avoid silver
precipitations. Take care that water remains cold (<10 °C).
13. After UV-irradiation, put slides for 15 minutes in cold ordinary protargol developer diluted 1:1 with distilled
water.
14. Wash slides in cold distilled water for 3 minutes.
15. Immerse slides in the cold silver fixer (sodium thiosulphate) used for protargol impregnation for 5 minutes.
16. Wash slides five times in cold distilled water for about 10 hours; keep the preparation cool in the refrigerator.
Remarks: Washing out the chemicals from the developer and fixer is of paramount significance for stabilizing
the preparation.
17. Transfer slides to chilled 30% and then 70% alcohol (ethanol) for 10 minutes each.
18. Complete dehydration by two transfers at least 10 minutes long through 100% alcohol (ethanol) at room
temperature.
Remarks: The gelatin hardens, the alcohol needs not be chilled. Dehydrate thoroughly to avoid milky “water
spots” in the mounted slides.
19. Clear by 2 transfers of at least 10 minutes through xylene.
Remarks: A prolonged stay in xylene (e.g., 2 days) sometimes produces extremely clear preparations.
20. Mount in synthetic neutral mounting medium.
Remarks: Do not dry slides between steps 19 and 20! The mounting medium should be rather viscous to
avoid air-bubbles being formed when the solvent evaporates during drying. If air-bubbles develop in the
mounted and hardened slide, re-immerse in xylene for some days until the coverslip drops off. Remount
using a more viscous medium and remove materials protruding from the gelatin. Usually, some air-
bubbles are found immediately after mounting; these can be pushed to the edge of the coverslip with a
finger or mounted needle. The preparation is stable. However, the drop margin may bleach more or less.
The infraciliature should stand out dark brown or black against the light brown-coloured gelatin and the
unstained cytoplasm. Silver deposits on the gelatin surface indicate that too much Da Fano’s fluid remained
(steps 7–9).
Reagents
a) Champy’s fixative (prepare shortly before use; 9 ml of the fluid usually suffice for 1–2 fixations; use fume
hood)
7 parts (3.5 ml) 1% aqueous chromic acid (CrO)
3
7 parts (3.5 ml) 3% aqueous potassium dichromate (KCrO)
2 2 7
4 parts (2.0 ml) 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide (OsO)
4
b) Da Fano’s fluid (stable for several years; large amounts can thus be prepared)
900 ml distilled water (or sea-water, without additional NaCl, for marine ciliates)
10 g cobalt nitrate (Co(NO)·6HO)
3 2 2
100ml formalin (HCHO; commercial concentration, about 37%)
10 g sodium chloride (NaCl)
c) Gelatin (may be used as long as not colonized by bacteria or fungi; the molten gelatin must be clear and yellowish
in colour; use a good product!)
10 g powered gelatin
0.1 g sodium chloride (NaCl)
100 ml distilled water
Remarks: Mix these components and melt gelatin in a water bath, stirring frequently. Pour mixture into small,
sterile cups and store them in the refrigerator. Filled cups can be used for years.
d) Silver nitrate solution (may be used for several preparations, i.e., for about 40 slides if these are made on the same
day; used solutions older than 1 day may cause problems)
3 g silver nitrate (AgNO)
3
add 100 ml distilled water

The following materials must be prepared on the day preceding the preparation:
a) Salinated gelatin
b) Osmium tetroxide (takes about 10 hours to dissolve)
c) Chill a moist chamber, i.e., a large Petri dish (step 12); the reduction dish; the silver nitrate solution; distilled
water; the chemical developer and fixer; and alcohol (30%, 70%) in appropriate amounts.
Preparation for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Ciliate species cannot usually be identified solely by
scanning electron microscopy because only a limited number of characters is revealed. However, SEM is useful for
the beginner by allowing a three-dimensional view of the specimen and for the specialist in documenting details
which are difficult to reveal with other methods. Only the method used by ourselves is described here; it changed
considerably since Foissner (1991). See textbooks for general SEM-techniques.
Procedure
1. Pour ciliates into Parducz’ fixative and leave for about 30 minutes.
Remarks: Concentrate and clean material as thoroughly as possible (see step 2). Ratio of sample:fixative
should be at least 1:1, better 1:2. Add some drops of 5 n HCl if fixative becomes milky when the material is
added. Fixation must be done in a wide-mouthed bottle so that the organisms come in contact with the fixative
immediately. Then put the fixed sample in a narrow glass tube (diameter ~ 2 cm), where the organisms can settle.
Parducz’ fluid preserves most ciliates very well. However, the cirri of the hypotrich ciliates usually disintegrate
into their component cilia. Hypotrichs should thus be fixed either in concentrated sublimate (dissolve 60 g
HgCl in 1 litre hot distilled water and allow to cool) or in a mixture composed of 4 parts concentrated
2
sublimate and 1 part 2% osmium tetroxide. A much better fixative for hypotrichs is that used by Barry
wicklow (pers. comm.): mix equal amounts of 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide and 3% glutaraldehyde and fix
cells for 15–30 min. Wash in distilled water and proceed as described below (steps 2–7). Unfortunately, such
material cannot be stored because crystals are formed. Thus, critical point drying must follow immediately.
The fixative preserves also many other ciliates well, although the metachronal ciliary waves are frequently
not as distinct as with Parducz’ fluid.
2. Wash and clean the material (ciliates or other protists) in tap water.
Remarks: Washing must be done in a watch-glass (Fig. 36f) and with a micropipette to remove bacteria and
organic debris. This cleaning of the material is essential but rather difficult and laborious, especially with
small species (< 100 µm) and field material; thus cultures and/or pre-cleaned material (see below) should be
used. The cleaning is performed as follows: Ciliates settle at the bottom of the fixation tube after 30 minutes
(step 1). Remove as much supernatant as possible with a pipette (use a centrifuge only if the specimens did
not settle well). Then transfer the material to a watch-glass and allow to settle for about 5 minutes (use fume
hood). Quickly remove most of the fixative with a micropipette under the dissecting microscope. Now wash
the ciliates with tap water by several passages through a large-bore (diameter about 1 mm) pipette. Bacteria
and debris adhering to the ciliates are hereby mechanically removed. Again allow to settle, but control
sedimentation with the dissecting microscope; remove supernatant containing bacteria and debris with a
micropipette as soon as ciliates have settled. This procedure must be repeated until the material is clean. Use
fractionated sedimentation if the sample contains several species differing in size and/or mass.
Field material: Larger species (> 100 µm) are picked out with a micropipette and collected in a small
bottle. Then pour the fixative over the cells. Several hundred specimens must be collected because loss of
material may be considerable during the following steps. Small species can be prepared by this method only
if abundant material is available. Some accumulation can often be achieved by the following simple method:
leave a freshly collected sample containing ample mud to stand for some hours at room temperature. Due to
oxygen depletion the ciliates usually move to the surface where they can be skimmed off with a teaspoon.
3. Transfer the cleaned ciliates with a small drop of tap water into the preparation chamber (Fig. 37).
Remarks: Place a small amount of commercial cotton wool on the bottom plankton net of the chamber. Then
put a drop of specimens into the cotton and load the preparation with washer 1. The net must be dry to avoid
spreading of the drop to the chamber margin and the washer. Place the top plankton net carefully on the drop,
that is, on washer 1, using forceps. Weight top net with washer 2, close chamber with lid and immediately
transfer into 30% ethanol. The plankton net must have a mesh-size < 12 µm and can be used many times. It
should fit exactly into the chamber, which is best achieved using an appropriate punch. Alternatively, metal
grids with 10–20 µm mesh size, as used by soil scientists, can be applied. They are stable for years.

The cleaned material can be stored in ~ 1% osmium tetroxide for years. However, when the fixative contained
aldehyds (formalin, glutaraldehyde), the osmium should be changed two or three times within the first month,
otherwise it becomes black from remnants of the fixative.
4. Dehydrate chamber with ciliates in an ethanol series (30–50–70–90–100–100%) for 5 minutes each.
5. Dry chamber with ciliates in a critical-point drying apparatus.
Remarks: We use CO and change the alcohol at least 10 times. Amylacetate, as used previously (Foissner
2
1991), proved to be superfluous.
6. Use a mouth protection fabric and put a glass shield between the dissecting microscope and the sample to avoid
any rewetting of the dried organisms by your breath! Open chamber and place ciliates on a SEM-stub.
Remarks: The dried ciliates usually form small lumps in the cotton wool. The cotton and the net are carefully
transferred with forceps to the SEM-stub, where the organisms are separated from the cotton and the net by
knocking on the forceps. If there are small lumps of organisms, they can be dispersed under the dissecting
microscope with a mounted eyelash. The ciliates spread easily if cleaning and drying were sufficient.
Preparation of the SEM-stub: We use commercial aluminium SEM-stubs with 25 mm in diameter.
To fix the organisms and to get a black, homogenous background the stub is covered with a graphit-tab
available from several providers, e.g., the Gröpl Company, Frauenhofnerstrasse 40, A-3430 Tulln, Austria
(order no. G 3347 or G 3348, i.e., tabs with a diameter of 12 or 25 mm). Note that small species (< 30 µm)
tend to sink into the graphit. For these, the graphit-tabs are pre-sputtered 3 times with gold.
7. Sputter with gold. This is a very critical step! Use low (4 mA) sputter energy. Sputter about 10 times for 30 seconds
each, with breaks of about 5 minutes to avoid heating. Cilia become curled and denaturated if sputter energy is
too high and/or the sample is slightly rewetted by your breath or perspiration!

B Systematic Section
1 How to Use the Monograph?
A few technical explanations are necessary for the proper use of the monograph.
(i) The original descriptions are either cited literally or are adapted to the style used in this monograph.
In the latter case, great care was taken to add or remove nothing. Further, we included computer scans
of all illustrations, even those of poor quality, so that the species is shown as originally published.
(ii) We quantified several features in three or more steps, for instance, the distance of the ciliary rows
(Fig. 10): very narrowly to narrowly spaced (≤ 4 µm), ordinarily spaced (4–8 µm), widely to very
widely spaced (≥ 8 µm). Usually, we left “ordinary” when the kinety distance was within the range
given.
(iii) Usually, authors and dates are omitted from the names of the species in the Remarks section because
this information is found in the individual species descriptions.
(iv) For the species/subspecies concept used, see Foissner & Xu (2007).
(v) Orders, families, genera, and species are arranged according to their appearance in the taxonomic
keys.
(vi) With few exceptions, pre-ehrenBerg (1838) taxa or synonyms are not included in the synonymy
lists.
2 A User-Friendly Flow Chart Key to 66 Dileptid Species
The key contains the 66 dileptids considered identifiable in this monograph. It is easy to use because all
characters asked are shown and can be recognized in live specimens, using bright field or interference
contrast microscopy. Reliable identification of dileptids requires detailed observation of body size and
shape (e.g., length:width ratio, shape and proportion of proboscis to body length, shape of posterior body
end), the nuclear and contractile vacuole apparatus as well as the extrusome shape and pattern. Body
shape and the arrangement of the contractile vacuoles can be easily observed at low magnification (about
×100–400), while macronucleus and extrusomes must be studied at high magnification (oil immersion
objective). Keep in mind that the shape of the cells is altered under coverslip pressure. Further, the
euplanktonic dileptids (Paradileptus elephantinus and Pelagodileptus trachelioides) become rapidly
morbid and globular when transferred onto the slide. Therefore, fresh specimens must be taken from the
sample with a large-bore (opening ~ 1 mm) pipette and first investigated under low magnification.
All identifications should be checked against the detailed descriptions in the systematic section, especially,
against the chapters “taxonomy” and “remarks”. These contain important notes on distinguishing the
species from its nearest relatives and/or other similar-looking taxa. Further, in these chapters the most
important and outstanding features of the species are emphasized and discussed. Only if all important
traits match, the identification can be considered as reliable. If you are insecure at a certain couplet follow
both leads, or be aware of having discovered a not yet described species or genus.
On the ten key plates, we provide/show the following data/features for each species: body shape and size
range; nuclear apparatus (shaded black); arrangement of contractile vacuoles (depicted as clear circles);
and extrusomes (if data available). If a certain species has two types of extrusomes, both are shown and
usually placed left of the proboscis. The larger and/or more conspicuous type is referred to as type I.

Subclass Rhynchostomatia Jankowski, 1980
1975 Rhynchostomatida (Dileptida) Jankowski, Konspekt novoj sistemy Ciliophora: 26 (a nomen nudum due to
lack of description or definition)
1980 Rhynchostomata subcl. nov. Jankowski, Trudy zool. Inst., Leningr. 94: 105 (very brief characterization)
2011 Rhynchostomatia Jankowski, 1980 – Vďačný, orsi, BourlanD, shimano, ePstein & Foissner, Eur. J. Protistol.
47: 309 (improved diagnosis)
Diagnosis: Free-living Litostomatea with body partitioned into proboscis and trunk with or without tail.
At least two dorsal contractile vacuoles. Oral bulge opening ventral at base of proboscis. Oral ciliary
pattern complex, i.e., right branch of circumoral kinety accompanied by at least one perioral kinety, left
branch by many minute, oblique preoral kineties, forming a single perioral-like kinety in some species.
Type order (by subsequent designation): Dileptida Jankowski, 1978.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Derived from the Greek nouns rhynchos (proboscis) and
stoma (mouth), obviously referring to the oral bulge opening at the base of the proboscis.
Remarks: The Rhynchostomatida were introduced with ordinal rank by Jankowski (1975) but without
any definition, and are thus unavailable (Article 13.1 of the ICZN 1999). Although Jankowski (1980)
established the subclass Rhynchostomata validly five years later, he dropped it in Jankowski (2007).
Vďačný et al. (2011b) resurrected and redefined the Rhynchostomata changing its suffix to -ia, as usual
for ciliate subclasses (lynn 2008).
Based on both morphological and molecular data, Vďačný et al. (2011b) recognized two orders within the
Rhynchostomatia: Tracheliida and Dileptida. Tracheliids are easily distinguished in vivo from dileptids
by body shape (broadly ovoidal vs. narrow to rod-like) and the presence (vs. absence) of a lateral fossa.
Further, the proboscis of the tracheliids is immobile and short, and thus less conspicuous than that of the
dileptids (Fig. 38).
Key to Orders
1 Body ovoidal and with fossa on right side. Proboscis immobile or only slightly mobile, its dorsal
side distinctly shorter than the ventral one ..................................................... Tracheliida (p. 110)
– Body oblong or rostrate, without fossa. Proboscis agile, its ventral and dorsal side of similar
length .................................................................................................................Dileptida (p. 142)
Fig. 38: Comparison of proboscis in tracheliids and typical
dileptids. The proboscis of the tracheliids is short because its
dorsal side is much shorter than the ventral one. OB – oral
bulge, OO – oral bulge opening, PB – pharyngeal basket.

Order Tracheliida Vďačnýet al., 2011
2011 Tracheliida ord. n. Vďačný, orsi, BourlanD, shimano, ePstein & Foissner, Eur. J. Protistol. 47: 310
Diagnosis: Body broadly dileptid. Proboscis immobile or only slightly mobile, its dorsal side distinctly
shorter than the ventral one. A distinct groove (fossa) on right side containing and surrounded by condensed
somatic ciliature. Dorsal brush not staggered and three- to four-rowed. Circumoral kinety dikinetidal
throughout. Internal oral basket clavate.
Type family (by original designation): Tracheliidae ehrenBerg, 1838.
Etymology: Composite of the stem of the generic name Trachelius and the order suffix -ida.
Remarks: The order Tracheliida comprises a single family with two monotypic genera: Trachelius and
Apotrachelius nov. gen. They share two unique features, viz., a lateral fossa and a strongly developed,
clavate internal oral basket composed of innumerable fine fibres. Further, their proboscis appears shorter
when compared with that of typical dileptids because its dorsal side is much shorter than the ventral one
(Fig. 38). Tracheliids display several traits that have not been found in other dileptids but are common
in most haptorians: (i) the circumoral kinety is dikinetidal throughout (vs. monokinetidal around oral
bulge opening) and (ii) the dorsal brush is not staggered (vs. staggered). These features are very likely
plesiomorphies inherited from the last common ancestor of the Litostomatea, supporting the basal position
of the tracheliids within the subclass Rhynchostomatia as shown in the cladistic and molecular phylogenetic
analyses (for details, see General section and Vďačný et al. 2011b).

Nomenclature and taxonomy: schrank (1803) established the genus Trachelius with eight poorly
described nominal species (Table 21); he did not fix a type species. claParèDe & lachmann (1859)
redefined Trachelius and confined it to a single species, T. ovum; Fromentel (1875) followed. However,
T. ovum is not eligible to be fixed as the type species because it was not originally included in the genus
Trachelius (Article 67.2 of the ICZN 1999). At present, only T. cicer, which is a senior synonym of T.
ovum but a nomen oblitum (see below), may be declared as type species. According to Article 67.1.2 of
the ICZN (1999), the name of a type species remains unchanged even when it is a junior synonym or
homonym, or a suppressed name. Thus, we fix T. cicer as the type species of the genus Trachelius. We
shall bid the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to use its plenary power to fix T.
ovum as the type species of Trachelius.
Trachelius has two objective synonyms, Ophryocerca and Harmodirus, which ehrenBerg (1831) and
Perty (1852) founded on the same species, Trachelius ovum. aPstein (1915) proposed the genus as nomen
conservandum.
There is only one other genus similar to Trachelius, viz., Apotrachelius nov. gen., which differs by the many
scattered macronuclear nodules (vs. mononucleate), the absence (vs. presence) of oral bulge extrusomes,
and the paradileptid (vs. dileptid) oral bulge opening. From all other dileptid genera, Trachelius is easily
distinguished in vivo by body shape (ovoid vs. oblong or rostrate) and the presence (vs. absence) of a
lateral fossa.
Improved diagnosis: Small- to medium-sized Tracheliidae with broad body. Macronucleus dumbbell-
shaped. With oral bulge extrusomes. Oral bulge opening dileptid.
Type species (by subsequent designation): Trachelius cicer schrank, 1803. However, Ophryocerca ovum
ehrenBerg, 1831 will be proposed to be fixed as the type species of Trachelius under the plenary power
of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Derived from the Greek noun trachelos (throat). Masculine
gender.
Remarks: Altogether 29 species were originally described or combined with Trachelius (Table 21).
However, we recognize only one, T. ovum, which has eight synonyms. Fourteen Trachelius species were
transferred to other genera and twelve remained indeterminate. Recently, lin et al. (2004) neotypified
Amphileptus gutta cohn, 1866, which was combined with Trachelius by hamBurger & BuDDenBrock
(1911), as Orthodonella gutta (cohn, 1866) kahl, 1931.

Nomenclature and taxonomy: Trachelius ovum (ehrenBerg, 1831) ehrenBerg, 1833 was originally
described as T. cicer by schrank (1803). However, T. cicer does not take precedence over the younger
name, T. ovum, because both conditions of Article 23.9.1 of the ICZN (1999) are met: (i) T. cicer schrank,
1803 has been not used after 1899 and (ii) the junior synonym, T. ovum (ehrenBerg, 1831) ehrenBerg,
1833, has been used in at least 25 works, published by at least ten authors in the immediately preceding
fifty years, encompassing a span of not less than ten years (see list of synonyms). Thus, T. cicer becomes
a nomen oblitum and T. ovum a nomen protectum.
According to schewiakoFF (1896), Trachelius ovum has seven synonyms (for details, see synonymy list
above): Amphileptus rotundus, Amphileptus ovum, Harmodirus ovum, Ophryocerca ovum, Trachelius
cicer, Trachelius leidyi, and Trachelius vorax (= Amphileptus vorax). This was accepted by kahl (1931)
and Foissner et al. (1995). We add the binucleate Trachelius subtilis PenarD, 1922 because there is strong
indication that PenarD (1922) misinterpreted the nuclear pattern, as the macronucleus of T. ovum is often
strongly mid-constricted, thus appearing as two abutting nodules in vivo.
There is only one other ciliate similar to T. ovum, viz., Apotrachelius multinucleatus described below,
which differs by the many macronuclear nodules (vs. one nodule), the absence (vs. presence) of oral
extrusomes, and the saltwater (vs. freshwater) habitat.
Improved diagnosis (neotype population): Size about 350 × 175 μm in vivo. Shape broadly dileptid with
broadly rounded posterior end, proboscis oral bulge about 1/3 of body length. Macronucleus dumbbell-
shaped, several globular micronuclei. Many scattered contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each. Extrusomes
attached to proboscis oral bulge, almost rod-shaped, about 4 μm long. On average 100 ciliary rows, 3
anteriorly differentiated into a distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush, monokinetidal tail of row 3 extends to
117

third fourth of body. Oral bulge opening about 20 μm across. Preoral kineties oblique, ordinarily spaced,
each usually composed of 3 narrowly spaced cilia. Freshwater.
Type locality: ehrenBerg (1831) discovered Trachelius ovum in a pond from the Zoological Garden
of Berlin, Germany, E13°19’ N52°30’. The neotype is from the Eger stream, Fichtelgebirge, Bavaria,
Germany, E14°8’ N50°32’ (Foissner 1997a). According to Article 76.3 of the ICZN (1999), the place of
origin of the neotype becomes the type locality of the nominal species-group taxon, despite any previously
published statement of the type locality.
Type material: Foissner (1997a) deposited four neotype slides (inv. nos 1998/69–72) with protargol-
impregnated German specimens in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI).
Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Gene sequence: The 18S rRNA gene sequence of a Salzburg population has been deposited in GenBank
(HM581673). The sequence is 1636 nucleotides long and has a GC content of 42.3%. It is a consensus
sequence based on 21 clones.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The specific epithet ovum (egg) obviously refers to body
shape.
Description: All known and some new data are put together because the morphological conspecificity is
beyond reasonable doubt for most populations mentioned in the list of synonyms. The review emphasizes
the old, detailed studies of FaBre-Domergue (1891) and hamBurger (1903) as well as the recent studies of
song & wilBert (1989) and Foissner (1997a); the last study is considered an authoritative redescription
because detailed data and neotype slides were provided.
Size in vivo similar in most populations, usually about 250–400 × 75–350 μm. Length 360 μm (ehrenBerg
1831); 390 μm (DuJarDin 1841); 145–435 μm (Perty 1852); 450 μm (kent 1881); 127 μm (maskell
1887); up to 400 μm (Bütschli 1889, Blochmann 1895); usually 300–370 μm, rarely up to 600 μm (FaBre-
Domergue 1891); 300–600 μm (schewiakoFF 1896, rouX 1901); 390 μm (hamBurger & BuDDenBrock
1911); 295 µm (smith 1914); 250–400 μm (PenarD 1922); 615 μm (scheFFelt 1922); 200–400 μm (kahl
1931, Bick 1972); 300–480 μm (wang & nie 1933); 190–240 μm (lePşi 1957b); 340 μm (chorik 1968);
380 μm (hollowDay 1979); 150–200 µm (kusano 1985). kahl (1931) and Biernacka (1959) observed
dwarf forms 60–70 μm and 85 μm long, respectively.
Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape broadly to narrowly dileptid, that is, length:width ratio on
average 1.9:1 (1.2–3.7:1), according to the figures available in the literature and our own data based on
in vivo micrographs, protargol preparations, and SEM micrographs (Table 22). Proboscis inconspicuous,
conical with anterior portion usually curved dorsally, only slightly motile; length of proboscis oral bulge
highly variable, viz., 20% to 57% of body length, on average about 36% (Table 22). Trunk almost globular,
rarely oblong, left side convex, right side sometimes conspicuously flattened, especially in under-nourished
cells (Figs 39a–m, 40a–d, g, 41a–c, 42t, x, v, 43a, b1, b2, c1, d, e1, f, h, i, 44a–d, f, i, k, q, r, u, w, 45a–g,
n–p). Rather sensitive to coverslip pressure, that is, cells round up and throw off the proboscis, sometimes
concomitantly ejecting food vacuoles and cytoplasm to reduce the volume and swim away (ehrenBerg
1838, hamBurger 1903).
On right side, in mid-portion of trunk, a unique organelle called groove or fossa. Fossa elliptical, about
25–35 × 10–15 μm in size after protargol impregnation; contains and is surrounded by condensed somatic
ciliature, some ciliary rows end at fossa margin, while others extend to its bottom and proceed posteriorly
(Figs 43b3, 44g, i, w, x, 45k). Function of fossa not known. BalBiani (1888) considered it as a mouth,
which was refuted by FaBre-Domergue (1891); hamBurger (1903) and PenarD (1922) observed that
Trachelius attaches to the stalk of peritrich prey, using the fossa as a sucker; kahl (1931) speculated that
118

the fossa regulates the cell volume and considered the fossa ciliature as thigmotactic.
Nuclear apparatus usually in centre of trunk, may be displaced by large food items. Macronucleus highly
variable in shape: dumbbell-like (Figs 40e, 43h, 44f, i, u, 45f–h), cylindroidal-curved (Figs 41a, c, 42c,
43a, b1, b2, e1, f), ellipsoidal (Figs 39g, j, 43w, 44d), or reniform (Figs 44a, b). smith (1914), PenarD
(1922), kahl (1931), wang & nie (1933), nusch (1974), and song & wilBert (1989) likely misinterpreted
the dumbbell-like macronucleus as two abutting nodules (Figs 40d, 42t, x, 43c1, c2, d, 44e, k, q). Size of
macronucleus given only by Foissner (1997a), that is, 75 × 20 μm (Table 22). Nucleoli evenly distributed,
small and globular (Figs 40e, 41i, 45h). Micronuclei close or attached to macronucleus, about 3.5 μm
across, often difficult to distinguish from similarly sized and stained cytoplasmic inclusions, number thus
difficult to determine: one according to PenarD (1922), Bick (1972), hollowDay (1979), and song &
wilBert (1989), while nine according to Bütschli (1889), five to thirteen according to hamBurger (1903),
and two to five according to Foissner (1997a).
Contractile vacuole pattern identical in most populations (for exceptions, see “non T. ovum” in the
synonymy list), i.e., many vacuoles scattered underneath cell surface of trunk and proboscis’ proximal
half (Figs 39g, i, j, l, m, 40a–d, g–i, 41a, b, 42t, x, 43b1, c1, d, e1, f, h, w, 44a, b, d, f, k, 45a, c, d). Vacuoles
connected with an extensive system of branching and anastomosing canals (Figs 40l, o) described in detail
by FaBre-Domergue (1891). Invariably one intrakinetal pore per vacuole according to hamBurger (1903;
Figs 41n, o), kahl (1931; Fig. 43e2), song & wilBert (1989; Figs 44n, o, s), and Foissner (1997a; Figs
44w, y), while three pores one after the other according to Bütschli (1876), indicating that his population
might be a distinct taxon.
Extrusomes in vivo rod-shaped, forming several rows in proboscis oral bulge (Figs 43e3, e4, 44h). kahl
(1931), additionally, figured a ring of extrusomes (cortical granules?) in the oral bulge opening (Fig.
43e3), but did not mention this in the description. After protargol impregnation about 3 µm long and rod-
shaped, when exploded of typical toxicyst structure (Fig. 44l). Should be studied in further populations
and in more detail.
Cortex flexible, about 2 μm thick, slightly furrowed by ciliary rows in SEM micrographs (Figs 41p, 43c2,
e2, 45s). Several rows of rather loosely spaced cortical granules between each two kineties (Fig. 44m);
individual granules resemble oral bulge extrusomes in protargol preparations but are shorter; exploded
granules form a filamentous cover, showing their mucocyst nature (Fig. 43g). Mitochondria underneath
cortex, globular to ellipsoidal (Fig. 41p). Silverline pattern narrowly meshed, meshes polygonal and
about 0.5 μm in size, not yet studied in detail (Figs 43q, 44j, p). Cytoplasm colourless, usually strongly
vacuolated; large vacuoles surrounded by cytoplasmic strands forming a rough network; packed with 1–4
μm-sized granules, rod-like bacteria, and two to several large food vacuoles usually containing peritrich
ciliates; sometimes an accumulation of small lipid droplets or defecation vacuoles in posterior pole area
(Figs 41d–f, h, m, q, s, 42t, u3, v, x, 44r, u, 45a–e). Reliable observations on movement lacking.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, shrunken to 4–5.5 μm in SEM; in protargol preparations as typical for
dileptids, i.e., with thick, strongly impregnated distal half; narrowly to ordinarily spaced. Ciliary rows
narrowly and equidistantly spaced, meridionally arranged, gradually shortened right and left of oral bulge;
number studied only in German populations: 86–109 according to song & wilBert (1989) and 90–120
according to Foissner (1997a). Right side ciliary rows abut on perioral kinety at obtuse angles (~ 140°; Figs
44t, w), not almost rectangularly as figured by Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis (Fig. 44i). First row right
of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety with narrowly spaced cilia to tip of proboscis (Figs 44i, o,
s, t, v, w, 45m). Left side ciliary rows abut on preoral kineties at almost right to obtuse angles (Fig. 44i,
o, s, v). Anterior end of ventral ciliary rows more densely ciliated and slightly curved rightwards abutting
on circumoral kinety (Figs 44i, o, s, v, w). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of
119

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
three to four rows commencing apically (row 4, if present, inconspicuous, composed of alternating mono-
and dikinetids); distinctly heterostichad because middle row shorter by about 45% than longest row 3 (Fig.
44y), isostichad according to song & wilBert (Fig. 44n); heteromorphic especially in posterior third, that
is, contains dikinetids with a bristle and an ordinary cilium and/or monokinetids with ordinary cilia; some
kineties abut on left side of brush, forming an inconspicuous suture (Fig. 44y, arrowheads); proboscis
brush bristles very soft and closely spaced, thus appearing as a single, rather conspicuous structure (kahl
1931). Brush dikinetids associated with type III bristles gradually shortening from about 3.5 μm anteriorly
to 2 μm posteriorly in SEM (Fig. 45r). According to kahl (1931), all brush rows continue with a bristle
tail reaching rear body end (Fig. 43e1), while our SEM data, based on two populations, show that only row
3 has a tail of 1.7 μm long, monokinetidal bristles extending to third fourth of body (Figs 45p, s).
Oral bulge opening usually at end of anterior body third, does not project; dileptid, i.e., circular both
in vivo and in preparations, about 10 μm across in SEM (Figs 40n, 41c, 42a, s, 43e3, 44i, o, v, 45i, n,
q). Oral bulge and bulge opening indistinct in SEM micrographs because rather flat and more or less
covered by the oral ciliature (Figs 45n, q). Pharyngeal basket embedded in viscous cytoplasm in vivo,
obliquely directed to cell centre; internal basket clavate and composed of innumerable fibres, conspicuous
in vivo and protargol preparations; external basket comparatively inconspicuous, impregnates only in
distal portion (Figs 40m, 42a, b, 42u2, 43c4, 44s, u–w, 45j, m). Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly
spaced dikinetids throughout, those in proboscis associated with fibres extending posteriorly to form a
loose funnel (Figs 44i, o, s, v–w, 45i, j). About 50 oblique to slightly oblique, ordinarily spaced preoral
kineties, as estimated from figures, each composed of two to four, usually three narrowly spaced cilia
(Figs 44i, o, s, v, 45j).
Encystment and resting cyst (Figs 40j, k): FaBre-Domergue (1891) observed encystment and early
resting cysts. His data can be summarized as follows: (i) during the initial stages, the proboscis is put on
the ventral side of the body; (ii) the body diminishes by about one half and becomes a more or less perfect
sphere; (iii) the cytoplasm loses the strongly vacuolated appearance and becomes homogenous; (iv) the
contractile vacuoles disappear except for one terminal vacuole surrounded by several small vacuoles; (iv)
the resting cysts are about 150 μm across and have a smooth, about 5 μm thick wall.
Notes on division (Figs 41i, 42d, i–m): Body and nuclear division were studied by hamBurger (1903).
Basically, the processes are similar to those of other dileptids, but have been not yet studied with modern
methods: (i) cell division occurs in active (non-encysted) condition (but see nusch 1975 below); (ii) the
parental oral apparatus remains unchanged; (iii) slightly before separation, the daughter cells are connected
with the posterior end of the proter and the developing oral bulge opening of the opisthe; (iv) the proboscis
appears in mid-dividers as a small convexity in the opisthe’s dorsal area and matures post-divisionally;
and (v) the macronucleus is homomeric and becomes rod-like in mid-dividers. Two peculiarities occur: (i)
the division furrow sections the fossa into two equal parts (Figs 42i, j) and (ii) slightly before separation,
the opisthe rotates about the dorsoventral axis, causing the proter’s and opisthe’s main body axis to form
a right angle (Fig. 42l).
Notes on conjugation (Figs 39h, 41k): Conjugation occurs very rarely in Trachelius ovum, as only two
records are available, showing, however, different conjugation modes: homopolar according to Bütschli
(1889), while heteropolar according to hamBurger (1903). The latter mode is more likely because it has
been observed also in other dileptids. hamBurger (1903) provided the following data: (i) partners unite
bulge-to-bulge; (ii) in each partner, there is a small vacuole enclosing two globular macronuclear nodules
and a large empty vacuole; (iii) oral bulge opening, oral basket and lateral fossa not recognizable during
conjugation (Fig. 41k).

Notes on regeneration (Figs 42n–r): hamBurger (1903) made four experiments on regeneration of T.
ovum. (i) After longitudinal section (Fig. 42n), the ventral part of the cell remained straight and rotated
slowly about the main axis, while the dorsal part of the cell rotated very quickly about the section centre
enclosing the wound (Fig. 42o); both parts of the cell regenerated in about twelve hours. (ii) After transverse
section (Fig. 42p), the anterior part of the cell, very likely without macronucleus, died in one day, while
the posterior part containing the macronucleus regenerated in about five hours. (iii) When the cell was
sectioned into three parts each having at least a small portion of the macronucleus (Fig. 42q), all pieces
survived and regenerated. (iv) When cells were sectioned as shown in Fig. 42r, the pieces containing part
of the macronucleus regenerated, while those without macronucleus died in a few hours.
Occurrence and ecology (mainly from Foissner et al. 1995): Trachelius ovum occurs worldwide in the
periphyton, benthos, and plankton of mesosaprobic running and stagnant waters with peak abundances
during the cold half of the year (zimmer 1898, kalmus 1928, nusch 1970, Bick & kunze 1971, heuss
1976, alBrecht 1984; Fig. 45v). The upper temperature limit is 25 °C according to Bick & Bertram (1973)
and 28 °C according to Bernerth (1982; Fig. 45t). Trachelius ovum usually feeds on colonial peritrichs,
especially Carchesium polypinum (nusch 1970, Bernerth 1982). nusch (1975) observed one Trachelius

ovum engulfing ten Carchesium-zooids one after the other, prior to rounding off and forming a digestive
or division cyst. Further peritrichs serving as food: Astylozoon fallax, Epistylis hentscheli, and Vorticella
campanula (hammann 1952, stössel 1979, rieDel-lorJé 1981, reck 1987, schneiDer 1988, canter et
al. 1992). Small algae, flagellates, various ciliates, and large (up to 500 μm) rotifers, such as Asplanchna
priodonta, were also ingested (kaltenBach 1962; Bick 1972a, 1972b; czaPik 1975; hollowDay 1979).
schönBorn (1982) observed that the Trachelius ovum-population of a middle-sized river consumed
246 000 mg/m2 of nutrients per year, i.e., had a daily uptake of 240 flagellates and Vorticella cells with
a total volume of 16 × 106 μm3. P:N-ratio of excretion products about 1:5 (Bownik-Dylinska 1981).
alBrecht (1984) classified Trachelius ovum as an oligo- to meso-stenohaline species on basis of literature
data and his investigations of oversalted (up to 0.4%) rivers in Germany. This is supported by recent
records from the Baltic Sea (telesh et al. 2008). schönBorn (1982) calculated the following production
data for a population from the alpha-mesosaprobic Saale River in Germany: generation time 120–336 h,
average abundance 2 ind./cm2, productivity 142 ind./cm2/a, P/B = 71. Biomass of 106 specimens: 1572
mg (nesterenko & koValchuk 1991), 851 mg (schönBorn 1982), about 3000 mg when an average size
of 300 × 200 μm is assumed (Foissner et al. 1995). Prefered average O -concentrations of 6–8 mg/l (Fig.
2
45u) and a pH range of 5.3–8.4 (nieDerlehner & cairns 1990). stössel (1979) found T. ovum in Swiss
rivers at 4–24 °C and preferentially at 2.6–3.6 mg/l DOC (total range 0.4–7.2 mg/l); Bernerth (1982)
found a range of 6–18.4 mg/l DOC. Further abiotic parameters, see Table 23.
Records from running waters: in mud of a cave brook in Germany (griePenBurg 1933, see also gittleson
& hooVer 1969); in summer plankton of the Rhine River, Germany (noll 1972); in plankton of the
Elbe River, in mud from the sewage-water area in the surroundings of the town of Hamburg, and in
the periphyton and benthos of the mesosaprobic Hamburg harbour, and in the Isebekkanal in Hamburg,
Germany (roy 1938; casPers & schulz 1960, 1964; tent 1981; Bartsch & hartwig 1984; krieg 2000);
numerous in the stygorhitral (10 cm) of the Fulda River, Germany (lüPkes 1976); in the periphyton of
an oligo- to beta-mesosaprobic brook close to the town of Bonn, Germany (Jutrczenki 1982); in the
periphyton of alpha-mesosaprobic and alphameso- to polysaprobic running waters in Germany and the
former Yugoslavia (Primc 1981, 1984; Bauer 1987); sometimes numerous in beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic
brooks and rivers in Upper Austria and Bavaria, Germany (AOÖLR 1992, 1993a, 1994; Foissner & moog
1992; Foissner et al. 1992a, b, 1995); in the periphyton and sediment of a clean foothill stream in Germany
(PackroFF & zwick 1996); beta-mesosaprobic rivers in the former Czechoslovakia (Šrámek-huŠek 1956a,
1957; szentiVány & tirJakoVá 1994; tirJakoVá 1998, 2003; Baláži & matis 2002); in summer up to 60
ind./l in the free water and in the periphyton of the mesosaprobic Danube River in Hungary (Bereczky
1975, 1977a; Bereczky et al. 1983); Danube River (enăceanu & Brezeanu 1970); in several freshwaters
of Bulgaria (DetcheVa 1992); in alphameso- to polysaprobic parts of Polish rivers (czaPik 1982; hul 1986,
1987); in autumn in the River Lielupe, Latvia (liePa 1973); in the plankton of the Pripyat River, Ukraine
(neBrat 1992); in Ukrainian brooks and rivers (kraVchenko 1969, koValchuk 1997a); rare and with low
abundance in the shallow water zone of the Volga River during spring (mamaeVa 1979c); occassionally
abundant in a polluted river in Delhi, India (kaur & mehra 2001); in a soft-water river in east of the USA
(Patrick 1961); in July in the benthos of a slightly to moderately polluted (3.5–10.3 mg/l BSB ) American
5
river (cairns & yongue 1973); in the fine-grained sand of an African river (Dragesco 1972b, Dragesco
& Dragesco-kernéis 1986).

Records from brackish or sea waters are possibly misidentifications (Boutchinsky 1895, leVanDer 1901,
VerschaFFelt 1930, ruggiu 1965, lóPez-ochoterena et al. 1976, alaDro-luBel et al. 1990, santagelo
& lucchesi 1992, wilBert 1995). Most of them could have been Apotrachelius multinucleatus, while the
populations of lóPez-ochoterena et al. (1976) and alaDro-luBel et al. (1990), which have an ellipsoidal
macronucleus and only one contractile vacuole in posterior body end, could be a distinct species.
Saprobic classification: sláDeček et al. (1981), wegl (1983), and Foissner (1988a) classified Trachelius
ovum as a beta-mesosaprobic ciliate with the following valencies: o = 1, b = 7, a = 2, I = 3, SI = 2.1.
FrieDrich (1990): beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic; b = 5, b–a = 10, a = 5, I = 8, SI = 2.5. Buck (1971): most
frequent at a saprobity index of 2.54 ± 0.29. stössel (1979) questioned the indicative value of T. ovum
because it is strongly associated with peritrich ciliates, the preferred food. Literature research showed,
indeed, a very broad range of occurrence with preference of mesosaprobic areas. Therefore, Foissner et
al. (1995) allocated the valencies as follows: alpha- to beta-mesosaprobic; o = 1, b = 4, a = 4, p = 1, I = 1,
SI = 2.5. Usually indicates an abundance of peritrich ciliates.
Apotrachelius Vďačný, al-rashEid & FoissnEr nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small- to medium-sized Tracheliidae with broad body. Many scattered macronuclear nodules.
Oral bulge extrusomes lacking. Oral bulge opening paradileptid.
Type species: Apotrachelius multinucleatus nov. sp.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the generic name Trachelius, referring
to the Trachelius-like general organization. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Apotrachelius is related to Trachelius as evident from the following combination of features: (i)
broadly dileptid body with a lateral fossa; (ii) ciliary rows gradually shortened right and left of oral bulge,
and thus not producing a blank stripe; (iii) dorsal brush not staggered; (iv) circumoral kinety dikinetidal
throughout; and (v) internal oral basket clavate. However, Apotrachelius differs not only from Trachelius
but from all other dileptids in having lost the oral extrusomes, a main character of free-living litostomateans
(corliss 1979, lynn 2008). This negative feature has been found and used, inter alia, as a generic character
in two fuscheriid genera, viz., Coriplites and Apocoriplites (Foissner 1988b, oertel et al. 2008), and
as a species character in several spathidiids, for instance, Arcuospathidium cooperi, A. vermiforme, and
Apertospathula inermis (Foissner & Xu 2007). A further curious feature of Apotrachelius is the laterally
located oral bulge opening, a trait characteristic for only one other dileptid genus, Paradileptus. However,
Paradileptus has two perioral kineties, staggered dorsal brush rows, a broad blank stripe left of the oral
bulge, and lacks a fossa. This indicates that the laterally located oral bulge opening of Apotrachelius
evolved convergently. Thus, the lack of extrusomes and the Paradileptus-like oral bulge opening justify
generic separation of Apotrachelius multinucleatus and Trachelius ovum. Additionally, Apotrachelius
multinucleatus does not have a single macronucleus, as Trachelius, but many scattered nodules, showing
that this feature also evolved two times.

Diagnosis: Size about 300 × 150 μm in vivo. Shape broadly dileptid with broadly rounded posterior
end, proboscis oral bulge about 1/4 of body length. Many scattered macronuclear nodules and several
globular micronuclei. Many scattered contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each. On average 209 ciliary rows,
4 anteriorly differentiated into a distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with monokinetidal tails extending
posteriorly. Oral bulge opening about 20 μm across. Preoral kineties oblique to strongly oblique, ordinarily
to widely spaced, each usually composed of 3 narrowly spaced cilia. In marine coastal waters.
Type locality: Brackish coastal pond at Safwa village, Saudi Arabian Gulf coast, E50°06’ N26°39’.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 195) and six paratype slides (inv. nos 196-201) with protargol-
impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz
(LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin numeral multi and the noun nucleus, referring to the many macronuclear
nodules, a main feature of the species.
Description of Saudi Arabian population: Size about 250–300 × 150 μm in vivo, while about 400 ×
250 μm in the protargol preparations due to a strong inflation with Wilbert’s method (Table 22); very
flexible but not contractile. Shape dileptid to broadly dileptid both in vivo and in preparations, that is,
length:width ratio 3:2–2.5:1; body flattened about 2:1. Proboscis occupies one fifth to one third of body
length, usually one fourth; conical with anterior portion slightly curved dorsally. Trunk usually ovoidal to
globular, rarely oblong, left side convex, right flattened and with conspicuous, about 25 μm long fossa in
protargol preparations (Figs 46a, g, m–x, 47a–f, q, r, t). Nuclear apparatus in trunk and proximal proboscis
half. About 75–180 scattered macronuclear nodules; individual nodules highly variable, that is, globular
to strand-like and 5–62 × 4–10 μm in size, sometimes connected by fine bridges and thus very likely

granules narrowly spaced in somatic and oral bulge cortex, about 1.5 × 0.2 μm in vivo (0.9–1.2 μm long
in SEM); do not stain with methyl green-pyronin, but usually impregnate deeply with protargol making
observation of ciliary pattern difficult; when exploded form a spongious cover (Figs 46d, e, 47s, u, v).
Mitochondria underneath cortex, ellipsoidal and about 4 × 2 μm in size (Fig. 46d). Cytoplasm colourless
and hyaline because strongly vacuolated, except for posterior body portion appearing brown-black at low
magnification due to an accumulation of lipid droplets 1–5 μm across (Figs 46a, g, 47a). Feeds on small,
yellow-green cryptomonads, which are collected in food vacuoles up to 60 × 40 μm in size and usually
localized in centre of trunk. Swims moderately fast.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e.,
with thick, strongly impregnated distal half; arranged in an average of 209 longitudinal, narrowly spaced
rows gradually shortening right and left of oral bulge (Figs 46h, i, k, 47d–f, j, l; Table 22). First row
right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety with narrowly to ordinarily spaced cilia to tip of
proboscis, frequently with some irregularities, e.g., short breaks and/or connected to somatic ciliary rows
in posterior portion (Figs 46h, i, k, arrowheads; 47j, l). Ciliature condensed and curved towards fossa,
i.e., some somatic kineties end at fossa margin, while others extend to its bottom and proceed posteriorly
(Figs 46j, 47q, t). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of four heterostichad rows
commencing apically and continuing posteriorly with monokinetidal tails composed of 1–2 μm long, very
narrowly spaced type VI bristles (Figs 46l, 47o, p, r). Brush dikinetids associated with type II bristles
gradually shortening from about 5 μm (3.8 μm in SEM) anteriorly to 2 μm (1.8 μm in SEM) posteriorly;
posterior bristles of dikinetids shortened by about one fourth, their length decreases to 2 μm posteriorly.
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body fourth, does not project from body proper; Paradileptus-like,
that is, proximal portion curved leftwards, just as in numeral 6; about 20 μm across in vivo, while 35 μm
across after protargol impregnation due to strong body inflation (Figs 46a, f, k, m, n, 47e, f–h; Table 22).
Pharyngeal basket embedded in viscous cytoplasm in vivo, obliquely directed to cell centre; internal basket
clavate and composed of innumerable fibres about 50 μm long in protargol preparations; external basket
comparatively inconspicuous and impregnated only in distal portion (Figs 46c, f–h, k, 47m, n; Table 22).
Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids throughout, those of proboscis associated with
fibres extending posteriorly to form a loose funnel; right branch curves around anterior end of proboscis,
left branch ends subapically almost touching curved right end (Figs 46h, i, k, r, 47i, k, l). About 35 oblique
to strongly oblique, ordinarily to widely spaced preoral kineties associated with left branch of circumoral
kinety, some kineties convex and more or less distinctly connected with left side ciliary rows; individual
preoral kineties composed of two to six, usually of three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 46h, i, k, 47k).
Notes on North American population: Jones (1974) misidentified an Alabaman population as “Trachelius
tracheloides maskell, 1887” which is, however, a misidentified Ophryoglena, as already recognized by
kahl (1931). Certainly, Jones’ specimens (Fig. 46b) highly resemble Apotrachelius multinucleatus in
body shape and size (200 μm and 250–300 μm), the nuclear apparatus and, especially, the saline habitat.
However, the contractile vacuole pattern is different: Jones’ specimens have only one terminal vacuole,
while A. multinucleatus has many scattered vacuoles. Nevertheless, Jones (1974) did not figure the terminal
vacuole and possibly overlooked the small scattered vacuoles due to the strongly vacuolated cytoplasm. If
this is the case, conspecificity of the Alabaman and Saudi Arabian populations is very likely.
Occurrence and ecology: Apotrachelius multinucleatus was discovered in a large (about 200 × 200 m,
max. depth 4 m), brackish (~ 12–28‰) pool at Safwa village in the Al Qatif oasis, about 15 km north of
Dammam (Saudi Arabia) and about 2 km inshore from the Saudi Arabian Gulf coast. The pool, which was
surrounded by salt-tolerant tall reeds (Phragmites communis) and black mangrove (Avicennia marina), was
connected with the Gulf via the water table. Apotrachelius multinucleatus was collected at the margin of the
141

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
pool, where the muddy, sandy sediment is strongly rooted by the plants mentioned above. During the hot
season, when the water table decreases, the sediment becomes microaerobic or anaerobic. The contractile
vacuoles indicate that A. multinucleatus can live at very low salinities, possibly even in freshwater. Very
likely, A. multinucleatus occurs also at the South Korean sea coast (Dr. kwon, pers. comm.). Further, al-
rasheiD (1997, 1999) reported Trachelius ovum from the saline (18‰) Al-Hassa oasis. Possibly, this was
A. multinucleatus, although al-rasheiD (1997) mentioned “macronucleus in two parts”.
Remarks: Apotrachelius multinucleatus is easily recognizable in vivo due to the broadly dileptid body,
the small proboscis, the many macronuclear nodules, the scattered contractile vacuoles, and the lack of
oral extrusomes. This is fortunate because it is difficult to fix and to impregnate with protargol, making
morphometry and observations on the ciliary pattern difficult. There is only one species similar to A.
multinucleatus, viz., Trachelius ovum. However, A. multinucleatus is easily distinguished from T. ovum
by the many small macronuclear nodules (vs. one large nodule) and the absence (vs. presence) of oral
extrusomes, a feature checked very carefully with optimum technical equipment in several specimens.
Apotrachelius multinucleatus is also different from Trachelius gutta, originally a poorly described species
from saline habitats (for figures, see Trachelius ovum) now well redescibed and neotypified as Orthodonella
gutta by lin et al. (2004). They differ in body size (300 μm vs. 120 μm), the number of ciliary rows (209
vs. 50), and the contractile vacuole pattern (many scattered vacuoles vs. one or few terminal vacuoles).

(improved diagnosis)
Diagnosis: Body broadly to rod-like dileptid, rarely rostrate. Proboscis agile, its ventral and dorsal side
of similar length. Dorsal brush staggered and two- or multi-rowed. Circumoral kinety hybrid, i.e., oral
dikinetids in proboscis and monokinetids around oral bulge opening. Internal oral basket bulbous or
obconical.
Type family (by subsequent designation): Dileptidae Jankowski, 1980.
Etymology: Composite of the stem of the generic name Dileptus and the order suffix -ida.
Remarks: In 1975, Jankowski classified dileptids at ordinal rank as “Rhynchostomatida (Dileptida)” in
his conspectus of the system of Ciliophora. However, this name is unavailable because (i) unpublished
(appeared in an abstract) under Article 9.9 and (ii) without description and definition under Article 13.1 of
the ICZN (1999). Three years later, Jankowski (1978) established validly the order Dileptida and diagnosed
it briefly as follows: “holotrichous ciliates with agile proboscis and posteriorly located oral opening”.
Based on a very detailed cladistic study, Vďačný et al. (2011b) redefined the order, using especially details
142

of the somatic and oral ciliature. The monophyly of this order was fully supported by molecular data and
by two strong morphological synapomorphies: a hybrid circumoral kinety and a staggered dorsal brush
(Vďačný et al. 2011b). The order Dileptida comprises two families: the Dimacrocaryonidae with one or
two macronuclear nodules, and the Dileptidae with at least four macronuclear nodules.
Key to Families
1 Macronucleus unsegmented or in two nodules .................................... Dimacrocaryonidae (p. 143)
– Macronucleus in at least four moniliform or scattered nodules ......................... Dileptidae (p. 262)

2011 Dimacrocaryonidae fam. n. Vďačný, orsi, BourlanD, shimano, ePstein & Foissner, Eur. J. Protistol. 47: 310
Diagnosis: Dileptida with macronucleus in one or two nodules. Dorsal brush two-rowed, rarely multi-
rowed. Oral apparatus dileptid.
Type genus (by original designation): Dimacrocaryon Jankowski, 1967.
Remarks: The Dimacrocaryonidae unites four genera whose macronucleus is unsegmented
(Monomacrocaryon) or in two nodules (Dimacrocaryon, Rimaleptus, Microdileptus). This family is
monophyletic in molecular phylogenies, but it is paraphyletic in both the Hennigian argumentation scheme
and the computer-assisted cladograms (Vďačný et al. 2011b). This discrepancy is caused by the lack
of morphological synapomorphies for the genus Monomacrocaryon and the Dimacrocaryon-Rimaleptus
clade. However, the molecular data indicate that the unsegmented macronucleus of Monomacrocaryon
evolved from a binucleate state by fusion of the macronuclear nodules.
Dimacrocaryon, Rimaleptus, and Microdileptus share a combination of two distinct features not found
in any other dileptid genus: (i) two macronuclear nodules with a single micronucleus in between and
(ii) an usually two-rowed dorsal brush. Thus, we suppose that the three genera have a common ancestor.
Rimaleptus and Microdileptus maintained the ancestral oral apparatus, while Dimacrocaryon developed
several specialties.

Diagnosis: Small- to very large-sized Dimacrocaryonidae with narrow to cylindroidal body. Macronucleus
oblong to rod-shaped. Dorsal brush staggered and multi-rowed. Right branch of circumoral kinety
accompanied by a perioral kinety, left branch by many slightly to strongly oblique preoral kineties. Oral

bulge opening dileptid, i.e., roundish or ovate and located ventrally, length about 15 µm. Oral basket
bulbous or obconical.
Type species (by original designation): Dileptus terrenus Foissner, 1981.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek numeral mono (one), the adjective makros (large), and the noun
karyon (nucleus), referring to the unsegmented macronucleus. Neuter gender.
Remarks: Monomacrocaryon differs from all dileptids, except for Trachelius, by the unsegmented
macronucleus. Monomacrocaryon is distinguished from Trachelius by the narrow body without lateral
fossa (vs. broad with lateral fossa) and the oral ciliature (hybrid vs. dikinetidal circumoral kinety).
Beginners may confuse Monomacrocaryon with Rimaleptus, in which the two macronuclear nodules are
usually close together or sometimes abutting, thus appearing as a single, oblong structure.

Diagnosis: Length about 85 μm, contracts up to 50%. Shape narrowly to very narrowly dileptid with
acute posterior end, proboscis about 1/3 of body length. Macronucleus cylindroidal to rod-shaped, usually
curved or twisted. Two diagonally arranged dorsal contractile vacuoles. Extrusomes broadly fusiform and
short. Oral bulge opening roundish.
Type locality: Mosses from the surroundings of the town of Geneva, Switzerland, E6°08’ N46°12’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective tenuis (thin) obviously refers to body
shape.
Description: Length 60–110 μm, contracts up to 50%. Shape narrowly to very narrowly dileptid, that is,
length:width ratio 4–9.5:1, according to the figures provided. Proboscis motile, occupies about one third
of body length, not set off from trunk, thus providing cells with an Arcuospathidium or pleurostomatid
appearance; trunk unflattened, bluntly fusiform, pointed posteriorly (Figs 48a, b, d–f). Macronucleus
cylindroidal to rod-shaped with a length:width ratio of 10–15:1, usually twisted or curved. Two diagonally
arranged dorsal contractile vacuoles: anterior vacuole posterior to oral bulge opening, posterior one
subterminal and sometimes accompanied by a smaller vacuole (Figs 48a, b, e, f). Extrusomes attached to
proboscis oral bulge, short and bluntly fusiform as described and figured by PenarD (Fig. 48c); of typical
toxicyst structure when exploded. Number of ciliary rows not studied, but PenarD (1922) figured seven

rows on one side. Oral bulge opening roundish (Fig. 48b). Pharyngeal basket bulbous and short (Fig.
48c).
Occurrence and ecology: PenarD (1922) found Monomacrocaryon tenue exclusively in mosses from
old walls in the surroundings of the town of Geneva, Switzerland. Later records not substantiated by
illustrations: decaying wood mass from the Erlangen area in Bavaria, Germany (wenzel 1953); various
soils in Belgium (charDez 1967, 1987); bog pond in France (grolière & nJiné 1973); mosses from
various localities in Slovakia (rosa 1957; tirJakoVá & matis 1987, tirJakoVá 2005); and in a soil sample
from Abaco Island, Bahamas (cairns & ruthVen 1972).
Remarks: Within the congeners, M. tenue is outstanding in having (i) a highly contractile body (vs.
not contractile), (ii) only two dorsal contractile vacuoles (vs. at least five), and (iii) bluntly fusiform
extrusomes (vs. rather fine and rod-shaped or slightly ovate). There are only two other contractile dileptids,
viz., Pseudomonilicaryon dimorphum and Rimaleptus lacazei. However, Pseudomonilicaryon dimorphum
has four macronuclear nodules in series, and Rimaleptus lacazei has two globular, abutting nodules. As
mentioned by Dragesco (1963), Monomacrocaryon tenue is very similar to Pseudomonilicaryon anguillula
and P. gracile. However, both have a moniliform macronucleus and rod-shaped or very narrowly ovate
extrusomes. Additionally, P. anguillula differs from Monomacrocaryon tenue by the contractile vacuole
pattern (a dorsal row of vacuoles vs. two diagonal vacuoles).

Nomenclature: According to Articles 30.2.4, 31.2 and 34.2 of the ICZN (1999), we emend
Monomacrocaryon terrenus to M. terrenum nom. corr. because Monomacrocaryon is neuter gender.
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 370 × 45 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
to very narrowly dileptid with gradually narrowed posterior region, proboscis about 37% of body length.
Macronucleus cylindroidal and often curved, accompanied by a single micronucleus. A dorsal stripe of
contractile vacuoles with usually two pores each. Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral
bulge: type I rod-shaped to slightly ovate, 4–8 μm long; type II oblong, 1.5–3 μm long. On average 28
ciliary rows, up to 7 anteriorly differentiated to a staggered, distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with
monokinetidal tails extending to second third of body. Oral bulge opening about 15 μm across. On average
47 oblique, widely spaced preoral kineties, each composed of 2–3 narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Floodplain soil from a meadow in the vicinity of the village of Fusch an der Glocknerstrasse,
Central Alps (Grossglockner area), Austria, E12°49’ N47°13’.
Type and voucher material: Deposition of type material not mentioned in the original paper (Foissner
1981). One voucher slide (inv. no. 1984/72; mislabelled as “paratype”) with protargol-impregnated
specimens described by Foissner (1984) has been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper
Austria, Linz (LI). Vďačný & Foissner (2009) have deposited four voucher slides (inv. nos 2011/319–322)
with Peruvian (Titicaca Lake) protargol-impregnated morphostatic and dividing specimens in the same
repository. Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Gene sequence: The 18S rRNA gene sequence of an Upper Austrian population (Figs 49d, 50a–w) has
been deposited in GenBank (HM581674). The sequence is 1639 nucleotides long and has a GC content of
42.5%. It is a consensus sequence based on 18 clones.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective terrenus (living in soil) obviously refers
to the habitat in which the species was discovered.
Description: Size in vivo highly variable in various populations, i.e., 180–560 × 35–65 µm, usually about
370 × 45 μm: Austrian type specimens 400–450 × 40–50 μm (Foissner 1981), Mongolian cells 530–
560 μm long (tirJakoVá & matis 1985). Size after protargol impregnation: Austrian voucher specimens
152–350 × 32–56 μm (Foissner 1984), Peruvian cells 226–315 × 34–56 μm (Vďačný & Foissner 2009).
Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape narrowly to very narrowly dileptid, i.e., length:width ratio
2.7–8.1:1 after protargol impregnation (Table 24). Proboscis about 37% of body length, usually curved
dorsally; trunk bluntly fusiform with gradually narrowed posterior third, in a single Mongolian specimen
posterior end abruptly narrowed (Figs 49a, b, i, j, 50a, j–l). Nuclear apparatus in mid-portion of trunk.
Macronucleus oblong to rod-shaped, often curved or slightly tortuous, sometimes Y-shaped in Peruvian
specimens (Fig. 49o), about 80 μm long in “uncoiled” condition; nucleoli medium-sized, globular.
Micronucleus usually attached to mid-macronucleus, size similar between populations, viz., 2–4 μm across
(Figs 49a, b, i, o, 50a, b; Table 24). A stripe of dorsal contractile vacuoles, first vacuole in mid-proboscis;
number of excretory pores per vacuole rather variable even in a single cell, viz., one to three, usually two
intrakinetal pores one after the other (Figs 49a, i, o, 50b, l, s, w). Two types of extrusomes attached to
right broader branch of proboscis oral bulge: type I rod-shaped with rounded ends, 8 μm long in Austrian
type specimens, 5–8 × 0.8 μm in size in Namibian cells, and 4 μm long in Peruvian specimens (Figs 49g,
50c, d), while slightly ovate and asymmetrical in populations from the Galapagos Islands (6–7 × 0.4–0.6
μm), Namibia (5–7 × 0.5–0.8 μm, another population than that mentioned above), and North America (6 ×
0.8 μm, Fig. 50h); type II extrusomes oblong, 1.5–3 × 0.3–0.5 μm in size (Figs 49g, h, 50e). Cortex very
flexible, slightly furrowed by ciliary rows; between each two kineties about three rows of oblong granules
possibly contained in the interkinetal, oblique ridges sometimes distinct in SEM micrographs (Figs 49f,
50j, k). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in proboscis, opaque in trunk because packed with globules about 3

μm across and several 20 μm-sized food vacuoles with indeterminable contents. Swims slowly and roots
between soil particles.
Cilia about 12 μm long in vivo, shrunken to 6 μm in SEM, narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations
as typical for dileptids, i.e., with thick, deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles. Ciliary
rows ordinarily spaced, number fairly similar between populations: 26–33 in Austrian type specimens,
26–27 in voucher Austrian specimens, and 24–31 in Peruvian cells (Table 24). Right side ciliary rows
gradually shortened in anterior half of proboscis; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with ordinarily
to narrowly spaced basal bodies (Figs 49m, o, 50t). Left side of proboscis with conspicuous blank stripe
because most ciliary rows end at level of oral bulge opening (Figs 49c, e, l, 50l, o, s, w). Dorsal brush on
dorsal and dorsolateral region of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; composed of up to seven
rows of loosely spaced dikinetids associated with type II bristles: anterior bristle of dikinetids 1.3–1.8 μm
long, posterior bristle 0.6–0.8 μm long in SEM (Figs 49l, n, 50l, o, v, w). All brush rows continue with a
monokinetidal tail extending to base of proboscis with 0.8 μm long type VI bristles (Figs 49l, s, v, w).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, projects distinctly, circular when viewed frontally
(Figs 49e, 50m, p), while ovate when viewed obliquely (Figs 50n, q), about 10–13 μm across in SEM.
Pharyngeal basket obconical, about 23 μm long after protargol impregnation in type specimens, without
specific features (Figs 49b, c, e, l, m, o). Foissner (1984), additionally, figured fibres originating from the
proboscis dikinetids and extending posteriorly to form a loose funnel (Figs 49l, m). Oral bulge distinct
in SEM micrographs due to nice metachronal ciliary waves formed by perioral and circumoral cilia on
the right (Figs 50j, r) and by preoral and circumoral cilia on the left (Figs 50k, r); right branch much
broader than left and dotted by extrusome tips (Figs 50n, r, u). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily
to narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening
(Figs 49c, e). On average 47 oblique, widely spaced preoral kineties extending in distinct furrows, each
kinety composed of two to three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 49c, e, k, l, 50k, o, w).
Resting cyst (Figs 49d, 50f–i; Table 24): All Upper Austrian specimens encysted when transferred from
the non-flooded Petri dish culture onto a microscope slide with a concave depression containing Eau
de Volvic. Three day-old resting cysts 60 μm across in vivo; globular to rotund, i.e., length:width ratio
1–1.2:1; honey brown; without escape apparatus. Cyst wall made of two distinct layers: external layer
7–13 μm thick, hyaline and colourless, with an extra membrane in half of cysts and with an accumulation
of granular, mucous material in one third of cysts (Figs 49d, 50g, arrowhead); internal layer 1.2 μm thick,
becoming 2 μm thick when cyst is pressed by the coverslip, honey brown, compact. Cyst wall covered by
an up to 10 μm thick, hyaline, colourless mucous layer. Cytoplasm packed with 0.7–1 μm-sized granules
becoming more or less regularly arranged underneath cortex. Macronucleus in cyst centre, curved or
slightly tortuous, about 55 μm long when uncoiled, and thus shorter than in vegetative specimens by about
one third. Extrusomes, contractile vacuoles, cilia, and the oral basket not recognizable.
Occurrence and ecology: Monomacrocaryon terrenum was discovered by Foissner (1981) in floodplain
soil from a pasture meadow in the vicinity of the village of Fusch an der Glocknerstrasse, Austrian Central
Alps, about 880 m above sea level. A voucher population was found in soil from the Tullnerfeld, Lower
Austria (Foissner 1984). Another voucher population came from soil in the outskirts of the town of Selker,
Upper Austria (Figs 49d, 50a–w; Vďačný et al. 2011b). There are several records from terrestrial and semi-
terrestrial habitats all over the world: in agricultural soils and in terrestrial mosses from Slovakia (tirJakoVá
1988, 2005); in soil from Apsheron Peninsula, Azerbaijan (alekPeroV & musayeV 1988); in the upper 0–5
cm soil layer covered with semi-desert vegetation, Bulgansomon, Mongolia (tirJakoVá & matis 1985); in
seven out of 73 sites investigated in Namibia, Southwest Africa (Foissner et al. 2002); in an up to 10 cm
thick accumulation of washed-up plant debris, including filamentous algae, macrophytes, duckweeds, and
153

some soil at the bank of the Titicaca Lake near the town of Puno, Peru (Vďačný & Foissner 2009); in soil
from the Galapagos Islands and North America (unpublished observations). Monomacrocaryon terrenum
is possibly a cosmopolitan restricted to terrestrial and semiterrestrial habitats.
Remarks: Monomacrocaryon terrenum is easily distinguished from the congeners by the dorsal stripe
of at least five contractile vacuoles, whereas M. tenue has only two vacuoles, and M. gigas and M.
polyvacuolatum possess also ventral vacuoles.
After the description of Foissner (1981), this species has been studied in populations from different
biogeographic regions (Foissner 1984, tirJakoVá & matis 1985, Vďačný & Foissner 2009, and unpublished
observations). All are similar in body shape and size as well as the nuclear and contractile vacuole pattern.
However, they differ in extrusome shape (see above), indicating two different taxa.

Generic affiliation, nomenclature, and taxonomy: Monomacrocaryon gigas was originally described as
Amphileptus gigas by claParèDe & lachmann (1859). kahl (1931) combined it with Dileptus due to the
dileptid habitus but erroneously classified Amphileptus as a subgenus of Dileptus. Vďačný et al. (2011b)
assigned it to Monomacrocaryon because of the unsegmented macronucleus.
Misspelled as “D. gigus” by stehle (1923) and “D. gygas” by alieV (1988), and thus unavailable according
to Articles 33.3 and 33.5 of the ICZN (1999).
Several authors erroneously considered D margaritifer as a synonym of Monomacrocaryon gigas (see

synonymy list). However, Dileptus margaritifer has a much smaller (usually 450 μm vs. 1000–1600 μm),
untwisted body; many scattered macronuclear nodules (vs. sigmoidal macronucleus); and only dorsal
contractile vacuoles (vs. ventral and dorsal ones). wrześniowski (1870) misidentified D anser (now
Pseudomonilicaryon anser) as Monomacrocaryon gigas. However, Pseudomonilicaryon anser is much
smaller (250–600 μm vs. 1000–1600 μm) and has a much longer proboscis (1/2 vs. 1/5 of body length) and

a moniliform macronucleus. stokes (1888) suggested Phragelliorhynchus nasutus as a junior synonym
of Monomacrocaryon gigas; kahl (1931) and Dragesco (1963) followed. However, we disagree because
Ph. nasutus is much smaller (200 μm vs. 1000–1500 μm) and has at least a dozen macronuclear nodules
(vs. unsegmented macronucleus).
Monomacrocaryon gigas should be easy to identify because it is the largest dileptid known being up to 1.6
mm long! In spite of this and several unique traits (twisted body, a dorsal papilla at the tip of the proboscis,
and a sigmoidal macronucleus), M. gigas has been never redescribed. There is only one other species
with twisted body, viz., Dileptus spiralis, which is much smaller (300 μm vs. 1.6 mm) and whose body
spiralization was possibly caused by mercuric chloride fixation. Full redescription is required.
Diagnosis (type population): Length about 1300 μm in vivo. Body twisted and very narrowly dileptid with
distinct tail, proboscis about 1/5 of body length and with a papilla at tip. Macronucleus sigmoidal. Many
scattered contractile vacuoles in trunk and proboscis.
Type locality: Freshwater in Berlin, Germany, E13°24’ N52°31’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. We consider the Greek gigas (giant) as a noun in apposition,
obviously referring to the large size of the species.
Description of type population: Length 1000–1600 μm in vivo; very flexible but not contractile. Body
twisted and very narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of about 8:1, according to the figure provided.
Proboscis occupies one fifth of body length, with a dorsal papilla at the tip, slightly flattened, indistinctly
set off from massive, fusiform trunk; tail distinct. Macronucleus sigmoidal with a length:width ratio of
about 7.5:1, both ends slightly inflated. At least 50 contractile vacuoles scattered in trunk and dorsal side of
proboscis (Figs 51b–d). Extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge, according to the original description
similar to the trichocysts of Paramecium aurelia, i.e., bluntly fusiform, but figured as slightly curved rods
(Fig. 51a). Pharyngeal basket obconical, conspicuous because long and composed of comparatively thick
rods. Ciliature not studied. Swims majestically folding the trunk or glides slowly between algae.
Division: This was studied by ruDin (1937) in clonal cultures but the identity of this species is questionable.
Depending on temperature, there were 0.3 to 1.4 divisions per day.
Occurrence and ecology: claParèDe & lachmann (1859) discovered Monomacrocaryon gigas in
freshwater from Berlin, Germany. There are rather many unsubstantiated records, which we doubt because
we never met this species. This is, for instance, obvious from several illustrations (Figs 51e–j) and the
description of holmes (1907): “Dileptus gigas commonly adheres to the surface of some solid object
and waves its long proboscis-like anterior extremity or neck about in an anti-clockwise direction” (cp.
Pseudomonilicaryon anser and P. fraterculum).
Records from limnetic habitats: in the aerobic sediment of a eutrophic lake in England (weBB 1961);

in a bog pond of France (grolière & nJiné 1973); ponds in the surroundings of the town of Neuchâtel,
Switzerland (Bourquin-linDt 1919) and other Swiss localities (BalDensPerger 1927); rare in the Lugana
Lake in Switzerland (Fehlmann 1912); possibly in the surroundings of the town of Munich, Germany
(PoPoff 1908; very likely this is D. margaritifer because it has hundreds macronuclear nodules and a body
size of 500–1000 µm); Italy (Dini et al. 1995); reported also in the databank of the Czech and Slovak
Fauna (Šrámek-huŠek 1952, matis et al. 1996); town of Budapest, Hungary (krePuska 1917); Danube

small pools with abundant decomposing organic sediment, USA (hausman 1917; misidentification, very
likely it is P. anser, Fig. 51h); pond in the Mountain Lake region, Virginia, USA (BoVee 1960); common
in ponds of Kansas, USA (smith 1914; likely a misidentification because it has a much longer proboscis
as shown in Fig. 51e); pond on shore of Lake Erie, Ohio, USA (stehle 1923; misspelled as D. gigus);

Jersey, USA (Fellers & allison 1920); New South Wales, Australia and South Africa (sanDon 1927, as
Amphileptus gigas).
Saprobic classification: Foissner (1988a) classified M. gigas as a beta-mesosaprobic ciliate with the
following valencies: b = 7, a = 3, I = 4, SI = 2.3.

Taxonomy: Within the congeners, M. polyvacuolatum resembles only M. terrenum, which has, however,
only dorsal contractile vacuoles (vs. also ventral ones). Bhatia (1936) described a population which
resembles M. polyvacuolatum in body size (200–400 μm, respectively, 200–500 μm), the proportion of
proboscis to body length (about 40%), and the contractile vacuole pattern (a dorsal and a ventral stripe of
vacuoles). However, this population, which was found in a river from Punjab (Lahore, Pakistan), has a
much longer, filiform, tortuous macronucleus (Fig. 52i). Bhatia (1936) identified the Pakistani population
as Dileptus anser. However, this species has a moniliform macronucleus, a longer proboscis (55% vs.
40% of body length) and lacks ventral vacuoles. Possibly, Bhatia’s population represents a distinct
species. stella (1948) found a population, which she also misidentified as D. anser, in forest soil from
Italy. stella’s population matches Monomacrocaryon polyvacuolatum in body size (300 µm on average)
and the contractile vacuole pattern, but differs in having a shorter proboscis and a much longer, filiform,
tortuous macronucleus (Fig. 52j). Thus, her species is possibly also a distinct taxon. Therefore, neither
Bhatia’s nor stella’s observations are included in the diagnosis and description of M. polyvacuolatum.

Improved diagnosis (excludes data from Bhatia 1936 and stella 1948): Size about 300 × 45 μm in
vivo. Shape narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with distinct tail or acute posterior end, proboscis about
40% of body length. Macronucleus oblong to cylindroidal and often curved. A dorsal and a ventral stripe
of contractile vacuoles. Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge: type I rod-shaped or
slightly ovate, 4–8 μm long; type II oblong, 2–3 μm long. On average 28 ciliary rows; dorsal brush diffuse,
staggered, all rows with a monokinetidal tail extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening about 15
μm across. Preoral kineties oblique, ordinarily to widely spaced, each usually composed of 3 narrowly
spaced cilia.
Type locality: Soil from a rice field about 30 km east of the town of Kumamoto, Japan, E130°41’
N32°47’.
Type material: Foissner (1989) deposited one holotype slide (inv. no. 1988/96) and one paratype slide
(inv. no. 1988/97) with protargol-impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper
Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Greek prefix poly (many) and the Latin
noun vacuola (vacuole), referring to the many contractile vacuoles.
Description: After the original description, we studied this species in several populations from different
biogeographic regions (unpublished observations). They were similar in body shape and size as well

as the nuclear and contractile vacuole pattern. However, they differed in extrusome shape (rod-like in
Japanese, African, Maldivian and Venezuelan populations vs. slightly ovate in Saudi Arabian and Austrian
populations) and arrangement (in broader right branch of Saudi Arabian and Austrian cells, while in both
bulge branches of Japanese specimens which, however, might be a misobservation). Redescription with
detailed morphometry and SEM observations (dorsal brush) recommended.
Size 200–500 × 30–60 μm in vivo, usually about 300 × 45 μm; very flexible but not contractile. Shape
narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid, i.e., length:width ratio 3.9–9.5:1 after protargol impregnation (Table
25). Proboscis about 40% of body length, slightly flattened, usually curved dorsally, indistinctly set off
from bluntly fusiform trunk; posterior end with distinct tail in Japanese type specimens, while acute in
Austrian cells (Figs 52g, h, p, q). Macronucleus oblong to cylindroidal and often curved, in Maldivian
specimens sometimes slightly constricted in mid, about 65 × 10 μm in size; nucleoli medium-sized,
globular. Micronucleus attached to macronucleus at various positions, about 3 μm across in vivo (Figs
52g, h, n, r; Table 25). A stripe of contractile vacuoles each in ventral and dorsal side of cell, first dorsal
vacuole in mid-proboscis, ventral stripe commences slightly posterior to oral bulge opening (Figs 52g,
p–r). Two types of extrusomes attached to both proboscis oral bulge branches in Japanese type specimens
(Fig. 52a; but see above), while only to broader right branch in Saudi Arabian and Austrian cells (Figs
52m, s): type I rod-shaped with rounded ends and slightly curved, 5 μm long in Japanese type specimens,
4–6 × 0.4 μm in African cells, 5–6 × 0.6 μm in Maldivian specimens, and 6–8 × 0.7 μm in Venezuelan
individuals (Figs 52b, d), while slightly ovate and 6–7 × 0.6 μm in Saudi Arabian and Austrian specimens
(Figs 52e, t); becomes bluntly fusiform before explosion in African specimens (Fig. 52f); type II oblong
and 2–3 × 0.2–0.3 μm in size (Figs 52d, e). Cortex very flexible, contains about six granule rows between
adjacent kineties (Figs 52c). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in proboscis, opaque in trunk because packed
with many granules about 1 μm across and some food vacuoles containing heterotrophic flagellates
(Polytomella). Glides moderately rapid on microscope slide.

Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids; arranged
in about 28 ordinarily spaced, meridional rows (Table 25). Right side rows gradually shortened in anterior
third of proboscis; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with ordinarily to narrowly spaced basal
bodies (Figs 52h, k). Left side of proboscis with rather broad blank stripe because most ciliary rows end
at level of oral bulge opening (Fig. 52l). Dorsal brush on dorsal and dorsolateral region of proboscis;
staggered; diffuse and very likely composed of four rows. Brush dikinetids very loosely spaced and
associated with three types of bristles: type II bristles about 2 µm long and in anterior portion of rows,
followed by some dikinetids with type III bristles and 1 µm long type VI monokinetidal tail bristles (Figs
52l, o; Table 25).
Oral bulge opening roundish, i.e., about 15 μm across in protargol preparations (Figs 52a, h; Table 25).
Pharyngeal basket obconical, without specific features (Figs 52g, h). Circumoral kinety composed of
ordinarily spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening.
Preoral kineties oblique, ordinarily to widely spaced, each composed of two to three narrowly spaced cilia
(Fig. 52l).
Occurrence and ecology: Foissner (1989) discovered M. polyvacuolatum in soil (pH 5.7) from a rice
field about 30 km east of the town of Kumamoto, Japan, where it was rather rare. schaDe in Foissner
(2000) found M. polyvacuolatum in artificial sand soil from sewage irrigation fields in Berlin-Buch and
Brandenburg, Germany. Further unpublished records come from terrestrial and semiterrestrial habitats of
Austria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the Maldives, indicating that M. polyvacuolatum is a
cosmopolitan. The Austrian population shown in Figs 52p–t is from a small road pool in the surroundings
of Salzburg University.

2008 Dimacrocaryon Jankowski, 1967 – lynn, Ciliated protozoa: 371 (list of genera)
Improved diagnosis: Small-sized Dimacrocaryonidae with narrow to very narrow body. Two macronuclear
nodules. Dorsal brush staggered and two-rowed. Right branch of circumoral kinety accompanied by
a perioral kinety, left branch by many slightly to strongly oblique preoral kineties. Oral bulge opening
dileptid, i.e., ovate or elliptical and located ventrally, length ≥ 10 µm. Oral basket a sac-like structure lined
by refractive granules.
Type species (by original designation): Dileptus amphileptoides kahl, 1931.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Greek numeral di (two), the adjective
makros (large), and the noun karyon (nucleus), referring to the two macronuclear nodules. Neuter
gender.
Remarks: Jankowski (1967) split Dileptus into several subgenera, according to the macronuclear pattern.
Dileptus amphileptoides became type of Dimacrocaryon, i.e., of dileptids with two macronuclear nodules.
Foissner (1984) doubted Jankowski’s action but raised D. amphileptoides to genus level because of its
special oral apparatus that did not show basket rods, not even in protargol preparations, and the oral
bulge opening that was narrowly elliptical and surrounded by strongly refractive granules impregnating
deeply with protargol. However, our transmission electronmicroscopical investigations showed a likely

ordinary oral basket (Figs 17a, b), but did not provide a reason for not impregnating with protargol in D.
amphileptoides and the two new species described below. The granules covering the basket entrance are
minute, oblong structures, possibly a special kind of mucocysts. Still, these granules are unique and an
excellent genus identifier in vivo and in protargol preparations.

Dimacrocaryon brasiliense nov. sp. (Figs 53a–o, 54c–h; Table 26)
Diagnosis: Size about 170 × 30 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid with proboscis about 37% of
body length and posterior end narrowly rounded. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles. Two size-types
(7 μm and 3 μm long) of rod-shaped extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge. On average 19 ciliary
rows, 2 staggered and differentiated into an isostichad dorsal brush: rows 1 and 2 composed of an average
of 14 and 18 dikinetids, respectively; both rows with a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to base of
proboscis. Oral bulge opening ovate, oral sac about 10 μm deep. Preoral kineties oblique to strongly
oblique, ordinarily spaced, each usually composed of 2 ordinarily to widely spaced cilia.
Type locality: Soil from the rainforest on a small island in the Rio Negro, Anavilhanas archipelago about
40 km west of the town of Manaus, Brazil, W60° S4°.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/364) and five paratype (inv. nos 2011/365–369) slides
with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective brasiliense refers to the country (Brazil) the species was discovered.
Description: Size 125–250 × 15–35 μm, usually about 170 × 30 μm in vivo, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming 15% preparation shrinkage (Table 26). Shape
narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with slightly to distinctly sigmoidal dorsal outline; proboscis crescentic,
about 37% of body length, leaf-like flattened; trunk oblong to bluntly fusiform, usually widest in mid-
portion, unflattened; posterior end rounded (Figs 53a, h–o). Nuclear apparatus slightly above mid of trunk,
may be dislocated by large food inclusions (Fig. 53i). Two macronuclear nodules with concave proximal
end surrounding micronucleus; individual nodules ovoidal to narrowly ovoidal, rarely curved; nucleoli
globular to ellipsoidal, distinct both in vivo and in protargol preparations. Micronucleus in between
macronuclear nodules, globular to slightly ellipsoidal, about 3 μm across, in protargol preparations
surrounded by a distinct membrane (Figs 53a, h–o, 54g). A row of contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of
cell, first vacuole at level of oral bulge opening; no ventral vacuoles (Fig. 53a). Two types of extrusomes
arranged in a row in broader right branch of oral bulge and scattered throughout cytoplasm in considerable
number: type I rod-shaped with slightly narrowed ends, about 7 × 0.8 μm in size, sparse in oral bulge,
frequent in cytoplasm, rarely impregnate with protargol; type II rod-shaped with rounded ends, about 3 ×
0.5 μm in size, numerous both in oral bulge and cytoplasm, does not stain with the protargol method used

(Figs 53a, b, c, 54c, d). Cortex very flexible, contains dense rows of rather refractive granules with a size of
about 0.8 × 0.4 μm (Figs 53d, 54h). Cytoplasm colourless and hyaline in the strongly flattened proboscis,
opaque and thus dark in posterior third of proboscis and throughout trunk due to numerous lipid droplets
up to 5 μm across and food vacuoles containing small testate amoebae (Euglypha sp., Schoenbornia
viscicula, Trinema lineare), fungal spores, probably ciliates and flagellates (Fig. 53i); in posterior body end
sometimes a 8 μm-sized defecation vacuole with crystalline contents. Movement without peculiarities.
Cilia about 10 μm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e.,
with thick, deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of 19 narrowly
to ordinarily spaced rows extending meridionally (Fig. 53h; Table 26). Right side rows shortened only
in anterior fifth of proboscis, producing a short suture; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with
loosely spaced basal bodies (Fig. 53g). Left side of proboscis with broad blank stripe because ciliary rows
end at level of oral bulge opening, except for one or two kineties extending to or above proximal half of
proboscis (Figs 53e, h). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of two staggered,
isostichad rows each with a monokinetidal bristle tail. Brush row 1 commences more posteriorly than row
2, composed of an average of 14 widely spaced dikinetids. Brush row 2 begins subapically, composed of
an average of 18 ordinarily to widely spaced dikinetids (Fig. 53f). Three types of bristles but only two
types are recognizable in protargol preparations: anterior portion of rows with about 5 μm long type IV
bristles followed by some 3 μm long type I bristles; posterior third composed of 2 μm long monokinetidal
type VI bristles (Figs 53a, g, h). Brush structure difficult to recognize in lateral view due to the strong
flattening of the proboscis.
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body third, hardly projecting because base of proboscis almost as
wide as trunk, ovate in vivo, elliptical in protargol preparations (Figs 53a, c, e). Oral sac about 10 μm
deep in vivo, lined with conspicuous granules about 2 × 0.8 μm in size, well recognizable in vivo and in
protargol preparations because rather deeply impregnating; granulated area roughly elliptical, usually with
a minute posterior elongation recognizable only in lateral view (Figs 53a, c, e, h–o, 54e–g). Oral ciliary

pattern dileptid but with a remarkable specialization, viz., a preoral narrowing of the oral bulge/circumoral
kinety. Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced dikinetids in proboscis and of narrowly spaced
monokinetids around oral bulge opening; right branch curves around anterior end of proboscis, while left
branch ends subapically almost touching the curved right end. Preoral kineties oblique to strongly oblique,
ordinarily spaced, each composed of only two, rarely three ordinarily to widely spaced monokinetids,
forming almost a line in anterior half of proboscis (Figs 53e, h).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, that is, in soil of a terra firma primary (?)
rainforest on one of the many small islands in the Rio Negro (black Amazon) about 10 m above low water
level and thus not or rarely flooded during high water periods. The sample consisted of litter, roots, and
soil from 0–10 cm. Litter layer 2–5 cm thick and with many fungal hyphae, followed by an about 5 cm
thick, very dense root carpet mixed with brown, humic soil; mineral soil under root carpet loamy-sandy
and brownish, yellowish down to 10 cm; pH 5.1. This species is remarkable by ingesting one to three
testate amoebae up to 40 μm long, showing that the oral sac is very effective and can open widely.
Remarks: Dimacrocaryon brasiliense differs from D. arenicola, which occurs also in Brazil and is
described below, by the type I extrusomes (rod-shaped vs. very narrowly ovate and asymmetric) and
the shape of the oral bulge opening (ovate vs. very narrowly elliptical). Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides
differs from D. brasiliense in having a very narrowly elliptical (vs. ovate) oral bulge opening and a deeper
oral sac (~ 10 μm vs. < 5 μm). Further, D. amphileptoides possesses only one type of extrusomes which,
however, are very similar to those of D. brasiliense.
Dimacrocaryon arenicola nov. sp. (Figs 55a–o; Table 26)
Diagnosis: Size about 170 × 30 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly dileptid with proboscis about 35% of body
length and posterior end narrowly rounded. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles. Two types of extrusomes
attached to proboscis oral bulge: type I very narrowly ovate and asymmetric, about 5 × 1 μm in size; type
II rod-shaped, 4 μm long. On average 17 ciliary rows, 2 staggered and differentiated into an isostichad
dorsal brush: rows 1 and 2 composed of an average of 11 and 16 dikinetids, respectively; both rows with
a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening very narrowly elliptical,
oral sac about 5 μm deep. Preoral kineties strongly oblique, ordinarily spaced, each usually composed of
2 ordinarily to widely spaced cilia.
Type locality: Sandy soil from the Restingha area in the surroundings of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, W43°
S23°.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/355) and eight paratype slides (inv. nos 2011/356–363)
with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin word arenicola (living in sand) alludes to the habitat where the species was
discovered.
Description and comparison with similar species: The new species has a very similar overall morphology
as D. brasiliense described above; it matches, inter alia, in body shape, the nuclear and contractile vacuole
apparatus, and the ciliary pattern (Figs 55a, f, g, i). Moreover, the morphometric features overlap considerably
(Table 26). Thus, the reader is referred to D. brasiliense for a general description. The differences between
D. arenicola and D. brasiliense are as follows: (1) type I extrusomes very narrowly ovate and asymmetric
vs. rod-shaped and symmetric (cf. Fig. 55e and 53b); (2) oral bulge opening very narrowly elliptical vs.
ovate (cf. Fig. 55d and 53c); (3) oral sac flat (< 5 μm) vs. deep (~ 10 μm). Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides
has only oblong extrusomes.

Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only in the surroundings of Rio de Janeiro, namely, in the very
sandy Restingha area about 100 m inshore the Atlantic coast, where the ground is covered by bushes and
grass and an up to 1 cm high litter layer. The sample consisted of sandy soil, surface litter, and plant debris
sieved off the very sandy soil up to a depth of 10 cm.
Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides (kahl, 1931) Jankowski, 1967
1931 Dileptus amphileptoides spec. n. kahl, Tierwelt Dtl. 21: 208
Taxonomy: We split this species into two subspecies, mainly due to the contractile vacuoles which
either form a stripe in ventral and dorsal side of trunk (D. amphileptoides amphileptoides) or only in
dorsal side (D. amphileptoides paucivacuolatum). Possibly, D. amphileptoides paucivacuolatum is larger,
has more ciliary rows, and a different extrusome pattern; however, this must be substantiated by the
investigation of further populations, before they can be included into the diagnosis. Our notes indicate that
D. amphileptoides amphileptoides is more common than D. amphileptoides paucivacuolatum.
Improved diagnosis (includes two subspecies and all data known): Size about 200 × 35 µm in vivo,
rarely 250–400 µm long. Shape on average narrowly to very narrowly dileptid with proboscis frequently
rather distinctly sickle-shaped and 1/3 of body length; posterior end narrowly rounded to acute. A dorsal
and ventral stripe of contractile vacuoles or only a dorsal stripe. Extrusomes oblong, 3–5 µm long. On
average about 19 or 27 ciliary rows, 2 staggered and differentiated into an isostichad dorsal brush with
monokinetidal bristle tails extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening very narrowly elliptical.
Preoral kineties oblique to strongly oblique, ordinarily spaced, each usually composed of 3 narrowly
spaced cilia.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The epithet possibly refers to the narrow mouth resembling
that of the pleurostomatid genus Amphileptus.

1984 Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides (kahl, 1931) – Foissner, Stapfia 12: 92 (partim, population II)
Diagnosis: A stripe of contractile vacuoles each in dorsal and ventral side of cell.
Type locality: kahl (1931) mentioned three sites, i.e., Mittenwald and Berchtesgaden in southern Bavaria
and the Zillertal in Tyrol, Austria, but did not fix any as the type locality. The neotype is from soil of an
alder stand (Alnetum viridis) on the Stubnerkogel near Bad Gastein, Salzburg, Austria E13°6’ N47°7’
(Foissner 1984). According to Article 76.3 of the ICZN (1999), the place of origin of the neotype becomes
the type locality of the nominal species-group taxon, despite any previously published statement of the
type locality.
Neotypification and voucher material: Neotypification was not explicitely mentioned by Foissner
(1984), who deposited two slides (inv. no. 1982/54, mislabelled as Dileptoides amphileptoides; and 1984/8,
mislabelled as Rimaleptus amphileptoides; aescht 2008). The slide 1982/54 is declared here as a neotype
for D. amphileptoides amphileptoides, while the slide 1984/8 is used as a holotype for D. amphileptoides
paucivacuolatum (see below). Further, we have deposited five slides (inv. nos 2011/371–375) from the
Gastein type series and four voucher slides (inv. nos 2011/376–379) of a population from a pine forest

near Oslo, Norway. Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. All slides are
deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI).
The neotypification is supported here because (i) no type material is available from kahl’s (1931) specimens,
(ii) the identity is treated by the subspecies paucivacuolatum and the rather similar D. arenicola, (iii) there
are no doubts on the identification, (iv) the neotype is from the same biogeographic region and a similar
habitat, and (v) the preparations are of good quality.
Description: The description is based on the data of kahl (1931) and wenzel (1953) as well as on
our detailed, unpublished observations on two populations from the Austrian Central Alps (Gastein area,
170

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
Alnetum viridis on the Stubnerkogel, Taxotop D in Foissner & Peer 1985; Bad Hofgastein area, alpine
pasture on the Schlossalm). Further, selected features and morphometric data were studied in a Norwegian
population found in mixed forest litter about 135 km NW of the town of Oslo.
Length in vivo 250–400 µm (kahl 1931); 170–250 µm (on average 205 µm, n = 8) according to wenzel
(1953); 180 × 35 µm (original data from two alpine populations and three specimens); and 115–220 × 20–
47 µm, on average 170 × 29 µm in two protargol-impregnated populations (Table 27), corresponding to an
in vivo size of about 200 × 35 µm, if 15% preparation shrinkage is added. kahl’s length hardly reached by
even the extreme values, indicating strong variability or a measurement error. Shape on average narrowly
to cylindroidally dileptid with proboscis more or less distinctly sickle-shaped, occupying about one third
of body length; posterior end narrowly rounded or acute, never tail-like; trunk slightly to distinctly (~
2:1) flattened, proboscis sometimes leaf-like. Specimens often slightly, rarely fairly distinctly spiralized,
especially the proboscis, and sometimes deformed by large food inclusions, mainly testate amoebae (Figs
54a, 56a, c–e, 57a, e, i–k, q). Nuclear apparatus in or near central third of trunk, may be strongly displaced
by large food inclusions (Fig. 57c). Macronuclear nodules comparatively small, i.e., on avarage 20–24 ×
6 µm after protargol impregnation; shape rather variable: oblong, bluntly clavate, nodulated, or slightly
spiralized; nucleoli distinct, globular. Invariably a single micronucleus in between macronuclear nodules,
2–3.5 µm across in vivo (Figs 56a, c–e, 57f; Table 27). Contractile vacuoles in ventral and dorsal side of
trunk, likely scattered throughout cell, except of proboscis. In rear end frequently a defecation vacuole
with slimy, granular contents (Figs 56a, c–e, 57f, h, i). Extrusomes inconspicuous because oblong (rarely
very slightly widened proximally) and only 3–5 µm long in four populations investigated, attached to
broader right branch of proboscis oral bulge and scattered in cytoplasm; do not impregnate with the
protargol method used (Figs 56a–e, l, m, 57g). Cortex very flexible and colourless, studded with minute
granules, forming slightly oblique rows, as in other dileptids; rather distinctly furrowed by the ciliary rows
(Figs 54a, 56h, 57a, h). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline or studded with lipid droplets up to 5 µm across and
food vacuoles with testate amoebae (Fig. 57c), silicoflagellates (Figs 7a, b), and possibly also bacteria and
ciliates. Swims and glides clumsily between soil particles.
The somatic and oral ciliary pattern as well as the structure of the oral bulge opening of the two subspecies
are highly similar, except of small morphometric differences (Table 27). Thus, the following description
applies to both.
Cilia 8–10 µm long in vivo, widely spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptides, i.e., with
thick, deeply impregnating distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of about 19 (D.
amphileptoides amphileptoides) or 27 (D. amphileptoides paucivacuolata) narrowly to ordinarily spaced
rows extending meridionally. Right side rows shortened only in anterior region of proboscis; first row
right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety to tip of proboscis with narrowly to ordinarily spaced
basal bodies. Left side of proboscis with broad and thus conspicuous blank stripe because ciliary rows
end at level of oral bulge opening, except for one or two kineties extending to or above proximal half of
proboscis (Figs 54a, b, 56i, n–q, 57a, e). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of
two staggered, isostichad rows each with a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to level of oral opening.
Brush row 1 commences slightly more posteriorly than row 2, composed of an average of 14 ordinarily
spaced dikinetids in Norwegian specimens; brush row 2 commences subapically, composed of an average
of 17 ordinarily spaced dikinetids. Brush bristles slightly clavate, can move forward and backward, about
5 µm long in middle third of brush, gradually decreasing to about 3 µm at brush ends; tail bristles widely
spaced, about 1 µm long (Figs 54a, b, 56a, c, d, i, o–q, 57e, g, m, n; Table 27).
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body third, inconspicuous because hardly projecting from body
proper and so flat that often difficult to recognize in vivo and in the scanning electron microscope (Figs

as typical for the genus. B – dorsal brush, CK – circumoral kinety, MA – macronuclear nodule, N – nematodesmata,

57a, b, d, f, i–k, l). Oral sac up to 5 µm deep, lined by refractive, protargol-affine granules about 1 × 0.5
µm in size, as typical for the genus; nematodesmata recognizable only in the electron microscope (Figs
17a, b, 56a–e, i–k, n–p, 57a, b, d). Oral cilia about 10 µm long in vivo, form nice metachronal waves (Fig.
57b), arranged in dileptid pattern, but with two remarkable specializations, viz., a preoral narrowing of
the oral bulge/circumoral kinety and an only 1–2 µm wide oral bulge surface (measured between branches
of circumoral kinety). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily to widely spaced dikinetids associated
with rather distinct nematodesmata and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening. Preoral
kineties composed of two to four ordinarily spaced monokinetids forming almost a line in anterior third of
proboscis (Figs 54b, 56n–p, 57n).
Resting cyst (Figs 56f, 57o, p, r–t): This was studied in the Norwegian population of D. amphileptoides
amphileptoides. The spherical cysts have a diameter of 40–51 µm (on average 42.8 µm, n = 8) and are
morphologically inconspicuous, i.e., have a smooth, colourless, about 1.5 µm thick wall, which stains
pink with methyl green-pyronin. The cyst’s periphery is packed with minute granules (≤ 0.5 µm), forming
an opaque layer, while the central portion contains the nuclear apparatus, many lipid droplets 0.5–2 µm
across, and some autophagous vacuoles up to 4 µm in size. The extrusomes and contractile vacuoles

Occurrence and ecology: See D. amphileptoides paucivacuolatum.
Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides paucivacuolatum nov. ssp. (Figs 56g–k, n–q; Table 27)
1984 Dimacrocaryon amphileptoides (kahl, 1931) – Foissner, Stapfia 12: 92 (partim, population I)
Nomenclature and taxonomy: We establish a new subspecies for population I of the D. amphileptoides
described by Foissner (1984); for reasoning, see taxonomy of D. amphileptoides. This is in accordance
with Article 72.3 of the ICZN (1999) because we fix a holotype below.
Diagnosis: A stripe of contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of cell.
Type locality: Wall mosses from the park of the castle Rauisch-Holzhausen, outskirts of the town of
Giessen, Germany, E11°25’ N47°4’.
Type material: One neotype slide [inv. no. 1984/8; mislabelled as “Rimaleptus amphileptoides (Genotyp)
Giessen 1984”] with protargol-impregnated German specimens (population I), as investigated by Foissner
(1984), is withdrawn and here used as a holotype slide for the new subspecies. Specifically, we declare the
specimen shown in Fig. 56n of this monograph as the holotype of D. amphileptoides paucivacuolatum.
This specimen and several syntype specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. Further
slide (inv. no. 1984/70) belongs to this series, and is thus a paratype (aescht 2008). The holotype and the
paratype slide are deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI).
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective paucus (few), the thematic vowel i, and the Latin noun
vacuola (vacuole), referring to the decreased number of contractile vacuoles when compared with D.
amphileptoides amphileptoides.
Description: Detailed data are available only for the type population (Foissner 1984). A second population
has been found in a soil sample from Gough Island, Antarctica (Foissner 1996b), but was not studied in
detail.
As described in the taxonomy section, the subspecies paucivacuolatum has contractile vacuoles only in
the dorsal side of the trunk. Other differences need to be substantiated in further populations, before they
can be included in the diagnosis. These are (Table 27): body size in vivo about 230 × 30 µm vs. 200 × 35
µm; number of ciliary rows 27 vs. up to 22; and the arrangement of the extrusomes (scattered in broader
right branch of oral bulge vs. in a single row, Figs 56j–l). A reinvestigation of the type population showed
that there are two dorsal brush rows, only one out of 16 specimens analyzed has three rows, as stated by
Foissner (1984). Further, the Bavarian specimens have narrowed the circumoral kinety preorally, as the
congeners and the subspecies amphileptoides, and the oral sac is ≤ 5 µm deep, as in D. arenicola.
Some other observations should be also mentioned, as far as they are different from the other subspecies:
(i) contractile by about one third of body length, but possibly only under slight coverslip pressure; (ii)
trunk cylindroidal, rarely slightly flattened; (iii) extrusomes only 3 µm long and thus conspicuously short;
(iv) trunk usually studded with globular inclusions up to 10 µm across; (v) feeds on the testate amoeba
Euglypha rotunda, fungal conidia, and green algae.
Occurrence and ecology: If not mentioned otherwise, the following data concern both subspecies because
they were rarely separated before. According to Foissner (1998), D. amphileptoides is a cosmopolitan,
occurring even in the Antarctic region (Foissner 1996b). Most records are from terrestrial and semi-
terrestrial habitats. However, there are also several unsubstantiated records from a variety of running
waters in Slovakia (szentiVány & tirJakoVá 1994; krno et al. 1995; matis et al. 1996; tirJakoVá 1997a,
178

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
1997b; tirJakoVá & stloukal 2004). Further, it has been found in abandoned, sewage-irrigated, sandy
soil in Berlin (Foissner 2000).
kahl (1931) discovered D. amphileptoides amphileptoides in mosses on limestone from southern Bavaria
(Mittenwald and Berchtesgaden), where it was frequent, while it was rare in mosses from granitic rocks
in the Zillertal, Austria. Later, D. amphileptoides has been recorded from a great variety of habitats in
Germany and Austria (wenzel 1953; Foissner 1987a, 1988b, 2000; lehle 1989; Foissner et al. 2005).
The description of D. amphileptoides paucivacuolatum is based on a population from wall mosses of a
castle in the outskirts of the town of Giessen (Foissner 1984). Further, we observed D. amphileptoides
amphileptoides in a mixed forest about 150 km NW of the town of Oslo, Norway (Figs 7a–c, 9c, e–h,
17a–d, 57a–t).
stout (1968) found D. amphileptoides infrequently in mor humus of a beech forest in Denmark, and
esteBan et al. (2006) recorded it from upland grassland in England. wang (1977) recorded it from the
Tibetan Plateau, and yang (1989) found it during winter in freshwaters of the Yuelushan area, China.
Foissner (2008) found it in sandy coastal soil of Singapore; from litter and soil of the Santa Rosa National
Park in Costa Rica (Foissner 1995a); and from soil of the Amazon floodplain near the town of Iquitos,
Peru (Foissner 1997b). Blatterer & Foissner (1988) reported D. amphileptoides in 6 out of 21 litter and
soil samples from Australia, viz., the Brisbane Water National Park and forests in the surroundings of the
town of Adelaide. stout (1961) found D. amphileptoides in lightly burnt soils from New Zealand.
Little is known on the ecology of D. amphileptoides. Basically, it is an omnivore, preferring small testate
amoebae as food (Fig. 57c). But other matters are also ingested (Foissner 1998): green algae, autotrophic
and heterotrophic flagellates (Figs 7a, b), hyphae and spores of fungi, and possibly also bacteria and
ciliates. The great variety of habitats it has been reported indicates a wide ecological range.

2008 Rimaleptus Foissner, 1984 – lynn, Ciliated protozoa: 371 (list of genera)
Improved diagnosis: Small- to medium-sized Dimacrocaryonidae with broad to rod-shaped, rarely
rostrate body. Two macronuclear nodules. Dorsal brush staggered and two- or multi-rowed. Right branch
of circumoral kinety accompanied by a perioral kinety, left branch by many slightly to strongly oblique
preoral kineties. Oral bulge opening dileptid, i.e., roundish or ovate and located ventrally, length usually
≥ 10 µm. Oral basket bulbous or obconical.
Type species (by original designation): Dileptus binucleatus kahl, 1931.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Latin noun rima (cleft, gap) and the
Greek adjective leptos (thin, slender), referring to the tiny generic gap between Dimacrocaryon and other
binucleate species. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Although the nuclear pattern is as in Dimacrocaryon, Foissner (1984) established the genus
Rimaleptus for binucleate dileptids which have an ordinary oral basket not lined by the curious granules so
typical for Dimacrocaryon. Very likely, Rimaleptus and Dimacrocaryon are closely related because they
have the same nuclear and ciliary pattern.
Foissner (1984) included only one species in Rimaleptus, viz., Dileptus binucleatus. In this monograph,
179

we add two new species and 15 binucleate Dileptus species. Rimaleptus contains at least two organization
types, indicating that it might be polyphyletic. The first lineage, the R. alpinus group, comprises small to
medium-sized species with two contractile vacuoles. The second lineage, the R. mucronatus group, collects
small to middle-sized species with many contractile vacuoles. These two groups collate 12 species. The
remaining six species are too incompletely described to be classified.

1963 Dileptus ovalis VuXanoVici, 1959 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 124 (first taxonomic reviser)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus ovalis with Rimaleptus because of the two
macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Full redescription is required although this species
is easily identified by the broad body, the long proboscis, the broadly rounded posterior end, the peculiar
contractile vacuole pattern, and the presence of symbiotic green algae. There are only three congeners
with zoochlorellae: R. marouensis, R. nistroviensis and R. robustus, all having a narrowly to very narrowly
dileptid body with an acute posterior third or a distinct tail.
Diagnosis: Length about 160 μm in vivo. Shape broadly dileptid with broadly rounded posterior end,
proboscis about 1/2 of body length. Two globular, slightly separate macronuclear nodules. One contractile
vacuole underneath oral bulge opening and three in dorsal side of trunk. With symbiotic green algae
(zoochlorellae).
Type locality: Coast of Lake Floreasca, Bucharest, Roumania, E26°6’ N44°28’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective ovalis obviously refers to the broad
trunk.
Description (type population): Length about 160 μm in vivo; slightly contractile. Shape broadly dileptid
with a length:width ratio of 3:2 in extended specimens, while about 2.5:1 according to the figure provided
(Fig. 58a). Proboscis half of body length or longer, distinctly set off from trunk, 8 μm wide at base and
6 μm at tip. Trunk of extended specimens broadly ellipsoidal, becoming globular in contracted (dying?
authors) cells. Nuclear apparatus in middle portion of trunk; composed of two globular, slightly separate
macronuclear nodules each about 11 μm across; micronuclei not studied. Contractile vacuole pattern
extraordinary, that is, one vacuole posterior to oral bulge opening and three in dorsal side of trunk; first
dorsal vacuole at level of ventral one. Extrusomes very fine, attached to proboscis oral bulge. Cytoplasm
hyaline and transparent in proboscis, while opaque and green in trunk because packed with numerous
refractile granules and globular, minute algae (zoochlorellae). Ciliature not studied. Pharyngeal basket
inconspicuous as composed of fine, 9 μm-long rods. Swims slowly in circles 150–200 μm across by
rotation about main body axis moving the proboscis to and fro (Figs 58a, b).
Occurrence and ecology: VuXanoVici (1959) discovered Rimaleptus ovalis in a sample with marsh plants
from Lake Floreasca in Bucharest, Roumania during February 1958. Later, he found a single specimen
on the coast of Lake Herǎstrǎu in the vicinity of Lake Floreasca in May 1958. Very likely, this was
a reorganizing cell or another species because it possessed many scattered macronuclear nodules and
several ventral contractile vacuoles connected by a canal.

Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus nistroviensis with Rimaleptus because of the two
macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Full redescription is required because many important
features have not been described. Rimaleptus nistroviensis belongs to the small group of binucleate
dileptids with symbiotic green algae, but is identified by the single subterminal contractile vacuole (very
questionable, authors) and, possibly, by the extrusomes attached both to the proboscis oral bulge and the
ventral side of the trunk, a unique feature as yet not found in any other dileptid, but highly reminiscent of
the spathidiid genus Cultellothrix (Foissner & Xu 2007).
Diagnosis: Length about 180 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid with distinct tail, proboscis up to
half of body length. Two ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules each with a single micronucleus. Possibly a
single contractile vacuole at base of tail. Extrusomes slightly curved rods attached to proboscis oral bulge
and, possibly, to ventral side of trunk. With symbiotic green algae (zoochlorellae).
Type locality: Sand from the Dniester River, Moldavia.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective nistroviensis refers to the Dniester
River in which the species was discovered.
Description: Length 170–190 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of about
6.5:1, according to the figure provided. Proboscis occupies up to half of body length, slightly set off from
oblong trunk; posterior end with distinct tail. Nuclear apparatus in middle portion of trunk, composed
of two ellipsoidal, 15 μm-long macronuclear nodules each with a single micronucleus 4–5 μm across.
A single contractile (defecation?) vacuole at base of tail. Extrusomes not described but figured as fine,
slightly curved rods attached to both proboscis oral bulge and ventral side of trunk. Cytoplasm packed
with symbiotic green algae (zoochlorellae). About nine meridionally arranged ciliary rows on one side of
cell, according to the figure provided (Fig. 58e).
Occurrence and ecology: Rimaleptus nistroviensis was discovered in the sandy benthos of the Dniester
River with an abundance of 20,000 ind./m2 in October (chorik 1967, 1968); later, it was found in the
plankton from the Barnaulka River, Altai region, Russia (èJDukaJtene et al. 2004).

1963 Dileptus robustus VuXanoVici, 1959 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 125 (first taxonomic reviser)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus robustus with Rimaleptus because of the two
macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Full redescription is required because many important
features have not been described. In having symbiotic green algae, R. robustus is most similar to R.
marouensis, R. nistroviensis and R. ovalis, but has conspicuously thick (vs. thin) extrusomes. Additionally,
R. marouensis is distinguished by the shape of the macronuclear nodules (pyriform vs. globular); R.
nistroviensis possibly differs by the contractile vacuole (a single subterminal vacuole vs. a dorsal row of
vacuoles) and extrusome (attached to proboscis oral bulge and ventral side of trunk vs. only to proboscis
oral bulge) pattern; and R. ovalis has a broadly (vs. narrowly) dileptid body and a different contractile
vacuole pattern (one vacuole underneath oral bulge opening and three vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk vs.
dorsal stripe of vacuoles).
Diagnosis: Length about 300 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly dileptid with acute posterior end, proboscis about
1/4 of body length. Two globular, slightly separate macronuclear nodules. A dorsal stripe of contractile
vacuoles. Extrusomes thick and about 8 μm long. About 15 ciliary rows on one side of cell. With symbiotic
green algae (zoochlorellae).

Type locality: Coast of Lake Herǎstrǎu, Bucharest, Roumania, E26°05’ N44°28’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective robustus possibly refers to the thick
extrusomes.
Description: VuXanoVici’s description is based on a single specimen observed in March 1958. Length 305
μm in vivo; slightly contractile. Shape narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of 4.8:1, according to the
figure provided. Proboscis about one fourth of body length, distinctly set off from bluntly fusiform trunk,
24 μm wide at base and 15 μm at tip; posterior end acute, not disappearing when cell contracts (Fig. 58d).
Nuclear apparatus in middle portion of trunk; composed of two globular, slightly separate macronuclear
nodules each about 12 μm across; micronuclei not studied. A dorsal stripe of eight contractile vacuoles
beginning in mid-proboscis. Extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge, thick and hence well recognizable
at a magnification of ×280, about 8 μm long. Cytoplasm transparent, green due to many minute globular
algae (zoochlorellae) 3–6 μm across. Cilia 4–5 μm long in vivo, arranged in 14–16 meridional rows on
one side of cell; dorsal bristles short, recognizable in the preserved specimen. Oral basket short and fine
(Fig. 58c).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only in a 10-day old water sample with decaying plants.

revision)
1988 Dileptus maronensis Dragesco, 1963 – song, PackroFF & wilBert, Acta Protozool. 27: 275 (incorrect
subsequent spelling and therefore unavailable according to Articles 33.3 and 33.5 of the ICZN 1999)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus marouensis with Rimaleptus because of the
two macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Full redescription is required because several
important features have not been described, e.g., the extrusomes. Rimaleptus marouensis was studied in
two populations, namely from Cameroun, Africa (Dragesco 1963) and Upper Savoy, France (Dragesco
1966a). They match very well in body shape and size and, especially, the pyriform shape of the macronuclear
nodules, which are globular, ovate or oblong in most congeners. However, the French population differs
from the African type by the lack of symbiotic green algae and may thus represent a distinct subspecies
or species. Therefore, the diagnosis includes only data from the type population, while the description
contains all observations.
Diagnosis (type population): Length about 300 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid with distinct tail,
proboscis about 40% of body length. Two pyriform macronuclear nodules with a single micronucleus in
between. Two to four dorsal contractile vacuoles. With symbiotic green algae (zoochlorellae).
Type locality: Sand from a river in the village of Maroua, North Cameroun, Africa, E14°19’ N10°36’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective marouensis obviously refers to the type
locality.
Description: African type specimens about 300 μm long (Dragesco 1963, Dragesco & Dragesco-
kernéis 1986), French cells 250 μm on average (Dragesco 1966a). Shape very narrowly dileptid with a
length:width ratio of about 7:1, according to the figures provided (Figs 58f, h, i). Proboscis occupies about
184

40% of body length, distinctly set off from bluntly fusiform trunk; posterior end with distinct tail. Nuclear
apparatus in middle portion of trunk. Macronuclear nodules pyriform or bluntly clavate; many small to
medium-sized nucleoli in French specimens. Micronucleus in between macronuclear nodules, globular,
surrounded by a distinct membrane in Feulgen preparations (Figs 58f–i). Two to four dorsal contractile
vacuoles; very likely, Dragesco (1963) and Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis (1986) misinterpreted the
subterminal defecation vacuole as an additional contractile vacuole. African specimens green because
packed with symbiotic algae, absent in French cells. French specimens with 28–30 ciliary rows (Dragesco
1966a).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at type locality (Dragesco 1963) and in sand from the Excenevex
beach, Lake Léman, Upper Savoy, France (Dragesco 1966a).
Rimaleptus lacazei (gourrEt & roEsEr, 1886) nov. comb. (Figs 58m–s)
1886 Amphileptus lacazei (nov. sp.) gourret & roeser, Archs Zool. exp. gén. 4: 468
1931 Dileptus (Amphileptus) lacazei (gourr. u. R., 1886) – kahl, Tierwelt Dtl. 21: 208 (first taxonomic reviser,
combination with Dileptus)
1963 Dileptus lacazei (gourr. et roes., 1886) – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 121 (second taxonomic reviser,
redescription)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus lacazei with Rimaleptus because of the two
macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Full redescription is required because important features,
such as the extrusomes and morphometric data are lacking. Within the binucleate dileptids, R. lacazei is
outstanding in having (i) a highly contractile proboscis and (ii) trunk protuberances with slightly elongated
cilia. The first feature was emphasized in the original description and later confirmed by Dragesco (1963)
in another French population. Interestingly, there are only two other highly contractile dileptids, viz.,
Monomacrocaryon tenue with an oblong macronucleus and Pseudomonilicaryon dimorphum with four
macronuclear nodules. Among the congeners, R. lacazei resembles R. tirjakovae, which also lives in saline
environments and possesses two globular macronuclear nodules. However, R. tirjakovae is acontractile
and has an acute posterior body third (vs. a distinct tail).
Diagnosis (includes all information known): Length about 500 μm in vivo, contracts to less than 200
µm. Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like with long tail, proboscis highly contractile and about 1/2 of
body length in extended cells. Two globular macronuclear nodules with a single micronucleus in between.
Possibly a single contractile vacuole at base of tail. Cortex of trunk with small protuberances, bearing
slightly elongated cilia.
Type locality: Brackish water from the wharf of Huiles in Marseille, France, E5°21’ N43°19’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: gourret & roeser (1886) dedicated this species to Prof. H. de lacaze-Duthiers.
Description: Rimaleptus lacazei was very incompletely described by gourret & roeser (1886).
Fortunately, Dragesco (1963) found a dileptid highly resembling gourret & roeser’s species in body
shape, the pronounced contractility of the proboscis, the nuclear and contractile vacuole pattern as well as
the marine habitat. Therefore, all data are put together emphasizing Dragesco’s observations.
Length of contracted to semi-contracted cells about 200 μm in type population (gourret & roeser 1886)
and 180–290 μm in Dragesco’s specimens; fully extended cells over 500 μm long. Shape of contracted
specimens very narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of 7.5–8.5:1 (Figs 58m–o, s), fully extended
cells cylindroidally dileptid to rod-like with a length:width ratio of 10–16:1 (Figs 58p–r). Proboscis very
conspicuous because usually occupying half or more of body length, highly contractile and flexible,
185

filiform and thus distinctly set off from trunk; in contracted cells shortened to a very narrowly triangular
structure. Trunk bluntly fusiform, more or less flattened, only slightly broadened in contracted specimens.
Tail occupies 15–25% of body length, distinctly set off from trunk, pointed posteriorly. Nuclear apparatus
in middle portion of trunk, composed of two globular to broadly ellipsoidal macronuclear nodules with
a single micronucleus in between; one nucleolus in centre of each nodule in type specimens. Contractile
(defecation?) vacuole and cytopyge near base of tail. Extrusomes not described. Cortex of trunk with small
protuberances bearing bundles of slightly elongated cilia in type population; not mentioned by Dragesco
(1963). Cytoplasm colourless and hyaline, strongly vacuolated in Dragesco’s specimens. Number of
kineties not known, possibly few when the figure of gourret & roeser (1886) is assumed to be correct
(Fig. 58m). Pharyngeal basket obconical, short (Figs 58m–s).
Occurrence and ecology: Rimaleptus lacazei was discovered in brackish water from the wharf of Huiles
in Marseille, France (gourret & roeser 1886). Later, it was found near the type locality, i.e., the harbor
of the town of Nice (Dragesco 1963). There are unsubstantiated limnetic record from the benthos of Lake
Suviana, Tusco-Emilian Apennines, Italy (maDoni 1989, Dini et al. 1995) and the water bodies from the
Apsheron Peninsula, Azerbaijan (agamalieV & alieV 1978; misspelled as Dileptus legazei).

1963 Dileptus gabonensis n. sp. (?) Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 128 (unavailable)
1986 Dileptus gabonensis Dragesco, 1963 – Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis, Faune tropicale 26: 163 (taxonomic
revision)
Nomenclature: This species is not available in 1963 because it was conditionally proposed (Article 15.1 of
the ICZN 1999). Thus, we use the date 1986, when Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis removed the question
mark without providing a reason, however.
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus gabonensis with Rimaleptus because of the
two macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Rimaleptus gabonensis is a poorly described
species, but easily distinguished from all congeners, except for R. lacazei, by the very long tail. Rimaleptus
lacazei differs from R. gabonensis by the larger (over 500 µm vs. 300 µm) and highly contractile (vs. not
contractile) body.
Diagnosis: Length about 300 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid with long tail, proboscis about
40% of body length. Two oblong macronuclear nodules with a single micronucleus in between. Possibly
a single contractile vacuole at base of tail.
Type locality: Sand from the village of Makokou, Gabon, Africa, E12°51’ N33°50’. Neither Dragesco
(1963) nor Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis (1986) specified the habitat.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective gabonensis obviously refers to the
country (Gabon) in which the species was discovered.
Description: Length about 300 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of about
8:1, according to the figures provided. Proboscis about 40% of body length, slightly set off from bluntly
fusiform trunk, distinctly widened preorally; tail conspicuous because occupying about one fourth of body
length. Nuclear apparatus in middle portion of trunk, composed of two oblong macronuclear nodules and
a single micronucleus in between. Contractile (defecation?) vacuole at base of tail. Extrusomes, ciliature
and oral apparatus not described.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality.

The Rimaleptus alpinus group
The six species of this group have two contractile vacuoles and two dorsal brush rows, except for R.
binucleatus and R. conspicuus in which it is multi-rowed. Body shape and size as well as proboscis length
and extrusome shape are rather different and thus useful species discriminators. Likewise, the number of
ciliary rows and specialities separate some species easily and distinctly (Table 28).

tirJakoVá 1997a and tirJakoVá & stloukal 2004)
Generic affiliation, nomenclature and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus conspicuus with Rimaleptus
because of the two macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. gellért (1955) described Dileptus
conspicuus var. telobivacuolatus as follows (Fig. 59c): “Das Tier stimmt in jeder Beziehung mit Kahls
Form überein, dennoch musste es als eine neue Varietät beschrieben werden, weil seine beiden pulsierenden
Vakuolen terminal liegen, wogegen bei der typischen Form die eine Vakuole terminal, die andere in Höhe
der Mundöffnung dorsal liegt. Von den beiden Vakuolen ist die ventrale stets kleiner, ihre Entleerungszeit
beträgt 40 Sekunden, während die dorsal liegende Vakuole grösser ist, mit einer Entleerungszeit von 55
Sekunden. Gegenüber der 200 µm langen Form von kahl, beträgt die Länge des vorliegenden Exemplares
nur 110–120 µm. Plasma hell, bläulichgrün. Bewegung langsam, schwankend. Raubtier: ernährt sich
von Protozoen. Kommt nicht häufig vor.” If gellért’s observations can be confirmed, then Rimaleptus
conspicuus should be split into two subspecies because the vacuole pattern is an important feature.
Foissner (1989) neotypified R. conspicuus with an Icelandic population, but did not provide the reasons.
187

However, we support the neotypification because (i) no type material is available from kahl’s (1931)
specimens, (ii) the type locality is unclear, (iii) there are no doubts on the identification, (iv) the neotype is
from the same biogeographic region and a similar habitat, and (v) the preparations are of good quality.
Within the binucleate dileptids, R. conspicuus is easily identified by the conspicuously rostrate proboscis.
All congeners, except for R. similis, have a filiform or only slightly rostrate proboscis. Rimaleptus similis
differs from R. conspicuus by the larger body size (on average 219 µm vs. 141 µm in protargol preparations),
the less rostrate proboscis, and the higher number of contractile vacuoles (at least four vs. two).
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 150 × 55 μm in vivo. Shape dileptid to
narrowly dileptid with broady rounded posterior end, proboscis conspicuously rostrate and about half of
body length. Two oblong macronuclear nodules with 1–2 micronuclei in between. Two dorsal contractile
vacuoles with 2–3 excretory pores each. Extrusomes rod-shaped, about 7 μm long. On average 28 ciliary
rows, about 8 anteriorly differentiated into a staggered, distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with bristles
about 1.5 µm long. Oral bulge opening about 17 μm across. Preoral kineties strongly oblique, ordinarily
spaced, usually composed of 3 narrowly spaced kinetids.
Type locality: kahl (1931) did not specify any type locality, but referred to mosses from Zillertal, Austria
and the Yosemite Valley, California, USA. The neotype is from the upper soil layer in the surroundings of
the town of Thingvellier, SW Iceland, W21°10’ N64°15’. According to Article 76.3 of the ICZN (1999),
the place of origin of the neotype becomes the type locality of the nominal species-group taxon, despite
any previously published statement of the type locality.
Type material: No type material is available from kahl’s specimens. Foissner (1989) deposited two

Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective conspicuus refers to the conspicuous
habitus of the species.
Description: This species has been studied in several populations that match very well. Therefore, the
description summarizes all observations.
Size usually about 150 × 55 μm in vivo. Type specimens up to 200 μm long (kahl 1931), Icelandic
neotype individuals 140–180 × 40–70 μm (Foissner 1989), Bavarian cells 125–180 μm (wenzel 1953),
Slovak specimens 150–160 μm (tirJakoVá 2005). Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape dileptid to
narrowly dileptid, i.e., length:width ratio 2.8–4.1:1, on average 3.4:1 (Table 29). Proboscis very conspicuous
because occupying almost half of body length and distinctly rostrate, that is, comparatively stout, leaf-like
flattened, curved dorsally, and indistinctly set off from trunk providing cells with an Arcuospathidium-
like appearance. Trunk not flattened, ellipsoidal (Figs 59a–e, h–j, l). Typically two oblong macronuclear
nodules in centre of trunk; nodules slightly pyriform in Icelandic neotype specimens, about 27 × 10 μm
in size after protargol impregnation (Table 29); rarely four nodules (kahl 1931, wenzel 1953), a pattern
typical for reorganizing exconjugants (Fig. 59b); nucleoli globular and evenly distributed in nodules.
One or two micronuclei in between macronuclear nodules or near vertex formed by the abutting nodules,
4–6 μm across in vivo, while 2–5 μm in protargol preparations (Figs 59a–h, j, l; Table 29). Typically two
dorsal contractile vacuoles each with two to three intrakinetal pores: anterior vacuole at level of oral bulge
opening, posterior vacuole subterminal and surrounded by many small vacuoles in neotype cells (Figs
59a, b, d, e, h, j, l). Extrusomes studied only in Icelandic neotype population, inconspicuous, i.e., rod-
shaped and 7 μm long, arranged in several rows in proboscis oral bulge (Fig. 59f). Cortex very flexible,
colourless, contains about six oblique granule rows between adjacent kineties (Fig. 59g). Cytoplasm
colourless, hyaline in proboscis, opaque in trunk because packed with globular and irregular lipid droplets
2–15 μm across and about 12 μm-sized food vacuoles containing Leptopharynx costatus, rarely also
diatoms; in trunk end sometimes a defecation vacuole with granular contents. Cytopyge in posterior pole.
Swims slowly appearing awkward.
Cilia ordinarily to narrowly spaced, arranged in an average of 28 ordinarily spaced, meridional rows
following body curvature (Table 29). Right side rows gradually shortened along oral bulge; perioral kinety
extends to tip of proboscis with narrowly spaced basal bodies (Fig. 59i). Blank stripe on left side of
proboscis distinct, although some ciliary rows extend above proximal half of proboscis (Figs 59j, k).
Dorsal brush on dorsal and left side of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; composed of an
average of eight rows with loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids associated with 1–1.5 μm long bristles
(Fig. 59j; Table 29).
Oral bulge opening about 17 μm across in vivo. Pharyngeal basket obconical, well recognizable in vivo.
Oral bulge distinct due to the nice metachronal ciliary waves. Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly
spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening. About 50
strongly oblique, ordinarily spaced preoral kineties, as estimated from Fig. 59j, each composed of two to
four, usually three narrowly spaced kinetids, forming strongly oblique rows (Figs 59j, k).
Occurrence and ecology: Rimaleptus conspicuus is a rare species usually having low abundances.
Typically, it occurs in mosses and soil, rarely in limnetic habitats. As yet recorded only from two main
biogeographic regions: the Holarctic (both in Palearctic and Nearctic; e.g., kahl 1931; Patrick 1961;
Foissner 1989; tirJakoVá 1997a, 2005; tirJakoVá & stloukal 2004) and the Australis (Blatterer &
Foissner 1988), indicating that it might have restricted distribution.

redescription)
Generic affiliation, nomenclature and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus alpinus with Rimaleptus because
of the two macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. This species was established by kahl in
1931, not 1932 as frequently listed (Blatterer & Foissner 1988, Foissner 1996b, chrenkoVá & tirJakoVá
2000, tirJakoVá 1997a, tirJakoVá & stloukal 2004, BartoŠoVá & tirJakoVá 2008). Foissner (1989)
neotypified R. alpinus with a Bavarian population without providing the reasons. However, we support
neotypification because (i) the identity is endangered by several similar species, e.g., R. bivacuolatus, (ii)
no type material is available from kahl’s (1931) specimens, (iii) there are no doubts on identification, (iv)
the neotype is from the same biogeographic region and a similar habitat, and (v) the preparations have
sufficient quality.
Within the R. alpinus group, R. alpinus is outstanding in having long brush bristles (up to 7 μm vs.
2–3 μm), a feature originally mentioned by kahl (1931) and later confirmed in two other populations
(Foissner 1989, unpublished observations). Long to very long bristles occur also in R. longitrichus which,
however, differs from R. alpinus in body size (210 × 30 μm vs. 110 × 15 μm) and the contractile vacuole
pattern (multivacuolate vs. bivacuolate). Rimaleptus alpinus is most similar to R. binucleatus and R.
bivacuolatus. However, R. binucleatus is distinguished from R. alpinus by the larger size (300 μm vs.
110 μm on average) and the double number of ciliary rows (19–25 vs. 10–12). The South American R.
bivacuolatus differs from R. alpinus, at the present state of knowledge, only in the nuclear apparatus
(each macronuclear nodule with a laterally attached micronucleus vs. a single micronucleus in between
macronuclear nodules).

Im proved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 110 × 15 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
to cylindroidally dileptid with narrowly rounded posterior end, proboscis about 30% of body length.
Two oblong macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus in between. Two dorsal contractile vacuoles with
several excretory pores each. Two size-types (5–6 μm and 2.5–3 μm) of rod-shaped extrusomes attached
to proboscis oral bulge. On average 11 ciliary rows, 2 staggered and differentiated into an isostichad dorsal
brush with bristles up to 7 μm long. Oral bulge opening about 6 μm across. Preoral kineties oblique to
strongly oblique, ordinarily to narrowly spaced, usually composed of 2 narrowly spaced kinetids.
Type locality: kahl (1931) discovered D. alpinus in moss from the Brenner pass region, i.e., the border
of Austria and Italy in Tyrol, E11°30’ N46°59’. The neotype is from mosses of the Schönramer Filz close
to the towns of Salzburg, Austria and Freilassing, Bavaria, Germany, E12°59’ N47°51’ (Foissner 1989).
According to Article 76.3 of the ICZN (1999), the place of origin of the neotype becomes the type locality
of the nominal species-group taxon, despite any previously published statement of the type locality.
Type material: No type material is available from kahl’s specimens. Foissner (1989) deposited two
neotype slides (inv. nos 1988/6 and 1988/7) with protargol-impregnated Bavarian specimens in the
Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink
circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective alpinus refers to the Alps, where the
species was discovered.
Description: All data are put together because the morphological conspecificity of the populations
mentioned in the list of synonyms is beyond reasonable doubts. However, the review emphasizes the data
of Foissner (1989), who provided the most detailed description.

Size in vivo similar in various populations, usually about 110 × 15 μm. Type specimens 100–120 μm
long (kahl 1931), Bavarian cells 60–160 μm, on average 113 μm (wenzel 1953); Bavarian neotype
specimens 100 × 15 μm on average in protargol preparations (Foissner 1989; Table 30). Shape narrowly
to cylindroidally dileptid with a length:width ratio of an average of 7:1 after protargol impregnation (Table
30). Proboscis about 30% of body length, more or less distinctly curved dorsally; trunk oblong to bluntly
fusiform, posterior end narrowly rounded (Figs 60a–c, i, f; Table 30). Nuclear apparatus in centre of trunk.
Macronuclear nodules ellipsoidal to oblong, i.e., length:width ratio 2–4.5:1, on average 2.8:1, size about
13 × 5 μm in protargol preparations; nucleoli globular and evenly distributed. Micronucleus in between
macronuclear nodules, possibly close to nodule vertex in some specimens, 1.4–2 μm across in protargol
preparations (Figs 60a, c, i, f; Table 30). Contractile vacuole pattern very similar in all populations
investigated: anterior vacuole underneath level of oral bulge opening, posterior vacuole at beginning of
last fourth of trunk; number of excretory pores studied only in neotype specimens, i.e., each vacuole with
three pores one after the other right of the kinety bearing brush row 2; wenzel (1953) observed some
specimens with a pair of contractile vacuoles each in anterior and posterior portion of trunk (Figs 60a,
b, e, i, f). Extrusomes studied in two populations from The Netherlands and Finland (Figs 60g, h): type I
rod-like with very slightly narrowed ends in Finnish specimens, about 5–6 × 0.8 μm in size; type II present
only in Finnish cells, oblong and 2.5–3 μm long, possibly overlooked in the other populations. Cytoplasm
colourless and hyaline; sometimes a defecation vacuole with granular material in rear body end.
Cilia ordinarily spaced; arranged in an average of 11 ordinarily spaced, meridional rows anteriorly gradually
shortened along right side of oral bulge, except for perioral kinety which extends with comparatively
loosely spaced basal bodies to tip of proboscis (Figs 60b, d; Table 30). Both sides of proboscis with a blank
stripe, that on left side broader because some ciliary rows end at level of oral bulge opening (Figs 60b, c).
Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of two staggered, isostichad rows (Figs 60c,
e; Table 30). Brush bristles conspicuous because up to 7 µm long, as originally mentioned by kahl (1931)
in the description of Dileptus americanus, and later confirmed in the Bavarian neotype (Foissner 1989).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second third of body, about 6 µm across in protargol preparations,
projects indistinctly because base of proboscis almost as wide as trunk (Figs 60d, j; Table 30). Pharyngeal
basket bulbous, distinct both in vivo and after protargol impregnation (Figs 60a–d). Circumoral kinety
composed of loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids, except for narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral
bulge opening. About 25 oblique to strongly oblique, ordinarily to narrowly spaced preoral kineties, as
estimated from figures, each composed of two to three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 60c, d).
Occurrence and ecology: Rimaleptus alpinus is a moss and soil species that has been recorded in a
variety of terrestrial and semi-terrestrial habitats from all biogeographic regions (Foissner 1998). It is well
adapted to terrestrial habitats by the small and highly flexible body.
Records from the Holarctis: in moss from the Brenner pass region, Austrian Alps, 2500 m above sea level
(kahl 1931); in mosses, lichens, leaf and needle litter (pH 4.8–5.2) from the Erlangen area in Bavaria,
Germany (wenzel 1953); in mosses, litter and soil from various forests in Austria and Germany (Foissner
1989, 2000; aescht & Foissner 1993; Foissner et al. 2005); in very sandy soil and inland sand dunes from
Germany and The Netherlands (VerhoeVen 1999, 2001; Foissner & al-rasheiD 2007); in soil, mosses,
leaf litter, bark and decaying wood mass of various trees from several localities in Slovakia (tirJakoVá &
matis 1987; chrenkoVá & tirJakoVá 2000; BartoŠoVá & tirJakoVá 2005, 2008; tirJakoVá 2005); in a
shallow streamlet covered by leaves below the Veľký Javorník (Little Carpathian Mts.) in the vicinity of
the town of Bratislava, Slovakia (tirJakoVá 1997a, tirJakoVá & stloukal 2004); lakes around Mt. Fuji,
Japan (suDzuki 1971); Canadian grassland (Bick & BuitkamP 1976).
Records from the Australis and the Paleo- and Neotropis: in 10 out of 21 sites investigated in Australia

(Blatterer & Foissner 1988); in humic brown soil (pH 5.1) from a floodplain primary (?) forest on one
of the many small islands in the Rio Amazonas, about 20 km east of Manaus, Janauari region, Brazil
(Foissner 1997b); in leaf litter and soil from three sites in the Shimba Hills Nature Reserve, Kenya,
equatorial Africa (Foissner 1999).
Records from Antarctica and islands in the southern oceans: in the grass sward of a sheltered, north-
facing slope on Signy Island, and in moss (Drepanocladus uncinatus) from Sealer Hill, Byers Peninsula,
Livingstone Island (Foissner 1996b).

1931 Dileptus bivacuolatus da cunha, 1913 – kahl, Tierwelt Dtl. 21: 207 (first taxonomic reviser)
1959 Dileptus bivacuolatus Da cunha 1915 – VuXanoVici, Studii Cerc. Biol. 11: 328 (misdated, very likely a
misidentification)

misidentification)
1963 Dileptus bivacuolatus Da cunha, 1913 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 117 (second taxonomic reviser)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus bivacuolatus with Rimaleptus because of the
two macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Full redescription is required because important
features have not been described. Rimaleptus bivacuolatus is almost unique in having a micronucleus each
attached laterally to the macronuclear nodules. All congeners, except for R. nistroviensis, have a single
micronucleus between the macronuclear nodules. Rimaleptus nistroviensis differs from R. bivacuolatus
by the symbiotic green algae and the contractile vacuole pattern (a subterminal vacuole vs. two dorsal
vacuoles).
We doubt the observations of da cunha (1913) because he did not stain the nucleus. Indeed, if one
assumes an ordinary nuclear pattern, this species would be a senior synonym of R. alpinus. As concerns
VuXanoVici’s (1959) and moraVcoVá’s (1962) populations, they very likely represent another species
each. The Roumanian specimen is much larger (380 μm vs. up to 150 μm) and has a narrower and longer
proboscis (Fig. 60n), while the Czech cell has a ventral and a dorsal contractile vacuole (vs. two dorsal
vacuoles, cp. Fig. 60o with Figs 60k–m). Further, neither VuXanoVici (1959) nor moraVcoVá (1962)
described the micronuclei, a key feature of R. bivacuolatus. Therefore, their observations are not included
in the diagnosis and description.
Diagnosis (based on Brazilian populations): Size about 125 × 25 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid
with acute posterior end, proboscis about 1/4 of body length. Two ellipsoidal, abutting macronuclear
nodules and a micronucleus each attached laterally to macronuclear nodules. Two contractile vacuoles in
dorsal side of trunk.
Type locality: Da cunha (1913) did not specify the type locality and habitat. However, the Rio de Janeiro
area can be assumed to be the type locality, and the habitat was very likely freshwater, which da cunha
studied most of his life.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Latin numeral bi (two) and the noun
vacuola, referring to the two contractile vacuoles.
Description (according to the Brazilian populations): Size 100–150 × 20–30 μm in vivo. Shape very
narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of about 5.5:1, according to the figure provided (Fig. 60l).

Proboscis comparatively massive, occupies about one fourth of body length, slightly set off from bluntly
fusiform trunk; posterior body region gradually narrowed to an acute end. Nuclear apparatus as described
in the diagnosis. Two dorsal contractile vacuoles: anterior vacuole at first quarter of trunk, posterior vacuole
at beginning of last quarter. Extrusomes not described but shown as fine rods attached to proboscis oral
bulge and scattered throughout cytoplasm. About five meridionally arranged ciliary rows on one side of
cell, according to Fig. 60l.
Occurrence and ecology: Da cunha (1913) found R. bivacuolatus at several Brazilian localities:
Manguinhos and Gavea in the town of Rio de Janeiro, Merity in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and Boituva
in the state of São Paulo. Later, unsubstantiated records: possibly in a culture from a polluted river in the
Czech Republic (moraVcoVá 1962); in “macchia” soil from Italy (luzzatti 1938); a single specimen in a
water sample from Lake Tei in the town of Bucharest, Roumania in November 1957 (VuXanoVici 1959);
in the plankton of the Tisa River in Ukraine (koValchuk 1997b); 6–7 ind./l in fishless, intermittent ponds
in Vandorf, Ontario, Canada (anDrushchyshyn et al. 2006); freshwater bodies in the Pantanal of Mato
Grosso, Brazil (loPes harDoim & heckman 1996).

mid-portion, inflated in well-fed specimens (Fig. 61l); posterior end narrowly rounded, never tail-like
(Figs 61a, h, j, m–q). Nuclear apparatus in mid or slightly above mid of trunk. Invariably two abutting
macronuclear nodules, indidivual nodules narrowly to very narrowly ellipsoidal, more or less curved,
homogenously impregnated with protargol, on average 20 × 5 μm in size. Micronucleus very near to or in
vertex formed by the abutting macronuclear nodules, blister-like and hyaline, about 5 μm across in vivo,
while deeply impregnated and only 2.5 μm across in protargol preparations (Figs 61a, h–j, r, t; Table 31).
Invariably two dorsal contractile vacuoles each with usually two intrakinetal pores one after the other:
anterior vacuole at end of first fourth of trunk, posterior one at beginning of last fourth (Figs 61a, k–r).
Two types of compact extrusomes not impregnating with protargol and scattered throughout cytoplasm:
type I attached to furrow separating bulge branches and scattered in oral bulge opening, bluntly oblong
with minute anterior dome, 3 × 1 μm in size; type II anchored in both bulge branches and scattered in
oral bulge opening, slenderly oblong with rounded ends, 3–4 × 0.2–0.3 μm in size, when exploded with a
clavate granule at tip of tube emerging from the empty capsule (Figs 61a, d–f, u–y). Cortex very flexible,
contains about six oblique granule rows between adjacent kineties; granules conspicuous because highly
refractive and narrowly spaced in somatic and oral cortex, about 0.2 μm across in surface view (Figs 61g,
s). Cytoplasm colourless, turbid due to numerous granules ~ 0.2 μm across, some lipid droplets 2–8 μm in
diameter, and 10 μm-sized food vacuoles (Figs 61a, r).
Cilia about 6 μm long in vivo, ordinarily to loosely spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids;
arranged in an average of 13 ordinarily spaced, longitudinal rows anteriorly gradually shortened along
right side of oral bulge, except for perioral kinety which extends with ordinarily spaced basal bodies to
tip of proboscis (Fig. 61h; Table 31). Left side of proboscis with conspicuous blank stripe because some
ciliary rows end at level of oral bulge opening (Fig. 61j). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis,
composed of two dimorphic, staggered, isostichad rows: row 1 commences slightly more subapically
than row 2, composed of an average of 10 loosely spaced dikinetids; row 2 begins near tip of proboscis,
composed of an average of 18 ordinarily spaced dikinetids. Brush dikinetids associated with type II
bristles both being 2–3 μm long. Both brush rows continue with a monokinetidal tail extending to base of
proboscis with 1 μm long type VI bristles (Figs 61a, b, j, k).
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body quarter, about 10 μm across in vivo, projects ordinarily (Figs
61a, e, l, m, o, q, s; Table 31). Pharyngeal basket short, internal basket distinctly bulbous both in vivo and
after protargol impregnation (Figs 61c, j). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced dikinetids,
except for narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening (Figs 61h, j). Preoral kineties
conspicuous because widely spaced and composed of four to nine, usually six narrowly spaced kinetids,
thus forming rather long, strongly oblique rows almost in parallel to circumoral kinety in anterior third of
proboscis (Fig. 61j).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i.e., in a mixture of bark (pH 5.0) from
Mountain hemlock trees (Tsuga mertensiana) and Amabilis fir trees (Abies amabilis).
Remarks: Within the Rimaleptus alpinus group, R. canadensis is outstanding in having extrusomes
anchored to both the proboscis oral bulge and the oral bulge opening, while all congeners have extrusomes
only in the proboscis. In this respect, R. canadensis resembles the multinucleate Dileptus costaricanus
and Pseudomonilicaryon falciforme, a species with moniliform macronucleus. Other rare features, present
only in Rimaleptus tirjakovae, are the blister-like micronucleus and its localization in the vertex formed
by the abutting macronuclear nodules. However, R. tirjakovae is easily distinguished by the contractile
vacuole pattern (a dorsal stripe vs. two dorsal vacuoles), the type I extrusomes (rod-shaped vs. bluntly
oblong with minute, anterior dome), and the much higher number of ciliary rows (21 vs. 13). There are
several similar bivacuolate congeners, viz., R. alpinus, R. armatus, R. binucleatus and R. bivacuolatus.

The three former species have rod-shaped or narrowly ovate extrusomes (vs. oblong and massive) and
preoral kineties composed of 2–3 (vs. 4–9) basal bodies. Rimaleptus bivacuolatus differs by the nuclear
apparatus, i.e., each macronuclear nodule has attached a micronucleus (vs. a single micronucleus in the
nodule vertex).
Rimaleptus armatus (FoissnEr & schadE in FoissnEr, 2000) nov. comb. (Figs 62a–w, 63a–o,
64a–v; Table 32)
2000 Dileptus armatus Foissner & schaDe nov. sp. – Foissner, Eur. J. Protistol. 36: 265
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus armatus with Rimaleptus because of the two
macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Within the R. alpinus group, R. armatus is most
similar to R. canadensis in having comparatively massive type I extrusomes. However, these are narrowly
ovate and attached only to the proboscis oral bulge in the former, while bluntly oblong with a minute dome
and anchored in both the proboscis oral bulge and the oral bulge opening in the latter.
Improved diagnosis (includes 3 populations): Size about 175 × 25 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly
dileptid with posterior end narrowly rounded, proboscis approximately 1/4 of body length. Two oblong
macronuclear nodules with a single micronucleus in between. Two contractile vacuoles with several pores
each in dorsal side of trunk. Two types of extrusomes: type I narrowly ovate, 3–6 × 1–2 μm in size; type
II rod-shaped, 3 μm long. Usually about 12 ciliary rows, 2 anteriorly differentiated into an isostichad
dorsal brush with bristles up to 4 μm long: brush rows 1 and 2 composed of an average of 14 and 15
dikinetids, respectively; both rows with a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to base of proboscis. Oral
bulge opening ovate, about 12 × 7 μm in size. On average 18 oblique to strongly oblique, widely spaced
preoral kineties, each usually composed of 2–3 narrowly to ordinarily spaced cilia.
Type locality: Soil from Helgoland (Oberland), Germany, E7°53’ N54°12’.
Type and voucher material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2000/114) and three paratype slides (inv.
nos 2000/115–117) as well as fifteen voucher slides (Japanese population; inv. nos 2011/285–300) with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper
Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective armatus (armed) refers to the thick extrusomes.
Description: This species has been studied in three populations, namely from Helgoland (type) and Berlin
(both Germany), and from Japan. The populations match very well, therefore the diagnosis summarizes
all observations. The description of the Helgoland population is followed by some additional data from
the other populations.
Size 140–250 × 20–40 μm in vivo, on average about 200 × 30 μm; flexible but not contractile. Shape
narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with an average length:width ratio of 7.4:1 in protargol preparations
(Table 32). Proboscis leaf-like flattened, occupying about one fourth of body length; trunk cylindroidal
with posterior end narrowly rounded, rarely bluntly pointed but never tail-like (Figs 62b, i, j, n, q–w).
Nuclear apparatus in centre of trunk. Macronuclear nodules ellipsoidal to narrowly ellipsoidal or
ovoidal, sometimes curved, with concave proximal end surrounding micronucleus; many small nucleoli.
Micronucleus invariably between macronuclear nodules, about 4 × 3 μm in vivo (Figs 62b, n, 63a, b;
Table 32). A contractile vacuole each in anterior and posterior quarter of trunk, each vacuole with one
to six, usually three intrakinetal pores one after the other (Figs 62b, o, j, o, q–w, 63a, b). Two types of
extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge and scattered throughout cytoplasm: type I sparse (about 15
organelles attached to proboscis) but conspicuous because highly refractive, narrowly ovate and 4–6 × 1–2
μm in size, impregnates lightly with protargol; type II numerous but inconspicuous because rod-shaped

and robust, cells thus withstand even strong coverslip pressure; contains innumerable, highly refractive,
about 0.8 × 0.3 μm-sized granules forming six to nine narrowly spaced rows between adjacent kineties, do
not impregnate with protargol (Figs 62k, 63c). Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to many lipid droplets

surface and soil particles or swims slowly, moving proboscis to and fro.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily to densely spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for
dileptids, i.e., with a distinctly inflated and deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles (Figs
62l, p); arranged in an average of 14 ordinarily spaced, longitudinal rows anteriorly gradually shortened
along right side of oral bulge, except for perioral kinety extending to tip of proboscis (Figs 62n, o; Table
32). Left side of proboscis with wide blank stripe because ciliary rows end at level of oral bulge opening
(Figs 62m, p). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of two staggered, isostichad
rows with a similar number of dikinetids associated with 2–3 μm long type II bristles. Both brush rows
continue to base of proboscis with a monokinetidal tail of about 1.5 μm long type VI bristles (Figs 62a, b,
o, p; Table 32).
Oral bulge opening in anterior body third, about 12 × 7 μm in size after protargol impregnation (Table

spaced, strongly oblique, composed of two to four, usually three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 62m, n).
Observations on Japanese and Berlin populations: The Japanese population matches the type in all main
features (Figs 64a–v; Table 32). As usual, some details differ: (i) body slightly smaller (120–190 × 20–30
μm vs. 140–250 × 20–40 μm); (ii) macronuclear nodules ranging from broadly to narrowly ellipsoidal; (iii)
micronucleus surrounded by a membrane after protargol impregnation (vs. without distinct membrane);
(iii) type I extrusomes shorter (3 μm vs. 4–6 μm); (iv) number of ciliary rows inconspicuously lower (on
average 12 vs. 14); (v) brush bristles slightly longer (up to 4 μm vs. up to 3 μm). The Berlin population,
which was also studied in detail, is very similar to the type population, except for some morphometrics
(Figs 62e–h, i, j, p, q–w; Table 32).
Occurrence and ecology: There are several records of Rimaleptus armatus from Europe, Asia and the
Indic Ocean. Foissner (2000) found R. armatus at three sites in Germany (litter and soil from the upper
5 cm of a beech forest about 30 km NW of the town of Kassel; artificial sand soil from sewage irrigation
fields in the surroundings of the towns of Berlin-Buch and Ruhlsdorf, Brandenburg, pH 4.8–6.5), in Austria
(riparian forest soil from the River Enns in Upper Austria), and on the Maldives (highly saline litter under
coastal shrubs from Little Bandos, North Male Atol, pH 7.7; collected by Dr. W. Petz on 15. 12. 1990).

Foissner et al. (2005) reported R. armatus in seven out of 12 natural forest stands investigated in Lower
Austria. The new population described here, is from the surroundings of the town of Tsukuba, Japan (soil
and litter from the upper 3 cm of an abandoned field covered with up to 1 m high plants, pH 5.5). Thus, R.
armatus is a euryhaline and likely cosmopolitan ciliate.

type species of the genus Rimaleptus. At first glance, D. binucleatus highly resembles D. americanus.
According to kahl (1931), they differ by the body size (300–400 µm vs. 190–220 µm) and shape (only
slightly curved proboscis and acute posterior end vs. distinctly curved proboscis and rounded posterior
end). However, our observations on populations from Slovakia (identified as D. americanus by Vďačný et
al. 2006) and Australia (unpubl.) show transitions in body size (180–400 µm in the former and 170–250
µm in the latter) and shape (proboscis slightly to distinctly curved and posterior end acute to rounded) as
well as in the shape of the macronuclear nodules (curved oblong to reniform). Both populations match
very well, especially in proboscis length, the shape and size of the extrusomes as well as the number of
ciliary rows (Figs 65a, 67i; Table 33).
As D. binucleatus and D. americanus were established in the same year and work by kahl (1931), the
Principle of the First Reviser applies (Article 24.2.2. of the ICZN 1999). We propose D. americanus as a
junior synonym of D. binucleatus herein. Our decision is also supported in that D. binucleatus is the type
species of the genus Rimaleptus.
Dragesco (1963) misidentified a French population with two ventral and three dorsal contractile vacuoles
as Dileptus americanus (Fig. 67j). In this respect, Dragesco’s specimens resemble Rimaleptus longitrichus
which, however, has very long brush bristles (up to 15 μm vs. inconspicuous and short). Since there are no
other Rimaleptus with ventral contractile vacuoles, Dragesco’s population very likely represents a distinct
species.
Rimaleptus binucleatus belongs to the R. alpinus group, where it is most similar to R. alpinus and R.
bivacuolatus in having fine, rod-shaped extrusomes. However, R. binucleatus is easily distinguished by
the larger size (250 μm vs. 110 μm on average) and the double number of the ciliary rows (19–25 vs.
10–12).
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 250 × 35 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
to cylindroidally dileptid with acute or rounded posterior body end, proboscis about 35% of body length.

on average 7:1 in protargol preparations (Table 33). Proboscis about 35% of body length, usually curved
dorsally; trunk bluntly fusiform, unflattened, posterior end acute to rounded, never tail-like (Figs 65b–d,
h–l, 66a, 67a–g, m, n; Table 33). Nuclear apparatus in centre or slightly above mid of trunk. Invariably two
macronuclear nodules in blunt to sharp angles; individual nodules reniform, oblong or cylindroidal and
usually curved, some helical in Australian population; size about 32 × 7 μm after protargol impregnation;
length:width ratio 3.3–7.6:1, on average 5.5:1; nucleoli 1–2 µm across, evenly distributed. Micronucleus
in between macronuclear nodules, about 4.5 μm across in protargol preparations; sometimes surrounded
by a distinct membrane in Australian specimens (Figs 65b, c, h–l, 66a, 67a–g, n; Table 33). Invariably
two dorsal contractile vacuoles each with an intrakinetal pore: anterior vacuole slightly posterior to level
of oral bulge opening, posterior vacuole at beginning of last quarter of trunk (Figs 65b–d, j, 67a–c, n).
Extrusomes studied in Slovak and Australian specimens, their shape and size fairly similar (Figs 65a,
67i): type I rod-like with slightly narrowed ends, 5–7 μm long in Slovak specimens and about 6 × 0.8 μm
in Australian cells; type II very fine, oblong and approximately 2 μm long. Cortex very flexible, contains
five to six (Slovak specimens; Fig. 67h) or about 10 (Australian cells) rows of colourless granules between
two adjacent kineties. Cytoplasm colourless, packed with lipid droplets 1–10 µm across and food vacuoles
containing remnants of medium to large-sized prey ciliates. Glides rather slowly (Slovak specimens) to
rapidly (Australian cells) on microscope slide, curving proboscis to and fro.
Cilia 7–8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily to narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids,
i.e., 5.5 μm long and with thick, deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal and tail bristles (Fig.
67m). Ciliary rows ordinarily spaced, extend meridionally, number fairly stable between populations,
viz., 19–25, on average 21 in Slovak specimens and 18–24, on average 20 in Australian cells (Table 33).
A blank stripe on both sides of proboscis (Figs 65e–g, 66e–g, 67m, n). First row right of circumoral kinety
extends as perioral kinety with ordinarily spaced cilia to tip of proboscis (Figs 65e, 67m). Dorsal brush a
long, narrow field on dorsal side of proboscis; composed of four to six staggered, distinctly heterostichad
rows, appearing diffuse when seen laterally; Australian specimens often with some irregularities, such as
breaks or some extra dikinetids forming a short additional row (Figs 65g, f, 66e–g, 67n; Table 33). Brush
dikinetids loosely to ordinarily spaced and associated with slightly clavate bristles up to 3 µm long in vivo
in Australian specimens and 1.8 μm long after protargol impregnation in Slovak cells.
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second third of body, projects slightly to distinctly, roundish both
in vivo and after protargol impregnation, in Slovak cells possibly sometimes ovate (Figs 65b–d, h–l,
67a–g; Table 33). Pharyngeal basket up to 20 μm long, indistinct in vivo. Circumoral kinety composed of
narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening.
About 50 oblique, ordinarily spaced preoral kineties, as estimated from figures, each usually composed of
two (Australian specimens) or three (Slovak cells) narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 65f, 66d, f, 67n).
Occurrence and ecology: Rimaleptus binucleatus is a moss and soil species, possibly also occurring in
limnetic habitats. This species and its synonym have been reliably recorded from the Holarctis, Paleotropis
and Australis, indicating cosmopolitan distribution.
Locus classicus of R. binucleatus are mosses on limestones from the Mittenwald region, Germany (kahl
1931). In Australia, R. binucleatus occurred in a litter and soil sample (pH 5.2) from the rainforest near
the town of Cairns. There are several unsubstantiated records: forest mosses from Slovenský raj (Slovak
Paradise), Slovakia (tirJakoVá & matis 1987); in various soils from Abaco Island, Bahamas (cairns &
ruthVen 1972); lightly burnt soil in New Zealand (stout 1961); Manzanares River near Madrid, Spain
(FernánDez-leBorans & noVillo 1995); coastal benthos of the Black Sea (DetcheVa 1980, 1992; azoVsky
& mazei 2003); Volga river basin, Russia (zhukoV et al. 1998); sometimes abundant in a polluted river in
Delhi, India (kaur & mehra 2001); Mountain Lake region, Giles County, Virginia, USA (BoVee 1960).

Terrestrial records of the synonym Dileptus americanus: 12 specimens in mosses from Wisconsin, USA,
and in roof mosses from the town of Hamburg, Germany (kahl 1931); leaf litter and soil of a beech
forest on the “Kleinen Gudenberg” near Zierenberg, a small town about 30 km NW of the town of Kassel,
Germany (Foissner 2000); calcaric fluvisol covered by mosses from the town of Bratislava, Slovakia
(chrenkoVá & tirJakoVá 2000); leaf litter (pH 4.5) from a beach forest in Vršatecké Bradlá-reef, Biele
Karpaty Mts., Slovakia, 650 m above sea level (Vďačný et al. 2006); forest soil in Hungary (gellért
1957); Thar desert, India (Das 1996); mangrove ecosystem in India (nanDi et al. 1993); in a mixture of
plant litter, grass roots, and very sandy, humous soil from the Namib desert (Foissner et al. 2002); tussock
grassland soils in New Zealand (stout 1958).
Unsubstantiated limnetic records of the synonym D. americanus: in a eutrophic lake in England (weBB
1961); Llobregat River in Barcelona, Spain (gracia et al. 1989); freshwater bodies on Mount Desert
Island, Nebraska, USA (mccashlanD 1956); in Nichol’s Bog at 18.5–20 ºC and pH 6.0 and in the West
Branch of the Maple River, Michigan, USA (cairns & yongue 1966); in several water bodies of the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan, USA (lunDin & west 1963; possibly a misidentification according to the figure
provided, Fig. 67o); in the benthos of the slightly to moderately polluted Cape Fear River in the vicinity
of Fayetteville, North Carolina, USA (cairns & yongue 1973); Mexico (maDrazo-gariBay & lóPez-
ochoterena 1973, alaDro-luBel et al. 2006).
The Rimaleptus mucronatus group
The six species collected in this group share multiple contractile vacuoles. Their extrusomes and dorsal
brush are rather similar, but the length of the proboscis is rather different. Further, some species display
curious specialities making their identification easy and reliable. For instance, R. tirjakovae has globular
macronuclear nodules, while R. longitrichus possesses very long brush bristles (Table 34).

Rimaleptus brasiliensis nov. sp. (Figs 68a–m; Table 35)
2002 Dileptus breviproboscis Foissner, 1981 – Foissner, agatha & Berger, Denisia 5: 367 (misidentification)
Nomenclature and taxonomy: Foissner et al. (2002) misidentified the Brazilian site (30) population as
Dileptus breviproboscis but mentioned that it could be considered as a new species, which is established
here as Rimaleptus brasiliensis with the specimen shown in Figs 68h, j as the holotype. This is in accordance
with Articles 49 and 72.3 of the ICZN (1999).
For details on taxonomy, see Microdileptus breviproboscis. Possibly, R. brasiliensis belongs to
Microdileptus; however, the oral bulge opening is too large (9 × 5 µm).
Diagnosis: Size about 160 × 18 µm in vivo. Shape cylindroidally dileptid with acute posterior third,
proboscis about 22% of body length. Two oblong macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus in between.
A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles with 1–2 pores each. Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis
oral bulge: type I bluntly oblong with conical anterior end or ovate, 2–3 × 1 µm in size; type II fine, 3–4
µm long rods. On average 10 ciliary rows, 2 staggered and differentiated into an isostichad dorsal brush
with bristles up to 4 µm long; both rows with a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to anterior trunk
region. Oral bulge opening on average 9 × 5 µm in size. Preoral kineties ordinarily to widely spaced,
each usually composed of 2 narrowly spaced kinetids, forming minute oblique rows in proximal half of
proboscis, while almost a row in distal half.
Type locality: Rain forest soil from a small island in the Amazon River, Brazil, about 20 km east of the
town Manaus, Janauari region, W60° S4°.
Type material: Foissner et al. (2002) deposited five slides (inv. nos 2002/781–785) with protargol-
impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI), but under the
name Dileptus anguillula (aescht 2008). We declare the specimen shown in Figs 68h, j as the holotype
of R. brasiliensis. This specimen and several paratype specimens are marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip.
By an unfortunate mistake, the five slides were designated as neotypes in Table 1 (p. 38) of Foissner et al.
(2002). We declare this as a mistake which is also recognizable from the fact that “neotypification” is not
mentioned in the redescription of the species (Foissner et al. 2002: 367).
Etymology: The Latin adjective brasiliensis refers to the country (Brazil) in which the species was
discovered.
Description: Size in vivo 120–220 × 15–25 μm, usually near 160 × 18 μm. Shape very narrowly dileptid to
rod-like, length:width ratio highly variable, viz., 7–14:1, on average 9.5:1 in protargol preparations (Table
35). Proboscis indistinct because hardly set off from trunk and occupying only 22% of body length on
average. Trunk oblong to bluntly fusiform, not or only slightly flattened, posterior end narrowly rounded
(Figs 68a, g, h, j–m; Table 35). Nuclear apparatus in middle third of cell, invariably composed of two
macronuclear nodules with a globular to slightly ellipsoidal micronucleus in between; rarely specimens,
likely reorganizers, with two macronuclear groups each composed of four to six globular nodules;
macronuclear nodules ellipsoidal to conspicuously spiral; nucleoli globular to irregularly lobate (Figs 68a,
g, j, k, m; Table 35). A row of contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk, composed of three to six, usually
four small vacuoles each with one to two intrakinetal excretory pores associated with the brush kineties;
occasionally, a pair of contractile vacuoles each at anterior and posterior end of trunk (Figs 68a, g, h, m;
Table 35). Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge: type I only in broader right branch
of bulge, conspicuously thick, oblong in Brazilian site (28) specimens, while ovate to oblong with conical
anterior end in Brazilian site (30) individuals, about 2–3 × 1 μm in size; type II in both bulge branches,
more numerous than type I and also scattered throughout cytoplasm, fine, rod-shaped, about 3–4 × ≤ 0.5

μm (Figs 68b–d, f, g). Cortex very flexible, contains rows of colourless granules about 0.3 μm across (Fig.
68e). Cytoplasm colourless, contains many 0.5–5 μm-sized lipid droplets and food vacuoles with compact
or loose contents up to 7 μm in diameter; in rear end sometimes a defecation vacuole. Swims and glides
rather rapidly, showing great flexibility among soil particles.
Cilia 7–8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily to loosely spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids,
i.e., with thick and deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal and tail bristles; somatic basal bodies
associated with conspicuous (postciliary?) fibres obliquely extending backwards on right side of kineties

ordinarily to widely spaced cilia to tip of proboscis (Fig. 68j). A comparatively broad, blank stripe on
both sides of proboscis (Figs 68h–j). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of two
staggered, isostichad rows. Brush dikinetids widely to ordinarily spaced and associated with clavate, about
4 μm long bristles anteriorly, decreasing to 2 μm posteriorly. Both brush rows extend underneath level of
oral bulge opening with a tail of 1–2 µm long, monokinetidal bristles (Figs 68g–i, m).
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body fifth, projects only slightly because base of proboscis almost as
wide as trunk, ovate and about 9 × 5 μm in size after protargol impregnation (Figs 68a, f, g, i–l; Table 35).
Pharyngeal basket bulbous, without specific features. Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced
dikinetids, except for narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening (Figs 68i, j). Preoral
kineties ordinarily spaced, each composed of only two narrowly spaced cilia, difficult to recognize in
distal half of proboscis because arranged almost in parallel with circumoral kinety (Fig. 68i).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at type locality and a site nearby.

Generic affiliation, nomenclature and taxonomy: Vďačný et al. (2011b) combined Dileptus mucronatus
with Rimaleptus because of the two macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Misspelled as
“Dileptus micronatus” by shawhan et al. (1947), and thus unavailable according to Articles 33.3 and 33.5
of the ICZN (1999).
Neotypification was not mentioned by Foissner (1984) but one slide was designated as “paratype” (aescht
2008). We declare this slide as a neotype of Rimaleptus mucronatus. Neotypification is necessary because
(i) no type material is available from PenarD’s (1922) specimens, (ii) R. mucronatus possibly consists of
several cryptic species, (iii) of several similar species threatining its identity, (iv) there are no doubts on
the identification, (v) the neotype is from the same biogeographic region and a similar habitat, and (vi) the
preparations are of good quality.
The identity of the Chinese population is questionable because it has only three dorsal brush rows and
fewer ciliary rows. However, song (1994a, b) and song & wilBert (1989) described only three brush
rows in all dileptids they investigated, even in the large ones. Thus, we doubt their observations.

Figs 71g–p: Rimaleptus mucronatus, extrusomes (g–l) and resting cysts (m–p) in vivo (from Foissner et al. 2002).
g–l – large (6–7 × 0.9 µm; g–k) and small (3 µm; k, l) extrusomes of a single specimen from Zanzibar. The shape
of the large extrusomes varies from rod-like (g) to slightly ovate (k); m–p – resting cysts of Kenyan specimens.
The cysts are spherical to slightly ellipsoidal, have an average size of 60 µm, and are surrounded by a conspicuous
mucous layer. Arrow in (n) marks extruded cyst material, opposed arrowheads in (p) delimit the honey-brown,
smooth cyst wall. Scale bars 50 µm (m–p).
Rimaleptus mucronatus is easily identified by the moderate size (usually about 350 μm), the cylindroidally
dileptid body with a distinct tail, and the dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles. Within the R. mucronatus
group, R. mucronatus most resembles R. similis and R. longitrichus. However, R. similis is smaller (250 μm
vs. 350 μm) and has a rounded posterior end (vs. with distinct tail). Rimaleptus longitrichus is distinguished
from R. mucronatus by the smaller body (210 μm vs. 350 μm), the contractile vacuole pattern (ventral and
dorsal vacuoles vs. only dorsal ones), and the length of the brush bristles (up to 15 μm vs. 2–3 μm).
Foissner et al. (2002) studied extrusome shape and size in nine populations collected globally. They
were fairly constant, i.e., 5–8 µm long and rod-shaped to slightly ovate in eight populations (Figs 70d–f,
h–l, 71g–l), while very narrowly ovate in a population from Kenya (Fig. 70g). At the present state
of knowledge, we cannot decide whether the Kenyan population II represents a distinct taxon or the
extrusomes are considerably variable in R. mucronatus. Possibly, populations with very narrowly ovate
extrusomes should be given subspecies rank.
Improved diagnosis (excludes Kenyan population II): Size about 350 × 40 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
dileptid to rod-like with distinct tail, proboscis about 1/3 of body length. Two oblong macronuclear nodules
with a micronucleus in between. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles with 1–3 excretory pores each. Two
types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge: type I rod-shaped to slightly ovate, usually 6–7 × 0.9

bulge. B – dorsal brush, CK – circumoral kinety, OB – oral bulge, OO – oral bulge opening, PE – perioral kinety,

spaced cilia.
Type locality: PenarD (1922) discovered R. mucronatus in a drain in the surroundings (Pinchat) of the town
of Geneva, Switzerland, E6°9’ N46°10’. The neotype is from soil of a meadow near the Neusiedlersee,
a soda lake in the “hell” region near Illmitz, Burgenland, Austria E16°49’ N47°45’ (Foissner 1984).
According to Article 76.3 of the ICZN (1999), the place of origin of the neotype becomes the type locality
of the nominal species-group taxon, despite any previously published statement of the type locality.
Type and voucher material: No type material is available from PenarD’. Foissner (1984) deposited one
neotype slide (inv. no. 1984/34; mislabelled as “paratype”) with protargol-impregnated Austrian specimens
in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Foissner et al. (2002) deposited two
voucher slides (inv. nos 2002/568 and 2002/569) with protargol-impregnated Zanzibar specimens in the
same repository. Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Gene sequence: The 18S rRNA gene sequence of a North American population has been deposited in
GenBank (HM581675). The sequence is 1639 nucleotides long and has a GC content of 42.5%. It is a
consensus sequence based on 15 clones.

Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective mucronatus (sharply pointed, mucronate)
refers to the distinct tail.
Description: All data are put together because the morphological conspecificity of the populations
mentioned in the list of synonyms is beyond reasonable doubts, except for song’s (1994a) specimens.
Size highly variable in vivo, i.e., 240–550 µm long, usually about 350 × 40 μm. Type specimens 240–275
μm long (PenarD 1922), French cells 240 μm (Dragesco 1960), Austrian individuals 300–500 × 40–60
μm in size (Foissner 1984), Chinese exemplars 350–550 μm (song 1994a), and Zanzibar cells 250–500
μm long (Foissner et al. 2002). Australian specimens considerably smaller, i.e., 150–210 × 20–25 μm in
protargol preparations (Blatterer & Foissner 1988).
Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape in vivo narrowly dileptid to rod-like, i.e., length:width ratio
5.0–13:1, on average 7:1, according to the figures available and the morphometric data. Proboscis length
highly variable, viz., 20% to 41% of body length, on average about 33%, motile and flexible, anterior
portion usually curved dorsally (Table 36). Trunk oblong to bluntly fusiform, unflattened, indented in
mid portion in type specimen (Fig. 69a). Posterior end with distinct tail in vivo, while usually gradually
narrowing to an acute end in protargol and SEM prepared cells (Figs 69a–c, l, o, p, 70b, c, n, 71a, 72a,
b).
Nuclear apparatus in centre of trunk. Typically two macronuclear nodules, rarely specimens (post-dividers
or reorganizers?) with nodules fused into a rod-like structure or an ellipsoidal mass (Figs 69a–g, l, o, p,
70b, c, n, 71d, e; Table 36). Individual nodules oblong to cylindroidal, curved and/or spiralized; size after
protargol impregnation conspicuously variable within and between populations, viz., 42–70 × 6–9 μm,
on average 53.6 × 7.5 μm in Austrian specimens (Foissner 1984), while 29–48 × 7–11 μm, on average
33.8 × 9.1 μm in Zanzibar population (Foissner et al. 2002); length:width ratio also highly variable, i.e.,
3–10:1, on average 5.5:1. Nucleoli evenly distributed in macronuclear nodules, medium-sized, globular,
and well recognizable after protargol and silver carbonate impregnation (Figs 71d, e). Invariably a single
micronucleus between macronuclear nodules, about 3 μm across after protargol impregnation (Table 36).
Contractile vacuole pattern very similar in all populations investigated, viz., a dorsal stripe of at least four
vacuoles (Figs 69a–c, l, o, 70n). First vacuole at level of oral bulge opening in Swiss specimens (Fig.
69a), while near mid of proboscis in Austrian, Chinese and Zanzibar cells (Figs 69l, o, 70a, n). Number
of vacuoles: four to five in Swiss specimens (PenarD 1922), about six in Austrian and Zanzibar cells
(Foissner 1984, Foissner et al. 2002), and six to nine in Chinese individuals (song 1994a). Number of
excretory pores studied only in Austrian (Foissner 1984) and Kenyan (Foissner et al. 2002) specimens,
viz., one to three intrakinetal pores per vacuole (Figs 70a, 72b, i).
Extrusomes studied in 11 populations (see also taxonomic section above and Figs 69k, n, 70d–l, 71g–l).
Located in both branches of proboscis oral bulge (in an Austrian and Zanzibar population each) or
only in right branch (Venezuelan population). Type I extrusomes “court et serrés” in type specimens
(PenarD 1922); rod-shaped, about 7 µm long, in several rows between circumoral kinety, and scattered
in cytoplasm (Foissner 1984); “basically rod-shaped to slightly ovate and asymmetrical, 5–8 µm, usually
6–7 µm long, when exploded of typical toxicyst structure, that is, with a tube emerging from the empty
capsule” (Foissner et al. 2002). Type II extrusomes oblong, 2–4 µm, usually 2.5–3 µm long; overlooked
by Foissner (1984) but later found by Foissner et al. (2002) in specimens from the same area.
Cortex flexible, colourless, slightly furrowed by ciliary rows in SEM micrographs, contains several
rows of granules (mucocysts) between adjacent kineties. Granules ordinarily spaced both in somatic and
oral cortex, minute (< 0.8 µm) and oblong, strongly impregnate with silver carbonate (Figs 69j, 71c–f).
Silverline pattern studied in Austrian (Foissner 1984) and Chinese (song 1994a) specimens, composed

of polygonal meshes about 0.4 μm in size, not yet examined in detail (Figs 69i, r). Cytoplasm colourless,
hyaline in proboscis and tail, opaque in trunk due to many lipid droplets 1–3 μm across and food vacuoles
containing ciliates, e.g., Vorticella sp. Often a defecation vacuole with granular material near base of tail.
Swims rapidly, somewhat wriggly (Foissner 1984).
Cilia ordinarily to narrowly spaced, in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids. Ciliary rows ordinarily
spaced, extend longitudinally following body curvature, number rather variable, viz., 22–26 in French
specimens (Dragesco 1960), 21–30, on average 26 in Austrian cells (Foissner 1984), 16–19 in Chinese
specimens (possibly slightly underestimated as indicated by song’s drawing), and 19–26, on average 21 in
Zanzibar exemplars (Foissner et al. 2002). Details of ciliary pattern studied in three populations (Foissner
1984, song 1994a, Foissner et al. 2002). Some right side rows shortened in proboscis area; perioral kinety
extends to tip of proboscis with ordinarily to narrowly spaced basal bodies (Figs 69m, p, s, t, 70b, c, o).
Both sides of proboscis with a blank stripe, that on left side broader than that on right because most rows
end at base of proboscis (Figs 69m, t, 70c, o, p, 72a, b, d, e, h, i). Ventral rows distinctly curved rightwards
when abutting on circumoral kinety in Austrian and Zanzibar specimens (Figs 69m, 70b, c). Dorsal brush
a long field on dorsal and dorsolateral area of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; composed of
about eight rows (Figs 70a, c, o, p, 72b, h, i); as concerns song (1994a), see taxonomy section above (Fig.
69t). Brush dikinetids loosely to ordinarily spaced, associated with type I bristles: anterior bristles about
2–3 μm long in vivo (1.0–1.7 μm in SEM), posterior bristles gradually decrease in length from about 1.5
μm to 1 μm (SEM measurements), becoming inconspicuous stumps in posterior dikinetidal brush region.
All rows continue with a monokinetidal tail extending to base of proboscis with type VI bristles 0.8–1 μm
long in SEM (Figs 72d, e, h, j, k).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second third of body; projects slightly to distinctly because base of
proboscis more or less narrowed; ovate in vivo, about 10 µm across in SEM preparations, sometimes
ellipsoidal after protargol impregnation, possibly an artefact occurring also in other species (Figs 69h,
m, p, s, t, 70b, c, 71c, 72a, c, d). Pharyngeal basket obconical, distinct both in vivo and in protargol
preparations, without specific features. Oral bulge distinct in SEM micrographs because broad and limited
by metachronal ciliary waves (Figs 72c, f, g). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced dikinetids
in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening. Preoral kineties in distinct
furrows, oblique, ordinarily spaced, each composed of two to four, usually three narrowly spaced cilia
(Figs 69m, p, s, t, 70b, p, 72d, e, h, j, k).
Resting cyst: Described by Foissner et al. (2002): “The resting cysts of a cultivated Kenyan population are
spherical to slightly ellipsoidal, have an average diameter of 60 μm, and are surrounded by a conspicuous
mucous layer, which sometimes contains extruded cyst material. The cysts are conspicuously honey-
yellow/brown because the about 2 μm thick wall has this colour, which is clearly recognizable in squashed
cysts” (Figs 71m–p; Table 36).
Occurrence and ecology: Although R. mucronatus occurs in limnetic habitats, it is the most common
middle-sized dileptid in terrestrial environments. As yet recorded from four main biogeographic regions,
showing cosmopolitan distribution: Holarctic (both in Palearctic and Nearctic), Paleotropis (e.g., Benin,
Kenya, Zanzibar), Neotropis (e.g., Venezuela, St. Vincent Island), and Australis.
Records from terrestrial and semi-terrestrial habitats: upper soil layer of a meadow in the surroundings of
a lake (Neusiedlersee) in Burgenland, Austria (Foissner 1984, Foissner et al. 2002); with low abundance
in leaf litter from the surroundings of the town of Stupava, Slovakia (unpubl. observations); in soil and
litter (pH 6.0) of a leguminosae field in the Al-Hassa oasis, a few km east of the town of Al-Hofuf, Saudi
Arabia (Foissner et al. 2008b); soil from the surroundings of the town of Qingdao, China (song 1994a);

USA (Vďačný et al. 2011b); in a variety of soil samples from Benin, Kenya, Zanzibar, the Caribbean, and
Venezuela (Foissner et al. 2002); upper soil layer with some sand and much litter (pH 4.2) from bush in
the Brisbane Water National Park about 50 km north of Sydney, and in the upper mouldy needle and soil
layer (pH 5.1) of a pine forest in a suburb of Adelaide, Australia (Blatterer & Foissner 1988).
Records from limnetic habitats: drain in the surroundings (Pinchat) of the town of Geneva, Switzerland
(PenarD 1922); in fine sand of the Excenevex beach, Lake Léman, France (Dragesco 1960, 1963); Priest
Pot in England (Finlay & maBerly 2000); Manzanares River near Madrid, Spain (FernánDez-leBorans
& antonia-garcía 1988); in two beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic Upper Austrian rivers (Blatterer 1994);
possibly in organic mud from a tributary of the Gidra River near the village of Voderady, Slovakia
(tirJakoVá 2003); surroundings of the town of Sofia, Bulgaria (DetcheVa 1992); Turkish inland waters
(ÇaPar 2007); coast of Lake Okoboji, Iowa, USA (shawhan et al. 1947); 43 ind./l in a fishless, intermittent
pond in Vandorf, Ontario, Canada (anDrushchyshyn et al. 2006).
Rimaleptus tirjakovae (Vďačný & FoissnEr, 2008) nov. comb. (Figs 73a–o, 74a–l; Table 37)
2008 Dileptus tirjakovae nov. sp. Vďačný & Foissner, J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 55: 437
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus tirjakovae with Rimaleptus because of the two
macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Rimaleptus tirjakovae is almost unique in having
two abutting, globular macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus in the vertex of the nodules, a highly
constant pattern found in over 800 specimens. A similar pattern is found in R. lacazei, R. robustus and R.
ovalis. The former lives in saline environments like R. tirjakovae, but differs by the distinct tail and the
highly contractile proboscis. Rimaleptus robustus and R. ovalis are distinguished from R. tirjakovae by the
presence (vs. absence) of endosymbiotic green algae and the habitat (freshwater vs. saline coastal soil).
Diagnosis: Size about 230 × 25 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like with posterior
region acute or, rarely, tail-like, proboscis about 40% of body length. Two globular, abutting macronuclear
nodules with a micronucleus in nodule vertex. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles with 1–3 pores each.
Two size-types (6 μm and 2.5–3 μm) of basically rod-shaped extrusomes attached to right branch of oral
bulge. On average 21 ciliary rows; dorsal brush diffuse with bristles up to 3 μm long. Oral bulge opening
about 12 × 9 μm in size. Preoral kineties oblique, widely spaced, each usually composed of 2 ordinarily
spaced cilia.
Type locality: Highly saline coastal soil from the bay of Nauplia, Greece, E22°43’ N37°33’.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/336) and seven paratype slides (inv. no. 2011/337–343)
with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant vegetative and conjugating individuals as well as exconjugants are
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Dedication: Named in honour of Dr. Eva tirJakoVá (Comenius University), as a small token of appreciation
for guiding the junior author into ciliatology.
Description: Size 170–320 × 15–35 μm in vivo, usually about 230 × 25 μm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming 15% preparation shrinkage; flexible but not
contractile (Table 37). Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like, length:width ratio highly variable (7.5–
15:1), on average near 10:1 in prepared cells. Proboscis occupies about 40% of body length, slightly to
distinctly curved; trunk cylindroidal to bluntly fusiform, widest in mid-portion; posterior end elongate

Macronucleus pattern highly constant, that is, two globular nodules in over 800 specimens analyzed; very
rarely cells with either a single globular or ellipsoidal nodule. Individual nodules usually close together,
about 13 μm across in vivo; nucleoli globular, small to medium-sized. Micronucleus usually in vertex
formed by the abutting macronuclear nodules, i.e., not in between nodules; globular, blister-like and about
3 μm across in vivo, deeply impregnated with protargol (Figs 73a–c, g, k–o, 74a, b, d, g, i–l). A row
with an average of six contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk and proximal half of proboscis, no
ventral vacuoles; up to three excretory pores per vacuole (Figs 73a, b, i, j, 74c; Table 37). Two types of
extrusomes, impregnating with protargol, attached to broader right branch of oral bulge (Figs 73a, e, 74h,
j, l): type I rod-shaped to very narrowly ovate with rounded ends, about 6 × 1 μm in size, very sensitive,
i.e., explode partially and become more or less distinctly clavate under even slight coverslip pressure
(Fig. 73f), frequent also in cytoplasm, where certain developmental stages sometimes impregnate with
231

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
protargol; type II finely rod-shaped, about 2.5–3 μm long, more numerous than type I. Cortex very flexible,
contains about ten oblique granule rows between adjacent kineties; granules inconspicuous because pale
and only ~ 0.7 × 0.3 μm in size. Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in proboscis and rear body end, opaque
in trunk due to numerous granules ~ 0.4 μm across and 3–10 μm-sized vacuoles with sparse contents or
some spores of bacteria, likely remnants from prey; feeds on medium-sized ciliates, such as Metopus
hasei and Vorticellides astyliformis digested in large vacuoles often deforming cells. Movement without
peculiarities.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily to densely spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids,
i.e., with thick, strongly impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of 21
narrowly spaced, longitudinal rows leaving a narrow, barren area left and right of circumoral kinety (Figs
73c, g; Table 37). First row right of oral bulge extends as perioral kinety with ordinarily spaced cilia
along circumoral kinety to tip of proboscis. Dorsal brush remarkable because not composed of staggered
rows, as usual in dileptids, but of about 40 scattered dikinetids with 3 μm long type I bristles; followed by
scattered monokinetids with 1 μm long type VI bristles (Figs 73c, d, g, h–j, 74c; Table 37).
Oral apparatus as in other dileptids, oral bulge opening slightly above mid-body; base of proboscis hardly
widened and only half as wide as trunk, pharyngeal opening thus distinctly projecting. Pharyngeal basket
distinct both in vivo and in protargol preparations (Figs 73a, c, g, 74d–f, k). Circumoral kinety dikinetidal,
except for monokinetidal portion around oral bulge opening (Figs 74e, f, h). Preoral kineties oblique,
widely spaced, each composed of two, rarely three ordinarily spaced basal bodies (Figs 73g, 74h, k).
Conjugation: See “General Part”.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, that is, the west coast of the Golf of Nauplia,
exactly opposite to the town of Nauplia, Peloponnese, Greece. Here, the newly formed land is covered by
a halophytic vegetation, especially, hemispherical, spiny colonies of rush. The soil is strongly saline, very
hard when dry, and has pH 6.9 in water. The sample consisted of vegetation residues and the upper 0–2 cm
soil layer which contained many fine grass roots.

2008 Dileptus longitrichus nov. sp. Vďačný & Foissner, Acta Protozool. 47: 219
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus longitrichus with Rimaleptus because of the
two macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Among the congeners, R. longitrichus is unique
in having very long dorsal brush bristles (up to 15 µm vs. 3–4 µm) and a row of contractile vacuoles each
in ventral and dorsal side of body (vs. only dorsal vacuoles).
Diagnosis: Size about 210 × 30 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with narrowly
rounded posterior end, proboscis about 37% of body length. Two oblong macronuclear nodules with 1–2
micronuclei in between. A row of contractile vacuoles each in ventral and dorsal side of body. Extrusomes
rod-shaped, 2.5–3 μm long. On average 20 ciliary rows, 2 anteriorly differentiated into a conspicuous,
isostichad dorsal brush with bristles up to 15 μm long: brush rows not staggered, composed of an average
of 27 and 24 dikinetids, respectively; both rows with a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to base of
proboscis. Oral bulge opening roundish, about 10 μm across. On average 25 ordinarily to widely spaced
preoral kineties, each composed of 2–5 narrowly to ordinarily spaced kinetids, forming strongly oblique
rows sometimes almost parallel to circumoral kinety.
Type locality: Soil from a mixed forest in the surroundings of the town of Tsukuba, Japan, E140°04’
N36°02’.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/272) and twelve paratype slides (inv. nos 2011/273–

284) with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin adjective longus (long) and the Greek noun thrix (hair ~ cilia),
referring to the very long dorsal bristles.
Description: Size 160–260 × 20–45 μm in vivo, usually about 210 × 30 μm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming 15% preparation shrinkage; length:width ratio
rather variable, depending on nutrition state, on average 7:1 both in vivo and in protargol preparations
(Table 38). Shape narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with flattened proboscis occupying about one third
of body length; both body ends narrowly rounded, posterior end never tail-like; dorsal outline straight to
sigmoidal (Figs 75a, c, f–i). Nuclear apparatus slightly above mid of trunk. Two macronuclear nodules
with concave proximal end surrounding micronucleus; individual nodules ellipsoidal to very narrowly
ellipsoidal or very narrowly ovoidal, on average 25 × 8 μm in size (Table 38). One to two micronuclei (of
22 specimens investigated, 12 had one and 10 had two micronuclei) in between macronuclear nodules,
about 3 μm across, in protargol preparations surrounded by a distinct membrane (Figs 75a, c, f–i, t; Table
38). A row of contractile vacuoles each in ventral and dorsal side of cell, first dorsal vacuole near base of
proboscis (Fig. 75a). Extrusomes inconspicuous, i.e., rod-shaped with both ends rounded and only 2.5–3
μm long, do not impregnate with the protargol method used (Fig. 75k). Cortex very flexible, contains
about four oblique granule rows between adjacent kineties; granules narrowly spaced in somatic and oral
cortex, ellipsoidal, ~ 1 × 0.5 μm in size (Figs 75b, j, l). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in proboscis and rear
body end, opaque in trunk due to numerous globular and irregular lipid droplets 2–7 μm across and food
vacuoles with small ciliates, e.g., Vorticellides astyliformis and microthoracid (?) oral baskets (Figs 75a,
i). Movement without peculiarities.

Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e., with
thick, deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of 20 ordinarily
spaced, longitudinal rows anteriorly gradually shortened along right side of oral bulge, except for perioral
kinety which extends with ordinarily spaced basal bodies to tip of proboscis (Figs 75c, n, p, r; Table 38).
Left side of proboscis with conspicuous blank stripe because left side ciliary rows shortened at level of oral
bulge opening, except for one to two kineties extending into proximal quarter of proboscis (Figs 75d, e).
Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of two isostichad rows with a similar number
of loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids; both rows begin subapically and continue with a monokinetidal
tail to base of proboscis (Figs 75a, d, e, o, q, r). Each brush row composed of three types of bristles (Fig.
75m): (i) anterior portion with type III bristles obliquely spread backwards in swimming specimens and
highly conspicuous because of up to 15 μm long and slightly thicker than ordinary somatic cilia, decrease
in length anteriorly and posteriorly or, sometimes, gradually from anterior to posterior; (ii) followed by
some about 4 μm long type II bristles; (iii) posterior brush portion (tail) composed of 2 μm long type VI
bristles.
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, about 10 μm across, roundish both in vivo and in
preparations (Figs 75b, p). Pharyngeal basket short, composed of many fine rods; internal basket about
half as long as external one in protargol preparations (Table 38). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily
spaced dikinetids, except for narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening; right branch
curves around anterior end of proboscis, while left branch ends subapically almost touching curved right
end. On average 25 ordinarily to widely spaced preoral kineties, each composed of two to five narrowly to
ordinarily spaced monokinetids forming strongly oblique rows sometimes almost in line with left branch
of circumoral kinety (Figs 75d, e, p, s).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, that is, in a slightly acidic (pH 4.9) mixture
of litter, fine plant roots, and red-brown soil from a mixed forest (deciduous and cedar trees) in the
surroundings of the town of Tsukuba, Japan.

1995 Dileptus similis nov. sp. Foissner, Arch. Protistenk. 145: 43
1999 Dileptus similis Foissner, 1995 – Foissner, Biodivers. Conserv. 8: 334 (description of a Kenyan population)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus similis with Rimaleptus because of the two
macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Rimaleptus similis resembles R. orientalis and R.
conspicuus. Rimaleptus orientalis differs by the proboscis (about 1/3 vs. 1/2 of body length), the number
of the ciliary rows (17 vs. 30), and the shape of the extrusomes (massive and broadly fusiform to ellipsoidal
vs. thin and almost rod-like). Rimaleptus conspicuus is considerably smaller than R. similis (141 µm vs.
219 µm in protargol preparations) and has only two (vs. at least four) contractile vacuoles and a strongly
(vs. slightly) rostrate proboscis.
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 250 × 50 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
to very narrowly dileptid with rounded posterior end, proboscis about 48% of body length. Two oblong
macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus in between. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles with several
excretory pores each. Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge: type I rod-shaped, 6–10 ×
1 μm in size; type II oblong, about 3 μm long. On average 30 ciliary rows, about 6 anteriorly differentiated
into a staggered, distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with bristles up to 2 µm long. Oral bulge opening
about 25 μm across. Preoral kineties oblique, ordinarily to narrowly spaced, each usually composed of 3
narrowly spaced kinetids.

Type locality: Upper soil layer in the surroundings of the ranch house “La Casona”, Santa Rosa National
Park, Costa Rica, W85°38’ N10°50’.
Type and voucher material: Foissner (1995a) deposited one holotype (inv. no. 1997/98) and one paratype
(inv. no. 1997/99) slide with protargol-impregnated Costa Rican specimens in the Biology Centre of the
Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Foissner (1999) deposited two voucher slides (inv. nos 1999/9 and
1999/10) with protargol-impregnated Kenyan specimens in the same repository. Relevant specimens are
marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The epithet refers to the supposed similarity with R. mucronatus. However, this has been
disproved meanwhile by the detailed investigations of further populations.

Description: This species has been studied in three populations from Costa Rica (type; Foissner 1995a),
Kenya (voucher; Foissner 1995a), and Australia (unpubl.). They match very well, therefore the description
summarizes all observations.
Size usually about 250 × 50 μm in vivo: type specimens 200–300 × 40–90 μm, Kenyan individuals 230–300
× 40–65 μm, and Australian cells 200–300 × 40–50 μm; very flexible but not contractile. Shape narrowly
to very narrowly dileptid, i.e., length:width ratio 2.9–6.7:1, on average 4.8:1 (Table 39). Proboscis leaf-like
flattened, slightly sickle-shaped, occupies almost half of body length on average, conspicuously widened
near oral bulge opening and thus indistinctly set off from oblong to bluntly fusiform trunk; posterior end
rounded, never acute or tail-like (Figs 76a, f, g, i–k, o). Nuclear apparatus in centre of trunk. Invariably

and slightly above cytopyge (Figs 76a, f, l, o). Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge
and scattered throughout cytoplasm: type I rod-like with slightly narrowed ends, 8–10 × 1 μm in type
specimens, 7–8 μm and 6 µm long in Kenyan and Australian cells, respectively; type II oblong, fine, about
3 μm long (Figs 76b, n). Cortex very flexible, colourless, contains about six oblique rows of 0.8 μm-
sized granules between adjacent somatic kineties (Fig. 76d). Cytoplasm colourless, packed with numerous
granules 1–2 μm across, up to 10 μm-sized lipid droplets, and large globular to ellipsoidal food vacuoles
containing whole ciliates, e.g., Frontonia depressa; loose materials; or long bacteria, possibly remnants
from prey.
Cilia 8–10 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced. Ciliary rows ordinarily spaced, extend meridionally, on
average 28 rows in Costa Rican specimens and 31 in Kenyan cells (Table 39). Perioral kinety extends to
tip of proboscis with narrowly spaced basal bodies (Figs 76f, h, k). Both sides of proboscis with a blank
stripe, that on right side narrower than that on left where most left side rows end at base of proboscis (Figs
76f–h, k, m). Dorsal brush a long field on dorsal and dorsolateral region of proboscis; staggered; distinctly
heterostichad; composed of about six rows of loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids associated with type
III bristles both being only 1–2 μm long (Figs 76c, e, g, l, m).
Oral bulge opening about 25 μm across in vivo. Pharyngeal basket obconical, distinct both in vivo and after
protargol impregnation, composed of many delicate rods (Figs 76a, g, h, k). Circumoral kinety composed
of narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening.
About 70 oblique, narrowly spaced preoral kineties, as estimated from figures, each composed of two to
four, usually three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 76g, h, k–m).
Occurrence and ecology: Rimaleptus similis was discovered in a tropical dry forest, viz., in the upper soil
layer of the Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica, where it occurred together with Dileptus costaricanus
(Foissner 1995a). In Kenya, Rimaleptus similis occurred in a coastal rain forest around a picnic site in
the Shimba Hills Nature Reserve; the sample was a mixture of the upper 0–5 cm litter and soil layer;
the brown, humic, slightly acidic (pH 6.1) soil contained a dense root carpet, as typical for rain forests
(Foissner 1999). In Namibia, R. similis occurred in the southern escarpment of the Namib Desert, i.e., in
the vicinity of the Büllsport Guest Farm; the 0–10 cm soil sample (pH 7.7) was taken from the margin of a
small pond surrounded by sedges and Ficus trees (Foissner et al. 2002). In Australia, we found Rimaleptus
similis in the very sandy soil under a Beef-wood (Casuarina) tree on Green Island near the town of Cairns,
about 20 m distant from the coast. As yet, not found in Europe.

1988 Dileptus orientalis sp. n. song, PackroFF & wilBert, Acta Protozool. 27: 272
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus orientalis with Rimaleptus because of the two
macronuclear nodules and the ordinary oral basket. Within the congeners, R. orientalis is outstanding in
having minute but massive type I extrusomes. In this respect, it resembles R. brasiliensis, Microdileptus
microstoma and M. semiarmatus. However, all differ from Rimaleptus orientalis by shape details of the
extrusomes, the shorter proboscis (1/5–1/4 vs. 1/3 of body length), and the lower number of the ciliary
rows (7–13 vs. 15–19).
Improved diagnosis: Size about 200 × 23 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly to very narrowly dileptid with
rounded posterior end, proboscis about 1/3 of body length. Two oblong macronuclear nodules with a
micronucleus in between. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles with 2–3 excretory pores each. Two types
of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge: type I massive, broadly fusiform to ellipsoidal, 1–2 μm
long; type II fine, oblong, 1–2 μm long. On average 17 ciliary rows, three (or more?) differentiated into an

isostichad dorsal brush. Oral bulge opening about
15 μm across. Preoral kineties oblique to strongly
oblique, ordinarily to widely spaced, usually
composed of 3 narrowly spaced kinetids.
Type locality: Soil from the surroundings of the
town of Qingdao, China, E120°43’ N36°8’.
Type material: Deposition not mentioned in the
original paper (song et al. 1988) but Prof. W. song
deposits all type material in the College of Fisheries,
Ocean University of Qingdao, China.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The
Latin adjective orientalis obviously refers to the
region in which the species was discovered.
Description: Length 150–250 μm in vivo; very
flexible. Shape narrowly to very narrowly dileptid,
i.e., length:width ratio 5–7:1, according to the
figures provided, but 9.3:1 on average according
to the morphometric data (Table 40). Proboscis
occupies about one third of body length, slightly
set off from cylindroidal to bluntly fusiform
trunk; posterior end slightly to conspicuously
flattened, usually rounded, rarely acute (Figs 77a,
b, f, h; Table 40). Nuclear apparatus in centre of
trunk. Invariably two macronuclear nodules with
a globular micronucleus in between; individual
nodules oblong and curved, about 25 × 7 μm in size
after protargol impregnation; nucleoli ellipsoidal to
lobate (Figs 77a, b, f, h; Table 40). A dorsal row
of five to eight contractile vacuoles each with
two to three excretory pores, posterior vacuoles
sometimes larger than anterior ones (Figs 77a, f,
g). Two types of extrusomes impregnate with the
protargol method used, attached to proboscis oral
bulge and scattered throughout cytoplasm: type I
minute but massive, broadly fusiform to ellipsoidal,
1–2 μm long; type II fine, oblong, 1–2 μm long,

peri oral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with narrowly spaced basal bodies (Figs 77c, h). Blank stripe
on left side of proboscis broad because most left side kineties end at level of oral bulge opening or slightly
above (Figs 77g, h). Ventral rows slightly or indistinctly curved rightwards when abutting on circumoral
kinety (Figs 77c, g, h). Dorsal brush on dorsal and dorsolateral side of proboscis, three-rowed and
isostichad (Fig. 77g); observations possibly not correct (see R. mucronatus). Silverline pattern composed
of very small, polygonal meshes; not studied in detail (Fig. 77e).
Oral bulge opening about 15 μm across in protargol preparations (Fig. 77h). Pharyngeal basket obconical,
without specific features (Figs 77c, f, g, h). Oral ciliary pattern dileptid, i.e., left branch of circumoral
kinety associated with many oblique to strongly oblique, ordinarily to widely spaced preoral kineties, each
composed of two to three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 77g, h).
Occurrence and ecology: song et al. (1988) discovered R. orientalis in soil from the surroundings of the
town of Qingdao, China. Foissner (2000) recorded this species from two localities in Germany, viz., from
terra fusca-rendzina soil (pH 4.3–6.8) of a beech forest about 7 km east of the town of Göttingen, and from
a mixture of litter and soil of a beech forest about 30 km NW the town of Kassel.
Microdileptus nov. gen.
Diagnosis: Small-sized Dimacrocaryonidae with very narrow to rod-shaped body. Two macronuclear
nodules. Dorsal brush staggered and two-rowed. Right branch of circumoral kinety accompanied by a
perioral kinety, left branch by a row of widely spaced, more or less grouped preoral kinetids. Oral bulge
opening dileptid, i.e., roundish and located ventrally, but conspicuously small (diameter usually < 5 µm).
Oral basket bulbous.

Etymology: Composite of the Greek adjective mikros (small) and the generic name Dileptus, referring to
the small oral opening. Masculine gender.
Species assignable: Dileptus breviproboscis Foissner, 1981; D. microstoma Vďačný & Foissner, 2008;
and D. semiarmatus Vďačný & Foissner, 2008.
Remarks: The three species of this new genus have two conspicuous apomorphies in common: (i) the
preoral kineties are small and so strongly oblique that a more or less “grouped row” is produced left of the
circumoral kinety; and (ii) a very small oral bulge opening, which, however, can open widely during prey
ingestion (Figs 79j, k, 80l). A distinct genus is indicated also by the molecular trees, where Microdileptus
microstoma forms a separate and rather long branch (Figs 34, 35). The special kind of preoral kinety occurs
also in Monilicaryon monilatum, a member of the family Dileptidae (Figs 14, 106b, h, q–s). However, this
species is very large (~ 600 µm) and has a moniliform macronucleus and only one dorsal brush row. Thus,
the special preoral pattern very likely evolved convergently in Monilicaryon and Microdileptus.
The three species agree also in having a small-sized (~ 180 µm) and very slender (8–11:1) body, a short
proboscis (~ 1/5–1/3 of body length), 9–10 ciliary rows, and 8–12 µm long brush bristles. They differ
distinctly in the shape of the extrusomes (ampulliform in M. microstoma, cuneate in M. semiarmatus,
and oblong in M. breviproboscis) and some specialities (contractile vacuoles lacking in mid-body in M.
microstoma; extrusomes lacking in distal half of proboscis in M. semiarmatus). These are subtle differences,
needing careful live observations.

D. anguillula in their table on page 38; resurrection of species, based on a misidentified population here
considered as a new species, Rimaleptus brasiliensis)
Taxonomy: This species is a typical example of the confusion produced by poorly described species. The
only excuse is the insufficient experience of the senior author in 1981 and the tiny body of this species,
which makes it difficult to investigate.
Foissner (1984) synonymized Dileptus breviproboscis with D. anguillula because the nuclear apparatus
appeared highly variable. However, a reinvestigation of the 1984 population showed that only two out of
100 specimens are binucleate, while 98 have a distinctly moniliform macronucleus. Thus, D. breviproboscis
and D. anguillula are distinct species. Based on Foissner (1984) and new data on the extrusomes, Foissner
et al. (2002) resurrected D. breviproboscis: “Unfortunately, the original descriptions of D. anguillula and D.
breviproboscis lack detailed data about the extrusomes. Thus, they cannot be assigned to any of the two types

Type locality: Soil from the Hochmais-Alm, i.e., an alpine pasture along the Grossglockner-
Hochalpenstrasse, Hohe Tauern, Salzburg, Austria, 1850 m above sea level, E12°48’ N47°7’.
Type and voucher material: Foissner (1981) deposited one holotype slide (inv. no. 1981/7) with a
protargol-impregnated Austrian (Schloss-Alm in Gastein area) specimen in the Biology Centre of the
Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). However, a reinvestigation of this slide showed that it contains a
single, poorly impregnated specimen from the Schloss-Alm in the Gastein area, not from the Hochmais-
Alm along the Grossglockner Hochalpenstrasse, as stated in the description of the type locality by Foissner
(1981). Very likely, Foissner (1981) used both, specimens from the Schloss-Alm and from the Hochmais-
Alm for the description. All good slides were used as types for other new species. Thus, we investigated
another population from the Gastein area, viz., from an Alnetum viridis on the Stubnerkogel, which is only
a few km away from the Schloss-Alm. In these slides, there are some well-impregnated specimens which
were designated as “vouchers” and stored in the Museum of Upper Austria (inv. nos 2011/372–375).
A specimen of this series can be used as a neotype when the matter has been settled, i.e., the identity
of Microdileptus breviproboscis, Pseudomonilicaryon anguillula, and Rimaleptus brasiliensis has been
clarified beyond reasonable doubts.
Further, we studied a new Brazilian population in great detail. Two voucher slides (inv. nos 2011/344 and
2011/345) have been deposited in the repository mentioned above.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Latin adjective brevis (short) and the
noun proboscis, referring to the short proboscis.
Description of Austrian populations: Size 130–200 × 10–20 µm in vivo and 85–167 µm (mean =118.9,
n = 8) × 8–13 µm (mean = 10.2, n = 8) in protargol preparations (Foissner 1981), matching sizes obtained
from impregnated Stubnerkogel specimens (Table 42): 108–160 µm (mean = 125.2) × 12–20 µm (mean
= 16.6). Including 15% preparation shrinkage, an usual in vivo size of 145 × 18 µm (125–185 × 14–23
µm) can be assumed. Average length:width ratio about 13:1 in Foissner (1981), while 8:1 in Stubnerkogel
specimens (Table 42). Shape thus very narrowly to rod-like dileptid, not or inconspicuously flattened
laterally (Figs 78a, b); very fragile, frequently shedding proboscis when the coverslip is put on the drop
containing the specimens. Nuclear apparatus slightly above mid-trunk (Figs 78a, b); nuclear figure on
average about 30 µm long in both populations (Foissner 1981; Table 42). Macronuclear nodules oblong
to strongly spiralized, on average 3.3 µm and 5.7 µm in width, respectively (Foissner 1981; Table 42).
Micronucleus in between macronuclear nodules, about 1.5 µm across. About six contractile vacuoles in
dorsal side, one to three pores per vacuole associated with kinety bearing brush row 2 (Figs 78a, d, g). Oral
bulge extrusomes oblong and about 3 µm long. Cortex and cytoplasm colourless, usually hyaline, some
specimens contain many inclusions about 2 µm across; subterminally, frequently a defecation vacuole with
granular contents. Feeds on flagellates and fungal spores. Swims and glides slowly and serpentinously.
Cilia about 9 µm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced on average, more loosely arranged in posterior third of
trunk, longest rows with about 30 cilia (the up to 80 cilia in Foissner 1981 are very likely a mistake);
in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids; arranged in an average of 8.7 (n = 8) and 10 (n = 11)
ordinarily spaced, longitudinal rows, respectively (Foissner 1981; Table 42); leave blank a rather broad
stripe on right and left side of proboscis because about half of kineties commence near level of oral bulge
opening. First ciliary row right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety to tip of proboscis with
ordinarily to widely spaced cilia (Figs 78c, f). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed
of two staggered, isostichad rows with a median of 11 widely spaced and 15 widely to ordinarily spaced
dikinetids in rows 1 and 2, respectively; bristles slightly thicker than ordinary cilia, up to 6 µm long
in protargol-impregnated specimens from the Stubnerkogel, possibly misinterpreted as ordinary somatic
cilia by Foissner (1981).

inconspicuous because hardly projecting and very small, i.e., about 2.5 µm (Foissner 1981) or 5 × 4.4
µm (Table 42). Pharyngeal basket bulbous and short. Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily to
widely spaced dikinetids in proboscis and of narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening,
right branch with a conspicuous condensation of kinetids apically (Figs 78c, e, f). Preoral kineties each
composed of two to three ordinarily to widely spaced cilia, forming a more or less distinct row left of
circumoral kinety (Figs 78b, c, e, f).
Description of a Brazilian population: High numbers of Microdileptus breviproboscis developed in a
sample consisting of the up to 2 cm thick litter layer as well as organic debris and fine roots sieved off
the upper 15 cm sand horizon from the Restingha (shrub) region in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
about 1 km distant the Atlantic Ocean coast. The sample, which was slightly saline (~ 5‰) and had a pH of
5.3, contained about 40 ciliate species, several of which were undescribed. Microdileptus breviproboscis
was possibly at the end of the logarithmic growth phase because there were many specimens, including
some conjugation pairs, but few dividers.
Size 100–200 × 10–25 µm in vivo, usually about 155 × 18 µm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data (Table 42). Shape narrowly to rod-like dileptid with proboscis
occupying about one fifth of body length on average, posterior end narrowly rounded or acute, but never
tail-like; widest in mid-trunk with ventral side usually more convex than dorsal one, proboscis flattened
and slightly to distinctly curved dorsally; trunk unflattened, usually bluntly fusiform, rarely cylindroidal or
distinctly winding (Figs 79a, c–e, o, p, 80a–e), strongly inflated during and after swallowing the prey (Figs
79j–l, 80l–n). Nuclear apparatus usually slightly above middle third of trunk, may be strongly dislocated
by large prey, in 90% out of 214 specimens investigated composed of two macronuclear nodules and a
micronucleus in between, in 10% of cells abnormal, e.g., nodules not separated or one nodule distinctly
smaller than the other; some variability possibly caused by late post-dividers and injured specimens.
Individual macronuclear nodules usually more or less clavate and sometimes slightly spiralized, abut with
broad end on micronucleus; nucleoli ordinary, i.e., globular and rather numerous. Micronucleus in vivo
surrounded by a distinct membrane rarely recognizable in protargol preparations, about 3 µm in size with
membrane; after protargol impregnation broadly ellipsoidal and about 1.6 × 1.2 µm without membrane
(Figs 79a, p, 80a–e, l–t; Table 42). Several minute contractile vacuoles in dorsal side, first vacuole at

bulge and scattered in cytoplasm, often forming small aggregates; inconspicuous because only about 3
× 0.4 µm in size and oblong with rounded ends (Figs 79a, b, i). Cortex very flexible and soft, colourless,
contains about six oblique granule rows between adjacent kineties; granules narrowly spaced in somatic
and oral cortex, about 0.5 × 0.25 µm in size (Fig. 79h). All specimens covered by a 5–7 µm thick layer
not recognizable in vivo but yellowishly impregnated with the protargol method used (Figs 79e, 80o, p).
Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in proboscis and rear end, while more or less opaque in trunk, depending
on nutrition state. Possibly feeds only on morphostatic and dividing naked amoebae (12 cases observed)
about 50 µm across, i.e., much larger than the minute oral opening, which can expand widely ingesting
prey as a whole (Figs 79j, k, 80l). When inside the trunk, the prey becomes surrounded by a large vacuole
deforming the cell (Figs 79l, 80m). Then, the prey disaggregates, forming many small food vacuoles 5–10
µm across (Figs 79a, 80n).

Microdileptus breviproboscis feeds on morphostatic (m) and dividing (l) naked amoebae, greatly expanding the minute oral
opening (l). When the prey is in the cytoplasm (m), it disintegrates into many minute vacuoles (n); o–t –variability of nuclear
apparatus, which consists of two clavate to oblong macronuclear nodules and a single micronucleus in between. Microdileptus
breviproboscis is fully covered by a substance becoming yellowish in protargol preparations (o, p). B – dorsal brush, CK –
circumoral kinety, FV – food vacuoles, MA – macronuclear nodules, MI – micronucleus, N – nuclei of the dividing amoeba, OO
– oral opening, PE – perioral kinety. Scale bars: 15 µm (k, o–t) and 50 µm (l–n).

Cilia about 7 µm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced on average; in protargol preparations within the cover
described above and with thick, strongly impregnated distal half, except for dorsal and tail bristles (Figs
80a–o); arranged in an average of 10 ordinarily spaced, longitudinal rows leaving a blank stripe on
right and left side of proboscis, that on left side usually broader than that on right, about half of kineties
commence at or below level of oral bulge opening (Figs 79f, n–o; Table 42). First ciliary row right of
circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety to tip of proboscis with ordinarily to widely spaced cilia
(Figs 79f, o, 80k). First ciliary row left of circumoral kinety composed of widely spaced preoral kinetids
(Figs 79f, n, p, 80f, i). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of two staggered,
isostichad rows. Brush bristles conspicuous because up to 12 µm long and slightly thicker than ordinary
cilia, length distinctly decreases at both ends of rows. Brush row 1 commences subapically, composed
of an average of 14 ordinarily spaced dikinetids with anterior bristle about half as long as posterior one,
continues to second third of body with a long, monokinetidal tail of about 1.5 µm long bristles. Brush
row 2 commences apically with some monokinetids, composed of an average of 18 ordinarily spaced
dikinetids, each associated with two bristles of similar length, continues with a very short, monokinetidal
tail of two to five 1.5 µm long bristles (Figs 79a, g, m–p, 80g–i, k; Table 42).
Oral apparatus basically as in other dileptids, but with several specializations. Oral bulge opening at end
of anterior body fifth, broadly ovate to circular, only about 4 µm wide and thus difficult to recognize.
Pharyngeal basket hardly recognizable both in vivo and in protargol preparations because composed
of very fine and faintly impregnated rods (Figs 79a, b, f, o, p, 80a–k). Circumoral kinety composed
of ordinarily to widely spaced dikinetids, except for narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge
opening, becoming very widely spaced when large prey is ingested (Figs 79j, k); right and left branch
only 1–2 µm apart, likely due to the small, rather distinctly flattened proboscis; right branch with a rather
conspicuous condensation of kinetids apically. Preoral kineties composed of widely spaced monokinetids,
forming a fairly regular row along left branch of circumoral kinety (Figs 79f, n, p, 80f, i).
Occurrence and ecology: According to Foissner (1998), M. breviproboscis has been recorded from all
main biogeographic regions, except Antarctica. However, when considering the identification problems,
most records must be doubted, except of the type locality and the Brazilian population described here. And
even this is not entirely sure because the voluminous cover of the Brazilian population could well serve
as a character for a distinct species.

Diagnosis: Size about 170 × 15 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like with acute posterior
body third, proboscis about 1/5 of body length. Two oblong macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus
in between. Contractile vacuoles absent from middle third of trunk. Extrusomes attached to right branch
of proboscis oral bulge, ampulliform, about 1.5 × 1 μm in size. On average 9 ciliary rows, 2 staggered
and differentiated into a conspicuous, isostichad dorsal brush with bristles up to 10 μm long: rows 1 and
2 composed of an average of 15 and 19 dikinetids, respectively; monokinetidal tail of row 1 extending to
second third of body and thus longer than that of row 2. Oral bulge opening about 4 × 3 μm in size. Preoral
kineties each usually composed of 2 ordinarily to widely spaced kinetids, forming a single row almost
parallel to circumoral kinety.

Description: This species was studied in two populations, namely from Benin (type) and Singapore
(voucher). They match very well (Table 43), therefore the diagnosis and description summarize all
observations. The living morphology was studied mainly in the type population.
Size 130–250 × 15–20 μm in vivo, usually about 170 × 15 μm, as calculated from some in vivo measurements
and the morphometric data (Table 43). Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like with proboscis occupying
about one fifth of body length; anterior and posterior third gradually narrowing to acute ends, posterior
end never tail-like; widest in mid-portion of trunk, anterior quarter of body flattened about 2:1, trunk
unflattened; dorsal outline curved to slightly sigmoidal (Figs 81c, p–v, 83a). Nuclear apparatus in mid of
trunk, may be dislocated by large food items (Fig. 81v). Macronuclear nodules highly variable in shape,
that is, ellipsoidal, reniform, spiralized or, very rarely, moniliform (Figs 81n, p–u, 83g; Table 44); nucleoli
large, ellipsoidal or lobate, well recognizable both in vivo and in protargol preparations. Micronucleus in
between macronuclear nodules, globular to broadly ellipsoidal, about 2 μm in size, usually surrounded
by a distinct membrane in protargol preparations (Figs 81c, n, p–v, 83g). Contractile vacuoles in dorsal
side of trunk, remarkable because lacking in mid-body, thus forming a short row each in anterior and
posterior third of trunk; one to two, rarely three intrakinetal excretory pores per vacuole (Figs 81c, o).
Extrusomes attached only to right branch of oral bulge; ampulliform and minute, that is, about 1.5 × 1 μm
in size, rather refractive and thus distinct in vivo (Figs 81a, b); developing cytoplasmic extrusomes broadly
fusiform, rarely impregnating with protargol. Cortex very flexible, contains about eight oblique granule
rows between adjacent kineties; granules narrowly spaced in somatic and oral cortex, about 0.5 × 0.3 μm
in size (Fig. 81d). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in flattened proboscis and rear end, opaque throughout
trunk due to numerous lipid droplets 1–3 μm across and food vacuoles containing naked amoebae and
fungal spores (Fig. 81v); in rear end sometimes a defecation vacuole with crystalline contents. Movement
without peculiarities.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e.,
with thick and strongly impregnated distal half, except for dorsal and tail bristles; arranged in an average
of nine ordinarily spaced, longitudinal rows leaving a barren area on left side of proboscis (Figs 81e, g, n;
Table 43). First row right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety with widely spaced cilia to tip of
proboscis (Figs 81h, 83b). Invariably only one ciliary row between perioral kinety and brush row 2 (Fig.
81h). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of two staggered, isostichad rows. Dorsal
bristles conspicuous because long and thick, that is, up to 10 × 1 μm in size. Brush row 1 commences
slightly more subapically than row 2, composed of an average of 15 loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids
each having an about 1.5 μm long anterior bristle and an up to 10 μm long posterior bristle gradually
decreasing to about 6 μm in end regions of row. Brush row 2 begins near tip of proboscis, composed of an

average of 19 loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids each associated with bristles similar to those of row
1, but anterior bristle not shortened. Both rows continue with a monokinetidal tail composed of about 1.5
μm long bristles, tail of row 1 conspicuously longer than that of row 2 and extending to second third of
body; row 2 tail composed of less than five bristles (Figs 81a, f–h, n, w, 83f).
Oral apparatus basically as in other dileptids. Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body fifth, broadly
ovate, only about 4 × 3 μm in size and thus difficult to recognize in vivo (Figs 81a, c; Table 43). Pharyngeal
basket difficult to recognize both in vivo and in protargol preparations because composed of very fine
and faintly impregnated rods. Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily to widely spaced dikinetids,
except for narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening (Figs 81e, g, h, 83b). Preoral kineties
difficult to recognize because composed of only two, rarely three widely spaced monokinetids almost in
line with left branch of circumoral kinety (Figs 81e, g, n).
Notes on post-dividers: Post-dividers differ from morphostatic cells by the smaller size (90 × 11 μm vs.
150 × 12 μm), the stouter body (8.2:1 vs. 13.5:1), and the shorter (16 μm vs. 30 μm long) and broader
proboscis, while the number of ciliary rows (8 vs. 9) and the proportion of body and proboscis length (18%
vs. 19%) is quite similar (Table 43). Early post-dividers have a fibre-like elongation of the posterior end
of the macronucleus and the dorsal brush dikinetids are very close together, especially in row 2. Further,
post-dividers are highly variable in number and pattern of the macronuclear nodules: a moniliform strand
composed of about 8 nodules; a single, highly spiralized strand; or, rarely, two ordinary macronuclear
nodules with the micronucleus in between (Figs 81i–m; Table 43).
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type locality and in a very sandy coastal soil (pH 7.0 in water)
from Singapore, Asia (Foissner 2008); in floodplain soil from Boise, Idaho, USA (Vďačný et al. 2011b);
possibly occurs also in Kenya and in the Monte Verde National Park of Costa Rica. The sample from type
locality consisted of hard, red, circumneutral (pH 7.3 in water) soil mixed with some leaf litter and grass
roots. Microdileptus microstoma was rather abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish cultures and is well
adapted to the soil environment by the very slender, highly flexible body (Vďačný & Foissner 2008b).
Remarks: Microdileptus microstoma differs from M. breviproboscis and M. semiarmatus by the shape
of the extrusomes (ampulliform vs. oblong, cuneate, or ellipsoidal) and the contractile vacuole pattern (a
dorsal row of vacuoles interrupted in mid of trunk vs. a continuous dorsal row).

Tables 44, 45)
2008 Dileptus semiarmatus nov. sp. Vďačný & Foissner, Acta Protozool. 47: 217
Diagnosis: Size about 180 × 17 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like with acute posterior
body third, proboscis about 1/5 of body length. Two oblong macronuclear nodules with a micronucleus in
between. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles. Two types of extrusomes attached to only right posterior
half of proboscis oral bulge: type I cuneate, about 2–3 × 1 μm in size; type II rod-shaped, 3 μm long.
On average 10 ciliary rows, 2 staggered and differentiated into a conspicuous, isostichad, posteriorly
heteromorphic dorsal brush with bristles up to 10 μm long: rows 1 and 2 composed of an average of 13 and
20 dikinetids, respectively; monokinetidal bristle tail of row 1 extending to second fourth of body and thus
much longer than that of row 2. Oral bulge opening about 5 × 3 μm in size, hardly broader than oral bulge.
Circumoral kinety in U-shaped pattern, composed of very widely spaced kinetids. Preoral kineties each
composed of 2 very widely spaced kinetids, forming a single row almost parallel to circumoral kinety.
Type locality: Soil from a beech forest in the surroundings (Neuhaus area) of the town of Salzburg,
Austria, E13° N47°.

Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/264) and seven paratype slides (inv. nos 2011/265–271)
with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin prefix semi (half) and the adjective armatus (armed), referring to the
extrusomes, which are restricted to the posterior half of the proboscis, a curious feature of this species.
Description: Size 130–230 × 10–25 μm, usually about 180 × 17 μm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data (Table 45). Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like, on
average about 11:1 both in vivo and in protargol preparations. Proboscis indistinct because hardly set
off from body proper and occupying only one fifth of body length; anterior and posterior end acute, i.e.,
gradually narrowed, posterior end never tail-like; dorsal outline slightly sigmoidal or concave (Figs 82a,
k–p, 83c; Table 45). Nuclear apparatus in mid of trunk. Macronuclear nodules highly variable in shape:
cylindroidal (53%), spiralized (19%), reniform (15%), ellipsoidal or ovoidal (13%; Table 44); nucleoli
small to medium-sized. Micronucleus in between macronuclear nodules, globular to broadly ellipsoidal,
about 2 μm across, usually surrounded by a distinct membrane in protargol preparations (Figs 82a, b, k–p,
83c). A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles, first vacuole slightly underneath level of oral bulge opening.
Two types of extrusomes attached to right posterior half of proboscis oral bulge (Figs 82a, h, arrows), do
not impregnate with the protargol method used: type I cuneate to narrowly cuneate, about 2–3 × 1 μm
in size; type II rod-shaped with both ends rounded, about 3 μm long (Fig. 82i). Cortical granulation not
studied. Cytoplasm colourless and hyaline in flattened proboscis, rather opaque in trunk due to numerous
lipid droplets 1–5 μm across and food vacuoles possibly containing flagellates, naked amoebae, and small
ciliates; sometimes a defecation vacuole with crystalline contents in posterior body portion. Movement
without peculiarities.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced, have the same impregnation properties as in congeners;
arranged in an average of ten ordinarily spaced, longitudinal rows leaving a rather narrow, blank stripe
left of oral bulge (Figs 82b, c, g; Table 45). First row right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety
with very loosely spaced cilia to tip of proboscis (Figs 82d, f, 83e, i). Invariably only one ciliary row
between perioral kinety and brush row 2 (Fig. 82f). Dorsal brush as described in M. microstoma, but
remarkable because heteromorphic in posterior third, where bristles are mixed with ordinary cilia. Dorsal
bristles conspicuous because about 10 μm long in central brush region, gradually decreasing in length
anteriorly and posteriorly; posterior bristle of dikinetids slightly shorter than anterior one. Tail of brush
row 1 extends to second fourth of body and is composed of up to ten bristles, tail of row 2 much shorter
or lacking (Figs 82e, g, j, 83d, e).
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body fifth, broadly elliptical and very small, i.e., about 5 × 3 μm
(Fig. 82h). Pharyngeal basket inconspicuous both in vivo and in protargol preparations because composed
of very fine and faintly impregnated rods. Oral apparatus basically dileptid, but with several strange
specializations: (i) oral bulge opening hardly broader than oral bulge, thus forming a U-shaped pattern;
(ii) circumoral kinety probably monokinetidal, that is, composed of basal bodies with similar size as
those of somatic cilia; (iii) circumoral, perioral, and preoral kinetids very widely spaced; (iv) right and
left branch of circumoral kinety comparatively widely separated, right branch curves around anterior end
of proboscis, while left branch ends subapically; (v) preoral kineties each composed of two, rarely three
monokinetids, forming minute rows almost in line with circumoral kinety (Figs 82b–d, f, g, 83h, i).
Occurrence and ecology: Microdileptus semiarmatus was rather abundant in the non-flooded Petri dish
culture from the type locality. A second population was found in soil from an oak-hornbeam forest in
Vienna, viz., in soil from the Johannser Kogel (see Foissner et al. 2005 for detailed site description;
designated as Dileptus n. sp. 1). This species is well adapted to the soil environment by the slender body.

Remarks: Microdileptus semiarmatus differs from all described dileptids in that extrusomes occur only
in the posterior half of the proboscis, a highly curious and distinct feature, which we confirmed in several
specimens from both populations to exclude the possibility that it is caused by malformed or wounded
specimens. Microdileptus semiarmatus has also two other unusual features: the oral bulge opening is
hardly broader than the oral bulge, thus forming an U-shaped pattern; and the circumoral, perioral, and
preoral kinetids are very widely spaced, a rare feature in dileptids.

Family Dileptidae Jankowski, 1980
1978 Dileptidae Jankowski, Morfologiâ, sistematika i èvolûciâ životnyh: 89 (a nomen nudum due to lack of
description or definition)
1980 Dileptidae fam. nov. Jankowski, Trudy zool. Inst., Leningr. 94: 120 (very brief characterization)
2011 Dileptidae Jankowski, 1980 – Vďačný, orsi, BourlanD, shimano, ePstein & Foissner, Eur. J. Protistol. 47:
310 (improved diagnosis)
Diagnosis: Dileptida with macronucleus in at least four moniliform or scattered nodules. Dorsal brush
typically composed of more than three rows, rarely of one or two rows. Oral apparatus dileptid or
paradileptid.
Type genus (by original designation): Dileptus DuJarDin, 1841.
Remarks: Jankowski (1980) briefly diagnosed the family as follows: “with agile proboscis different from
that of tracheliids”. Vďačný et al. (2011b) used the macronuclear pattern, the dorsal brush, and the oral
apparatus as diagnostic features. In knowledge of this monograph, the Dileptidae comprise two groups
of genera. The first group includes Dileptus and Apodileptus, which have many macronuclear nodules
scattered throughout the cytoplasm, but differ in the macronuclear division mode. In Dileptus, each nodule
divides individually, while in Apodileptus the nodules fuse in mid-dividers and the multinucleate condition
is obtained via an extensive reticulum that breaks into nodules post-divisionally.
The second group comprises four genera that share a moniliform macronucleus: Monilicaryon,
Pseudomonilicaryon, Paradileptus, and Pelagodileptus. The first two genera have a dileptid oral ciliary
pattern: the right branch of the circumoral kinety is accompanied by a single perioral kinety and the
left branch by many slightly to strongly oblique preoral kineties, which became linearly arranged in
Monilicaryon, producing a perioral-like kinety, as independently discovered by Dragesco (1972b) and
Foissner (1997a). Paradileptus and Pelagodileptus, have a paradileptid oral ciliary pattern, i.e., the right
branch of the circumoral kinety is accompanied by two perioral kineties and the left branch by many
slightly oblique preoral kineties.
Key to Genera
Proper generic classification requires knowledge of the macronuclear division mode and details of the
dorsal brush and oral ciliary pattern. Based on the macronuclear pattern, there are two groups of genera:
one with many scattered nodules and another with a moniliform strand. Life observation keys to the
species of these two groups are provided below.

be checked in protargol preparations because they differ, especially, by the dorsal brush and preoral kinety
pattern.

2008 Dileptus DuJarDin, 1841 – lynn, Ciliated protozoa: 371 (list of genera)
Nomenclature: DuJarDin (1841) established the genus Dileptus with three nominal species: Dileptus
anser (a misidentified D. margaritifer), D. folium (now Litonotus cygnus), and “Dileptus (Amphileptus
margaritifer, ehr. Infus. Pl XXXVII, fig. 5: 355)”, adopting the description from ehrenBerg (1838). He
did not fix a type species. This was done by Fromentel (1875), using D. folium. kahl (1931) overlooked
Fromentel’s typification and synonymized D. folium with Litonotus cygnus. Further, in his characterization
of Dileptus on page 205, kahl (1931) stated “typical species: D. anser”. Dragesco (1963) and Jankowski
(1967) followed. However, under the Code, D. anser cannot be considered as type species of Dileptus
because (i) the first author who subsequently designates one of the originally included nominal species
validly designates the type species of that genus or subgenus (type by subsequent designation), and no
later designation is valid (Article 69.1 of the ICZN 1999), and (ii) the term “designation” in relation
to fixation of a type species [Arts. 68, 69] must be rigidly construed (Article 67.5 of the ICZN 1999).
Thus, D. folium is the validly fixed type species of Dileptus, according to Articles 67.1.2 and 69.1 of the
ICZN (1999). Unfortunately, D. folium is a junior synonym of Litonotus cygnus, a pleurostomatid ciliate
belonging now to a different subclass, Haptoria (Vďačný et al. 2011a). Thus, recognition of Fromentel’s
forgotten typification would cause changes in many well established ciliate names. Therefore, we shall
bid the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to use its plenary power (i) to suppress
Fromentel’s (1875) typification of Dileptus, and (ii) to fix D. margaritifer as the type species of Dileptus
because it is a well-known species (see description below), matching Jankowski’s characterization of
Dileptus and having slides deposited in an international repository.
Improved diagnosis: Medium- to large-sized Dileptidae with narrow to rod-like body. Many scattered
macronuclear nodules dividing individually during ontogenesis. Dorsal brush multi-rowed. Right branch
of circumoral kinety accompanied by a perioral kinety, left branch by many slightly to strongly oblique
preoral kineties. Oral bulge opening dileptid, i.e., roundish or elliptical and located ventrally.
Type species (by subsequent designation): Dileptus folium DuJarDin, 1841. However, Amphileptus
margaritifer ehrenBerg, 1833 will be proposed to be fixed as the type species of Dileptus under the
plenary power of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (see discussion above).
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Greek numeral di (two) and the Greek
adjective leptos (thin, slender), possibly referring to the two narrowed body ends. Masculine gender.
Remarks: In this monograph, Dileptus unites thirteen species and subspecies usually having more than 50
dispersed macronuclear nodules that divide individually. Although we “cleaned” the genus by transferring
two species to Apodileptus, in which the macronuclear nodules fuse into a mass in mid-dividers, Dileptus
still contains several organization types, for instance, a species with extrusomes anchored both in the oral
bulge opening and the proboscis bulge (D. costaricanus); a species having a Spathidium-like appearance
and anterior brush tails (D. sphagnicola); and a species forming a caudal thread to attach to the substrate
(D. jonesi). On the other hand, most Dileptus species share a combination of distinct features some of
which are found, however, also in other large dileptids: (i) the right side ciliary rows are shortened only
in the anterior portion of the proboscis, (ii) the dorsal brush is multi-rowed, and (iii) the resting cysts are
globular with the wall composed of a rather thick, hyaline external layer and a thin, honey brown internal
layer, providing the cysts with a characteristic colour.

Diagnosis (type population): Length about 245 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly dileptid with short tail,
proboscis about 1/4 of body length. Possibly several scattered macronuclear nodules. A single contractile
vacuole subterminal on ventral side of cell. With symbiotic green algae (zoochlorellae). About 30–40
ciliary rows.
Type locality: Pond in the Zoological Garden of Berlin, Germany, E13°19’ N52°30’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: The Latin adjective viridis refers to the green colour of the species due to the symbiotic
algae.
Description (type population): Length about 220–270 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly dileptid with a
length:width ratio of 4.5:1, according to the figures provided. Proboscis comparatively massive (three
times longer than wide), about one fourth of body length, distinctly set off from oblong to bluntly fusiform
trunk; posterior end with short tail. Many rather large globules scattered throughout trunk, possibly
macronuclear nodules and/or food vacuoles. A single contractile vacuole described by ehrenBerg (1838)
as “a bright, contractile blister in rear body region”. Extrusomes not studied. Cytoplasm opaque and
green in trunk due to many globular symbiotic green algae about 2.5 μm in diameter, while hyaline and

colourless in proboscis and tail where zoochlorellae are absent. Creeps and swims slowly by rotating
about main body axis. ehrenBerg (1838) mentioned 15–20 ciliary rows on one side of cell (Figs 84a–c).
Notes on supposed synonym: Fromentel’s population resembles ehrenBerg’s species in having
symbiotic green algae and a short, massive proboscis, but differs by the dorsal row of contractile vacuoles
(vs. a single subterminal vacuole) and the rounded posterior body end (vs. tail-like). Thus, Fromentel’s
population possibly represents a distinct species (Fig. 84d).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i.e., in a small pond among Lemna minor.
Remarks: Within the multinucleate dileptids, D. viridis is almost unique in having symbiotic green algae,
like D. dubius. However, D. dubius has a shorter body (116 μm vs. 220–270 μm) with longer proboscis
(occupying 1/2 vs. 1/3 of body length) and a rounded posterior end (vs. short tail). The single contractile
vacuole, which ehrenBerg (1838) definitely mentioned, is possibly a misobservation. Full redescription is
required before D. viridis can be considered as a valid species.

1963 Dileptus dubius VuXanoVici, 1959 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 127 (first taxonomic reviser)
Diagnosis: Length about 116 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly dileptid with rounded posterior end, proboscis
about 1/2 of body length. Many (several?) elliptically arranged macronuclear nodules. One contractile
vacuole underneath oral bulge opening and three vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk. With symbiotic green
algae (zoochlorellae). About 24 ciliary rows.
Type locality: Coast of Lake Herǎstrǎu, Bucharest, Roumania, E26°05’ N44°28’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective dubius (doubtful) refers to VuXanoVici’s
doubts about the validity of the species.
Description: VuXanoVici’s description is based on a single specimen. Length 116 μm in vivo; slightly
contractile. Shape narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of 5:1, according to the figure provided.
Proboscis about one half of body length, distinctly set off from trunk, 7 μm wide at base and 4 μm at tip,
anterior portion curved dorsally, slightly flattened, moves to and fro like a flagellum; trunk bluntly fusiform;
posterior end rounded. Many (several?) elliptically arranged macronuclear nodules, individual nodules
oblong and only 1.5–1.8 μm long. Micronuclei not studied. Contractile vacuole pattern extraordinary,
that is, one vacuole posterior to oral bulge opening and three vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk, first dorsal
vacuole at level of ventral one. Extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge, short and fine. Cytoplasm
transparent, green due to many minute globular algae (zoochlorellae), at high magnification (×600) hyaline
in proboscis, while opaque in trunk due to numerous granules. About 12 meridionally arranged ciliary
rows on one side of cell; brush bristles about 2 μm long. Oral basket short and fine (Fig. 84e).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality in a sample containing swamp plants. Only
one specimen was observed in February 1958.
Remarks: The validity of this species may be questioned because the single specimen observed shows
several features whose combination is a property of proter post-dividers, viz., the rounded posterior end
and the comparatively short and stout body with the proboscis occupying about half of body length. Thus,
we cannot exclude that D. dubius is a junior synonym of D. viridis. VuXanoVici (1959) mentioned that
D. dubius resembles Pseudomonilicaryon falciforme which, however, lacks symbiotic algae and has a
dorsal row of contractile vacuoles commencing in mid-proboscis (vs. one ventral vacuole and three dorsal
vacuoles, the first at level of oral bulge opening). Full redescription is required.

Dileptus sphagnicola nov. sp. (Figs 85a–r, 86a–w; Tables 46, 47)
Diagnosis: Size about 450 × 70 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly to very narrowly dileptid with acute posterior
end or a short tail, proboscis rostrate and about 1/5 of body length. Many scattered macronuclear nodules
and several globular micronuclei. A dorsal and a ventral stripe of contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each.
Two types of extrusomes attached to right branch of proboscis oral bulge: type I acicular, 20 × 1.2 μm
in size; type II slightly fusiform, 4–5 × 0.3 μm in size. On average 40 ciliary rows, up to 8 anteriorly
differentiated into a staggered, distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with monokinetidal tails extending
anteriorly and posteriorly. Oral bulge opening elliptical, about 25 μm long. Preoral kineties oblique to
slightly oblique, narrowly spaced, each usually composed of 3 narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Simmelried mire near the village of Hegne, surroundings of the town of Constance,
Germany, E09°05’ N47°42’.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/301) and seventeen paratype slides (inv. nos 2011/302–
318) with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin sphagnicola (living in Sphagnum) refers to the habitat in which the species was
discovered.
Description: Dileptus sphagnicola, an outstanding, massive species, is easily recognizable in vivo due
to the large, comparatively stout body; the short, broad proboscis; the many macronuclear nodules; the
ventral and dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles; and the 20 μm long, acicular extrusomes (Figs 86a, b, c, e,
h, i). This is fortunate because it is difficult to fix and to impregnate with protargol, making morphometry
and observation of the ciliary pattern difficult. The latter problems were solved by using various fixatives
and scanning electron microscopy. The description is based on specimens from a semi-pure culture, where
D. sphagnicola reached considerable abundance at several small sites.
Size 350–650 × 55–90 μm in vivo, usually about 450 × 70 μm, as calculated from some in vivo
measurements and the morphometric data, showing 20–40% preparation shrinkage (see above and Table
47); very flexible but not contractile. Shape narrowly to very narrowly dileptid, length:width ratio near 6:1
both in vivo and in good preparations; anterior end bluntly pointed, posterior region gradually narrowed
to an acute end in about half of specimens, while tail-like set off from trunk in the other half. Proboscis
rostrate, short and stout, occupies merely one fifth of body length; indistinctly set off from trunk and thus
providing cells with a spathidiid appearance, flattened only in distal half. Trunk cylindroidal to bluntly
fusiform, not flattened (Figs 85a, f, g, i, l, n–r, 86a, b, j–m, s; Tables 46, 47). Nuclear apparatus in trunk and
proximal proboscis half, absent from tail. About 300 scattered macronuclear nodules giving cytoplasm a
smooth, opaque appearance; individual nodules globular to very narrowly ellipsoidal or, rarely, dumbbell-
shaped, about 4 × 2.5 μm in size; divide individually; usually one to two minute nucleoli in centre of
each nodule. About 11 micronuclei scattered between or attached to macronuclear nodules, 2 μm across
in protargol preparations (Figs 85a, g, 86c; Table 46). A stripe of contractile vacuoles each in ventral and
dorsal side of cell, first dorsal vacuole in mid-proboscis; invariably a single intrakinetal excretory pore
per vacuole (Figs 85a, j, 86b, j, k, m, v). Two types of extrusomes, not impregnating with protargol, in
cytoplasm and attached to right broader branch of oral bulge conspicuously concentrated in its anterior
half: type I obliquely attached, acicular, 20–22 × 1.2 μm in size, certain cytoplasmic developmental stages
(16 μm long wrinkled rods) impregnate with protargol; type II perpendicularly attached, slightly fusiform,
4–5 × 0.3 μm in size, much more numerous than type I (Figs 85a, c–e, 86c, e–i). Cortex flexible, about 1.5
µm thick and distinctly separate from cytoplasm, contains about ten rows of rod-shaped, very narrowly
spaced granules about 1.5 × 0.2 µm in size between each two kineties (Figs 85b, h, 86c, d). Cytoplasm

colourless, at low magnification (×40) bright to dark brown, depending on nutrition, sometimes green due
to prey zoochlorellae; hyaline in proboscis and rear body end, opaque in trunk due to many macronuclear
nodules, numerous food vacuoles, and lipid droplets 1–13 μm across; near posterior end sometimes a
brownish faecal mass (Figs 86a, b). Sits almost motionless in masses of organic debris, when disturbed
swims slowly but soon goes down to the bottom of the Petri dish gliding rather rapidly to and fro.
Cilia about 9 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; with same impregnation properties as in congeners;
arranged in an average of 40 ordinarily spaced rows extending meridionally to rather distinctly helically
(Figs 85f, 86j–m; Table 46); frequently with irregularities, e.g., some rows shortened anteriorly or
posteriorly, and/or with short breaks (Fig. 85k). Right side ciliary rows gradually shortened only near
anterior end of oral bulge, a feature difficult to recognize (Figs 85j–m, 86o). First row right of circumoral
kinety extends as perioral kinety with narrowly spaced cilia to tip of proboscis (Figs 85k, m). Blank
stripe on left side of proboscis comparatively short and narrow because some ciliary rows extend above
proximal half of proboscis (Figs 85k, n, 86j, m, n, t). Dorsal brush a triangular field extending on dorsal
and left side of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; composed of an average of 7 (6–8) rows
with loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids associated with 3 μm long, slightly inflated type II bristles;
frequently with irregularities, such as breaks or some extra dikinetids forming a short additional row (Figs
85j, n, 86t–w; Table 46). Some ventralmost brush rows (1–3) commence in distal proboscis third with
a monokinetidal tail of one to ten ordinary cilia, while the more dorsally located rows 4–7 (8) begin, as
usual, with dikinetidal bristles (Figs 86t, u). Posteriorly, all rows continue with 2 μm long type VI bristles

variability. The proboscis is short and comparatively stout, indistinctly set off from the oblong to bluntly fusiform trunk, thus
providing cells with an Arcuospathidium-like appearance. The posterior region is gradually narrowed to an acute end in about
half of specimens (k, l), while tail-like set off from trunk in the other half (j, m, arrows). Arrowheads denote excretory pores of
contractile vacuoles on ventral and dorsal side, an important feature because most congeners have only a dorsal stripe of vacuoles.

bristles. Posteriorly, all rows continue with 2 μm long, oblong bristles forming monokinetidal tails ending at the base of the
proboscis. Asterisk marks the short and narrow blank stripe between the preoral kineties and the dorsal brush; v, w – posterior
brush portion showing ordinary cilia and two kinds of brush kinetids with very short bristles: dikinetids with paired, slightly

elliptical or ovate in protargol and SEM preparations, possibly due to shrinkage processes (Figs 85a, d,
f, g, k, 86k–o, q, r; Table 46). Pharyngeal basket obconical, inconspicuous both in vivo and in protargol
preparations due to comparatively short fibres impregnating only in distal portion (Fig. 85k). Oral bulge
distinct due to nice metachronal ciliary waves (Figs 86n, o, q, r) and masses of short extrusomes in broader
right branch, dotted by extrusome tips in SEM micrographs (Fig. 86p). Circumoral kinety composed of
narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening.
About 50 oblique to slightly oblique, narrowly spaced preoral kineties, each composed of two to four,
usually three narrowly spaced cilia (Fig. 85k).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, i.e., in an about 70 cm wide hole filled
with Sphagnum mud to a depth of over 2 m (for details, see kreutz & Foissner 2006). A rich population
developed in a Petri dish culture with site water, crushed wheat grains, and Paramecium as a prey.

Remarks: The generic affiliation of this population may be questioned because it has several outstanding
features, viz., the massive, Arcuospathidium-like body; the long (20 μm!), acicular extrusomes; the
anterior tails in the rightmost brush rows; and the comparatively short, narrow blank stripe on the left
side of the proboscis. Nevertheless, we assign the German population to Dileptus because of the many
macronuclear nodules which divide individually and the oral ciliary pattern. If molecular data show
comparable differences, the species should be referred to a new genus.
Within the group of large, multinucleate dileptids, D. sphagnicola resembles D. costaricanus and D.
anatinus in having a stripe of contractile vacuoles each in ventral and dorsal side of body. However, D.
costaricanus has a much smaller body (280 × 40 μm vs. 450 × 70 μm) and extrusomes anchored both in
the proboscis oral bulge and in the oral bulge opening (vs. only in proboscis bulge). Dileptus anatinus
has different extrusomes (rod-shaped and 12 μm long vs. acicular and 20 μm long) and a larger, less stout
body (800–1200 μm × 100–120 μm vs. 350–650 × 55–90 μm) with the proboscis occupying one third or
more of body length (33–50% vs. 17–25%). Beginners may confuse D. sphagnicola with Monilicaryon
monilatum, which has a similar size and shape (very short proboscis!). However, M. monilatum has a
moniliform macronucleus and lacks ventral contractile vacuoles. Further, it is usually much more slender
(~ 10:1 vs. 6:1).

Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 1997/96) and one paratype slide (inv. no. 1997/97) with
protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper
Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Gene sequence: The 18S rRNA gene sequence of a Botswanan population has been deposited in GenBank
(HM581679). The sequence is 1641 nucleotides long and has a GC content of 41.7%. It is a consensus
sequence based on 21 clones.
Etymology: Named after the country where it was discovered.
Description of Costa Rican population: Size 200–340 × 35–60 μm in vivo, usually about 280 × 45 μm,
as calculated from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming 10% preparation
shrinkage; very flexible but not contractile (Table 48). Shape narrowly dileptid, i.e., length:width ratio
near 5:1 both in vivo and after protargol impregnation. Proboscis about one third of body length, leaf-
like flattened, stout and indistinctly set off from trunk, providing cells with an Arcuospathidium-like
appearance; trunk oblong to bluntly fusiform; posterior end rounded in specimens collected from the
young non-flooded Petri dish culture, while acute, but never tail-like in most cells found in the old culture
(Figs 87b, j, m; Table 48). Nuclear apparatus in trunk and proximal third of proboscis. About 150–500
scattered macronuclear nodules, difficult to count since narrowly spaced and of similar size as some
cytoplasmic inclusions; individual nodules highly variable, that is, globular to oblong and 3–7 × 2.5–3 μm
in size; few to many nucleoli. Many micronuclei scattered between or attached to macronuclear nodules,
about 2 μm across in protargol preparations (Fig. 87m; Table 48). A stripe of contractile vacuoles each in
ventral and dorsal side of cell, first dorsal vacuole in mid-proboscis, ventral stripe commences slightly
posterior to oral bulge opening; invariably a single intrakinetal excretory pore per vacuole (Figs 87b,
j–l). Two types of extrusomes, not impregnating with protargol and scattered throughout cytoplasm: type
I obliquely attached with thin end to both oral bulge branches, clavate and curved, 5–7 × 1 μm in size;
type II forms a conspicuous ring in oral bulge opening, anchored with thick end to bulge cortex, narrowly
obovate and only slightly curved, about 3 × 1 μm in size (Figs 87b, d–f, n–q). Cortex flexible, contains
about five granule rows between adjacent kineties; granules colourless and ~ 1 × 0.5 μm in size (Figs
87g, h). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in proboscis, opaque in trunk because packed with 3–8 μm-sized
lipid droplets and food vacuoles with indiscernible contents, possibly ciliates; in posterior end of trunk
sometimes a defecation vacuole with sparse contents.
Cilia about 10 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced, arranged in about 38 narrowly spaced rows (Table 48).
Right side rows gradually shortened along oral bulge; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with
ordinarily spaced basal bodies (Figs 87j, l). Blank stripe on left side of proboscis comparatively short
and narrow because most ciliary rows extend to distal half of proboscis (Figs 87j–l). Dorsal brush a long,
narrow field on dorsal and dorsolateral region of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; composed
of about six rows with loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids associated with type II bristles both being
2–3 μm long. All brush rows continue with a monokinetidal tail extending to base of proboscis with 1–2
μm long type VI bristles; an anterior tail common in some rows (Figs 87a, b, j, k).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, hardly projecting because base of proboscis
almost as wide as trunk, roundish both in vivo and in preparations, about 10 μm across (Figs 87b, d, j, l).
Pharyngeal basket obconical, inconspicuous (Figs 87b, l). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily to
narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening.
About 35 oblique, ordinarily spaced preoral kineties, as estimated from figures, each usually composed of
three, rarely two narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 87j, l).
Resting cyst (Botswanan population): Mature cysts about 80 μm across in vivo, globular to rotund and
flattened 2:1, a peculiar feature as yet not found in any other dileptid cyst; honey yellow; without escape
280

apparatus; does not break when strongly pressed by coverslip because the wall is very tough (Figs 87c,
r–u; Table 48). Cyst wall composed of two distinct layers: external layer up to 5 μm thick, hyaline and
colourless, somewhat granular, becomes thicker and denser in old cysts; internal layer only 1–1.5 μm
thick, honey brown, compact (Figs 87c, s, v). Cyst covered by an up to 60 μm thick, hyaline, colourless
mucous layer well recognizable due to adhering bacteria and debris (Figs 87c, r, s, t, v). Cytoplasm packed
with 3–6 μm-sized macronuclear nodules, extrusomes, and granules up to 2 μm across (Fig. 87c).
Notes on supposed German population: DingFelDer (1962) described a “magna-form of Dileptus
margaritifer”, which highly resembles D. costaricanus in several important features, such as body shape and
the peculiar extrusome pattern (Fig. 87i). On the other hand, the German and the Costa Rican populations
differ so strongly in body length (670–846 μm vs. 200–340 μm) that conspecificity can be excluded. Thus,
the German population, which DingFelDer (1962) found year-round in meadow rainwater puddles from
the surroundings of the town of Forchheim, Germany, very likely represents a distinct species.
Occurrence and ecology: Dileptus costaricanus was discovered in a tropical dry forest, viz., in the upper
soil layer from the Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica, where it occurred together with Rimaleptus
similis. The population was rather weak but present for four weeks. Further records: soil from a woodruff-
beech forest in the surroundings of the town of Vienna, Austria (Foissner et al. 2005); floodplain soil from
Botswana (see resting cyst); and Amazon floodplain soil from the surroundings of the town of Manaus,
Brazil. All populations were highly similar.
Remarks: Dileptus costaricanus is peculiar in having extrusomes anchored both to the proboscis oral
bulge and to the oral bulge opening, while all congeners have them attached only to the proboscis bulge;
in this respect, D. costaricanus resembles Pseudomonilicaryon falciforme, a species with moniliform
macronucleus, and the binucleate Rimaleptus canadensis. Another rare feature of Dileptus costaricanus
is the ventral and dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles, a pattern found only in three other multinucleate
species, viz., D. anatinus, D. dubius, and D. sphagnicola. Dileptus anatinus is much larger (1000 × 110
μm vs. 280 × 40 μm) and has rod-shaped extrusomes (vs. clavate). Dileptus dubius possesses only one
ventral contractile vacuole underneath the oral bulge opening (vs. a ventral stripe) and is considerably
smaller (116 μm vs. 280 μm). Dileptus sphagnicola is distinctly larger (450 × 70 μm vs. 280 × 40 μm) and
has different extrusomes (acicular and 20 μm long vs. clavate and 5–7 μm long).

Improved diagnosis (based on literature and the population from Austria mentioned above): Size about
1000 × 110 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly dileptid to rod-like with acute or tail-like posterior region,
proboscis about 37% of body length. More than 200 scattered macronuclear nodules and several globular
micronuclei. A dorsal and a ventral stripe of contractile vacuoles. Two types of extrusomes attached to
right branch of proboscis oral bulge: type I rod-shaped, 10–12 μm long; type II oblong, 3–4 µm long. Oral
bulge opening roundish. Preoral kineties slightly oblique, narrowly spaced, each composed of 5 narrowly
spaced cilia.
Type locality: Small pond in Zaborów near Warsaw, Poland, E20°40’ N52°15’.

Etymology: Not given in original description. Possibly, the specific epiteth anatinus (duck, waterfowl)
refers to the similarity with D. anser, as the Latin noun anser means goose.
Description: Dileptus anatinus is difficult to impregnate with protargol, making morphometry and
observation of the ciliary pattern difficult. We solved the latter problem by using scanning electron
microscopy. The description is based on Polish specimens from a thriving semi-pure culture (golińska
1971) and Austrian specimens from an ephemeral meadow puddle in Salzburg, Austria (Foissner et al.
1995 and some unpublished data). The populations match very well, therefore the diagnosis and description
combine all observations; live data are mainly from the Salzburg specimens.
Size in vivo fairly similar in the two populations investigated: Polish specimens 990–1200 μm long and
Austrian cells 600–1000 × 70–120 μm, showing 20–40% preparation shrinkage in protargol preparations
(see Table 49); very flexible and contractile by about 10%. Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like,
that is, length:width ratio 4–11:1 according to in vivo micrographs, while only 4.4–6.7:1 in protargol
preparations due to strong shrinkage of body length. Proboscis about one third to one half of body length,
slightly rostrate, that is, comparatively stout and indistinctly set off from trunk providing cells with an
Arcuospathidium-like appearance; trunk massive and cylindroidal with a tendency to fold (Figs 89n,
r), in well-fed specimens fusiform; posterior end acute or usually with short tail recognizable also in
specimens inflated by food inclusions (Figs 88f, m–u, 89a, b, h, j–m). Nuclear apparatus in trunk and
base of proboscis, absent from tail. About 200–500 scattered macronuclear nodules; individual nodules
highly variable, that is, globular to oblong and 4–10 × 3–4 μm in size; divide individually (golińska
1971); many small, globular nucleoli in each nodule. Several micronuclei scattered between or attached

to macronuclear nodules, about 1.5 μm across in vivo (Figs 88i, 89d, u). A stripe of contractile vacuoles
each in ventral and dorsal side of cell: ventral stripe commences slightly posterior to oral bulge opening
and is composed of 5–15 vacuoles, dorsal stripe begins subapically and is composed of 20–35 vacuoles
(Figs 88f, 89a, b, h–u). Two types of extrusomes attached only to broader right branch of oral bulge: type I
rod-shaped with slightly narrowed, rounded ends, slightly asymmetric, 10–12 μm long, when exploded up
to 50 μm long and of typical toxicyst structure, i.e., with a refractive granule at tip of tube emerging from
empty capsule (Figs 88c, e, g, 89f, g, u); type II oblong, 3–4 µm long; developing extrusomes of various
stages about 5 µm long, each enveloped in a vacuole (Fig. 88d). Cortex flexible, about 2 µm thick and
distinctly separated from cytoplasm, contains about six oblique granule rows between each two kineties;
granules narrowly spaced in somatic and oral bulge cortex, oblong, comparatively large, i.e., about 2
× 0.3 µm in size and thus easily mistaken for type II extrusomes in oral bulge, when exploded form a
conspicuous spongious cover (Figs 88b, g, h, 90b–d). Cytoplasm colourless, at low magnification (×40)
bright to dark brown, depending on nutrition; hyaline in proboscis and tail, opaque in trunk due to many

macronuclear nodules and numerous food vacuoles containing heterotrophic flagellates and euglenids in
Austrian cells; near posterior end sometimes a defecation vacuole (Figs 88f, 89a, b, h–u).
Cilia about 9 μm long in vivo; number of ciliary rows not studied by golińska (1971), about 46–66
meridionally to rather distinctly helically extending rows in Austrian specimens (Figs 90a, e, f; Table 49).
Right side rows very likely shortened only near anterior end of oral bulge and thus not leaving a blank
stripe right of oral bulge; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with narrowly spaced basal bodies
(Figs 88k, 90h, k). Blank stripe on left side of proboscis comparatively short and narrow because most
ciliary rows extend to or above proximal half of proboscis (Figs 88l, 90e–g, i, j, l). Dorsal brush on dorsal
and dorsolateral region of proboscis; multi-rowed, i.e., composed of at least 12 distinctly heterostichad
rows with loosely spaced dikinetids associated with type I bristles: anterior bristle clavate and up to 3 μm
long in vivo (1.5–2 µm in SEM), posterior bristle stump-like and about 1–1.5 μm long in vivo (0.6–0.8 µm
in SEM). All rows continue with a monokinetidal tail of type VI bristles 0.6–0.8 µm long in SEM (Figs
88a, l, 90g, i, j, l).

30 µm across (Figs 88f, g, 89a, b, h, k, m, o, q, s–u, 90a, b, f, k; Table 49). Pharyngeal basket obconical
and comparatively long. Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and
narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening. Preoral kineties slightly oblique, narrowly
spaced, each composed of five narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 88k, l, 90h–l).
Resting cyst (Austrian population): Cysts conspicuous because about 170 μm across in vivo and globular
to rotund, dark at low magnification (×40), yellowish brown at higher magnification, without escape
apparatus. Cyst wall composed of two distinct layers: external layer abou 20 μm thick, yellowish, with
distinct lamination; internal layer about 5 μm thick, honey brown, compact. Cyst wall covered by an up
to 50 μm thick, colourless mucous layer becoming recognizable due to adhering bacteria, flagellates and
debris; fragile and thus easily lost when cysts are transferred onto the slide. Cytoplasm colourless, studded
with globules 1–5 μm across (Figs 88j, 89c, e). Unfortunately, we did not note whether the macronuclear
nodules remain separate or fuse.
Occurrence and ecology: Dileptus anatinus was discovered in a small pond with low water level due
to a prolonged draught in the town of Zaborów near Warsaw, Poland. It grew well in Petri dish cultures
with tap water or Pringsheim’s solution as a medium and Colpidium and Tetrahymena as a prey (golińska
1971). Foissner et al. (1995) found Dileptus anatinus in a shallow, eutrophic meadow puddle near the so-
called Henkerhaus in the Donnersberg Park (a municipal park near Salzburg city centre).
Remarks: Dileptus anatinus is difficult to preserve and to impregnate with protargol, making observations
on the ciliary pattern difficult as already mentioned by golińska (1971). However, it is easily recognizable
in vivo due to the large, massive body; the more than 200 scattered macronuclear nodules; the ventral and
dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles; and the 12 μm long, rod-shaped extrusomes (Figs 88a, b, g).
Dileptus anatinus is most similar to D. costaricanus and D. sphagnicola in having a stripe of contractile
vacuoles each in ventral and dorsal side of body. However, D. costaricanus is much smaller (280 × 40
μm vs. 1000 × 110 μm) and has clavate extrusomes (vs. rod-shaped) anchored to the proboscis oral bulge.
Dileptus sphagnicola is smaller (350–650 × 55–90 μm vs.800–1200 μm × 100–120 μm) and has 20 (vs.
12 μm) μm long, acicular (vs. rod-shaped) extrusomes.

1963 Dileptus multinucleatus VuXanoVici, 1959 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 125 (first taxonomic reviser)
Diagnosis: Length about 185 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly dileptid with acute posterior end, proboscis
about 1/3 of body length. Many scattered macronuclear nodules and several micronuclei. Two contractile
vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk. About 20 ciliary rows.
Type locality: Coast of Lake Herǎstrǎu, Bucharest, Roumania, E26°05’ N44°28’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Latin numeral multi and the noun nucleus,
obviously referring to the many macronuclear nodules.
Description: VuXanoVici’s description is based on a single specimen. Length 185 μm in vivo; slightly
contractile. Shape narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of 5.5:1, according to the figure provided.
Proboscis ordinary, about one third of body length, distinctly set off from trunk; trunk bluntly fusiform;
posterior region gradually narrowed to an acute end. Many small macronuclear nodules and several
micronuclei scattered in trunk. Two contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk: anterior vacuole slightly
posterior of oral bulge opening, posterior vacuole subterminal. Extrusomes not studied. Cytoplasm
transparent, yellowish. About ten meridionally arranged ciliary rows on one side of cell (Fig. 84f).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality in a sample containing swamp plants. Only
one specimen was observed in January 1958.
Remarks: Poorly described, thus needing complete redescription. The main distinguishing feature of D.
multinucleatus is the two contractile vacuoles in the dorsal side of the trunk, a pattern as yet not found in
any other congener.
The Dileptus margaritifer group
The seven species and subspecies collected in this group look very similar at first glance because they have
a slender, medium to large-sized body, a dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles, and a multi-rowed dorsal
brush. However, on more detailed investigation considerable differences become obvious (Table 50).
Reliable identification requires careful in vivo observation and silver preparations.

10:1, according to Dragesco’s figures. Proboscis short and stout, occupies one fifth to third of body
length, indistinctly set off from trunk and thus providing cells with a spathidiid appearance; trunk massive,
cylindroidal, slightly flattened, with a tendency to fold; posterior end with short but distinct tail (Figs 90m,
n). About 70–80 scattered macronuclear nodules, individual nodules globular to oblong, comparatively
large, i.e., about 8 μm across; several small nucleoli in each nodule. About 30 micronuclei scattered
between macronuclear nodules, 0.6–0.8 μm across in methyl green stains (Fig. 90p). A stripe of 12–30
contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of proboscis and trunk. Extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge
and scattered throughout cytoplasm; their shape not described but figured as slightly curved rods (Figs
90m–o). Cortex with many refractive granules between adjacent kineties. Cytoplasm transparent, packed
with macronuclear nodules, extrusomes, food vacuoles, lipid droplets 1–13 μm across, and innumerable
bacterial rods (endosymbionts?); near posterior end sometimes a defecation vacuole. Swims slowly
hardly moving the proboscis. About 40 meridionally arranged ciliary rows. Oral bulge opening hardly
projecting because base of proboscis almost as wide as trunk. Pharyngeal basket obconical, inconspicuous
as composed of comparatively short and fine fibres (Figs 90m–o).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at type locality, where it was rather abundant; in the interstitium
of the Øresund in Denmark (Fenchel 1968); and in the western Baltic Sea (telesh et al. 2008).
Remarks: Dileptus estuarinus differs from all other multinucleate dileptids, except for D. sphagnicola,
in having a very short to short proboscis. However, D. sphagnicola has a much smaller body (350–650
μm vs. 800–1100 μm), a different contractile vacuole pattern (a dorsal and a ventral row vs. a dorsal row
only), and a much higher number of macronuclear nodules (about 300 vs. 70–80). Another similar species
is Monilicaryon monilatum which possesses, however, a moniliform macronucleus.

Nomenclature and taxonomy: Dileptus margaritifer was originally described as Amphileptus margaritifer
by ehrenBerg (1833). Eight years later, it was combined with the genus Dileptus by DuJarDin (1841). As
mentioned by hayes (1938), it is apparent from the descriptions and illustrations provided by Prowazek
(1904), Visscher (1923, 1927a, b) and stuDitsky (1930) that these authors considered D. gigas (now
Monomacrocaryon gigas) as a synonym of D. margaritifer. Since kahl (1931), D. margaritifer was usually
misidentified as D. anser which has, however, a much longer proboscis and a moniliform macronucleus
with only 10–20 nodules. According to schewiakoFF (1896) and kahl (1931), Dileptus margaritifer has
two further synonyms: D. gigas varsaviensis wrześniowski, 1870 and Amphileptus irregularis Maskell,
1887; we agree. Dragesco (1963) and Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis (1968) proposed a further synonym:
D. beersi Jones, 1956 which differs, inter alia, in the shape of the extrusomes (very narrowly ovate vs. rod-
shaped), a feature definitely mentioned and illustrated by Jones (1956). Foissner et al. (1995) speculated
that D. jonesi Dragesco, 1963 may be another synonym of D. margaritifer. However, D. jonesi has far fewer
macronuclear nodules, ciliary rows, and forms a caudal thread, an outstanding feature never found in D.
margaritifer as emphasized by Dragesco (1963). Considering the difficulties in separating D. margaritifer
from D. jonesi and D. beersi, the species should be neotypified from a European population.
As concerns the other populations listed in the synonymy, most important features match: body narrowly to
very narrowly dileptid, usually 450 × 50 μm in size, proboscis 1/3 to 1/2 of body length, tail distinct, many

scattered macronuclear nodules, contractile vacuoles in a dorsal stripe. At the present state of knowledge,
it appears wise to consider them as conspecific, especially because data on the extrusomes and the number
of ciliary rows are usually lacking.
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size of environmental specimens about 400 ×
50 μm in vivo, in cultures up to 1000 μm. Shape narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with distinct tail,
proboscis 1/3 to 1/2 of body length. At least 200 scattered macronuclear nodules and several globular
micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each. Two types of extrusomes attached
to proboscis oral bulge: type I rod-shaped with slightly narrowed ends, about 10 × 0.7 μm in size; type II
oblong, about 3 μm long. On average 46 ciliary rows, up to 12 anteriorly differentiated into a staggered,
distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with monokinetidal tails extending to second third of body. Oral
bulge opening about 30 μm across. Preoral kineties oblique, ordinarily to narrowly spaced, each usually
composed of 4 narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Pond in the Zoological Garden of Berlin, Germany, E13°19’ N52°30’.
Type and voucher material: No type material is available from ehrenBerg’s specimens. Foissner et
al. (1995) deposited six voucher slides (inv. nos 2011/330–335) with protargol-impregnated specimens
in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI; deposition not mentioned in the 1995
monograph). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Latin noun margarita (pearl ~ contractile
vacuole) and the Latin suffix fer (carrying), referring to the dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles.
Description: All known and some new data are put together because the morphological conspecificity is
beyond reasonable doubts for most populations mentioned in the list of synonyms. In spite of the many

studies available, detailed data on D. margaritifer are rare. Thus, the review must emphasize our own data
from an African population first published by Foissner et al. (1995).
Size in vivo similar in most environmental populations, usually about 400 × 50 μm: type specimens
365 μm long on average (ehrenBerg 1833, 1838), French specimens 200–400 × 50–100 μm (DuJarDin
1841), Russian cells 470–600 × 48–57 μm (schewiakoFF 1889, 1896), German cells usually 250–400 μm,
rarely up to 600 μm long (kahl 1931, wenzel 1953, Bick 1972), North American specimens 200–600 ×
30–40 μm (Visscher 1927b, hayes 1938, Dumont 1961), Roumanian exemplar 320 μm long (VuXanoVici
1959), Moldavian specimen 375 μm long (chorik 1968), and African cells 250–600 × 40–70 μm in size
(Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis 1986, Foissner et al. 1995). Postdividers or rapidly dividing specimens
only 100–155 × 40–50 μm in size (hayes 1938), possibly explaining the small individuals (100–200
μm) observed by DuJarDin (1841), maskell (1887), mermoD (1914), DingFelDer (1962) and matis
(1977). wrześniowski’s (1870) specimens remarkably large, viz., 605–935 μm long, which matches our
observations from the African population, where specimens reached 1 mm long.
Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape in vivo narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid, that is, length:width
ratio on average 7:1 (4.5–12:1), according to the figures available in the literature and our own data based
on micrographs and protargol preparations with Foissner’s method, while 8.6–18.2:1 in preparations made
with Wilbert’s method, which caused strong shrinkage of body width (Table 51). Proboscis one third
to one half of body length, slightly flattened, highly motile and flexible. Trunk cylindroidal to bluntly
fusiform, unflattened, usually widest in mid-portion rarely in distal third. Posterior end with short or long
tail preserved also in prepared cells and even in specimens inflated by food inclusions (Figs 91a–i, k–r,
92a, e, f, u, v, w, 93a, g, 94a–e, j, t).
Many macronuclear nodules and several micronuclei scattered in trunk and proximal third of proboscis,
absent from tail. Macronuclear nodules difficult to count because numerous and of similar size as some
cytoplasmic inclusions (Figs 92a, c, e, f, u, v, 94g, j, k, m, s): several hundreds to several thousands
(Visscher 1927b), 180–400 in German specimens (stuDitsky 1930), over 200 in North American cells
(hayes 1938), about 500 to 800 in Benin specimens (Fig. 94j), and 200–500 nodules according to Dragesco
(1963). maskell (1887) misinterpreted a defecation or food vacuole as a macronucleus, as evident from
his illustration (Fig. 91l) and description: “nucleus globular, close to the posterior extremity”, a pattern not
found in any other species. Individual nodules highly variable in size and shape: globular to ellipsoidal,
0.1–1 μm across in Visscher’s specimens (likely a mistake), about 5 μm across in hayes’ specimens,
and 7 × 4 μm on average in Benin cells (Table 51). During cell division, each nodule divides by forming
an enormously elongated, distinctly nodulated strand (Fig. 92i), as observed by calkins (1926, 1933),
stuDitsky (1930), and hayes (1938). Nodules may divide also in vegetative specimens (hayes 1938), first
increasing in size and becoming dumbbell-shaped before separating into two oblong pieces (Figs 92j–l).
One central nucleolus in each nodule of Polish cells (golińska 1971), while several nucleoli in African
specimens (Fig. 94k). After Feulgen stain, chromatin as a cup over one half of nodule, as bands in irregular
pattern over the nodule surface, or as irregular masses (hayes 1938; Figs 92m, n). Micronuclei globular,
inconspicuous both in vivo and in preparations (Fig. 94k): about 0.3–1.2 μm across according to Dragesco
(1963), while 1.7–3.0 μm in Benin specimens after protargol impregnation (Table 51); surrounded by
a distinct membrane in Feulgen stains (hayes 1938); often difficult to distinguish from similarly sized
and stained cytoplasmic inclusions or small macronuclear nodules, number thus difficult to determine:
approximately 20 (hayes 1938), while 6–12 according to Dragesco (1963).
Contractile vacuole pattern fairly similar in all populations mentioned in the synonymy list, viz., a dorsal
stripe usually composed of usually more than 10 (4–20) vacuoles; no ventral vacuoles. First vacuole
usually slightly anterior to level of oral bulge opening, in Dragesco’s specimens also subapically and in
298

mid-proboscis. Number of excretory pores known only in Benin specimens, viz., one intrakinetal pore per
vacuole (Figs 91a–f, h, i, l, m, o, q, r, 92a, e, f, u, v, w, 93a, 94a, r).
Extrusomes of toxicyst type, as speculated by Visscher (1923) and later confirmed by TEM studies
(Dumont 1961, grain & golińska 1969). Toxicysts studded in broader right branch of oral bulge in
Polish and Benin specimens (Figs 91j, 93d, i, 94o, p), while in both bulge branches in North American and
Russian cells (Figs 92d, y), which is either a misobservation or an indication that these populations could
be a different taxon. Shape and size studied only by us, but Visscher (1923) already recognized two types
in preparations (Figs 92q, r). Type I rod-shaped with slightly narrowed ends, 9–12 × 0.5–0.8 μm in size;
type II oblong, only 2–3 μm long and thus easily overlooked, more numerous than type I (Figs 93c, f, 94l,
n, s). kahl (1931), additionally, figured a ring of extrusomes (granules?) in the oral bulge opening, but
did not mention this in the description (Fig. 91o). Developing toxicysts scattered throughout cytoplasm,
of similar shape and size as oral bulge ones (Figs 94k, o, p, s). Toxicysts become swollen and tripartrite
when fixed in Schaudinn’s fluid and stained with acid fuchsin (Fig. 92s): neck, bulb, and terminal thread.
Ultrastructure not yet studied in detail (Dumont 1961).
Cortex flexible, slightly furrowed by ciliary rows in SEM micrographs, contains about eight rows of
very narrowly spaced, 1 µm-long, highly refractive granules between each two kineties (Figs 92x, 93e,
94f, r, t–y); granules of mucocyst type according to TEM studies (grain & golińska 1969). Silverline
pattern composed of very small polygonal meshes about 0.5 μm in size, not yet studied in detail (Fig. 8g).
Cytoplasm colourless; hyaline in proboscis and tail, opaque in trunk due to many food vacuoles. Often
a defecation vacuole near base of tail, contains crystalline and granular material, empties ventrally (Fig.
91h). Movement slow, frequently restricted to the proboscis; spirals clockwise, about one rotation/length
of body; ventral ciliature more active when swimming, dorsal ciliature more active during backward
swimming after strong disturbance (luDwig 1929).
Cilia about 10 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e.,
with thick, strongly impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles. Ciliary rows narrowly spaced, with
longitudinal to slightly helical course, number studied only in African populations, viz., 42–46 according
to Dragesco (1963) and Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis (1986) and 40–50 according to Foissner et al.
(1995; Figs 93g, 94t; Table 51). Details of ciliary pattern available only from golińska (1971) and Foissner
et al. (1995): (i) right side rows not shortened or only near anterior end of oral bulge, a feature difficult
to recognize (Fig. 93g); (ii) first row right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety with narrowly
spaced cilia to tip of proboscis (Figs 92g, 93g–i, 94o, p); (iii) left side of proboscis with conspicuous
blank stripe because several ciliary rows terminate slightly above oral bulge opening (Figs 92h, 93h–j,
94g, x). Dorsal brush already recognized by quennersteDt (1869), forms a rather wide field on dorsal
and dorsolateral area of proboscis, staggered, distinctly heterostichad, composed of up to twelve rows.
First brush row begins usually in second third of proboscis, while last row commences subapically (Figs
93j, 94g, t). Brush dikinetids loosely to ordinarily spaced, associated with type II bristles: anterior bristles
about 3 μm long in vivo (1.5 μm in SEM), posterior bristles gradually decreasing in length from about 1.3
μm to 0.7 μm (SEM measurements) becoming a conical stump in posterior dikinetidal brush region (Figs
93b, 94z). All rows continue with a monokinetidal tail extending to second third of body with type VI
bristles 2–2.5 μm long in vivo (0.9–1.5 μm in SEM; Figs 93b, 94r, t, x, z).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, projects distinctly because proboscis only half as
wide as trunk, about 30 μm across in vivo, ovate to broadly ovate in Polish, North American, and Benin
specimens, while narrowly elliptical in cells prepared with Wilbert’s protargol method, a conspicuous
artefact possibly occurring also in other species prepared with that method (cp. Figs 91j, n, 92d, o, p,
y, 93d, g, 94u, y with Fig. 93h). Pharyngeal basket obconical, distinct both in vivo and in protargol

Fig. 95w: Scheme of the nuclear processes during and after conjugation of D. margaritifer (from Visscher 1927b).
There are three maturation and three synkaryon divisions, which produce four macronuclear anlagen and four
new micronuclei. The macronuclear anlagen divide amitotically, while the micronuclei divide mitotically until the
vegetative nuclear pattern is obtained. I, II, III – maturation divisions, 1–3 – synkaryon divisions, A – macronuclear
anlagen, MI – micronuclei, PN – pronuclei, S – synkaryon. Crosses mark degenerating maturation derivatives.
were excellently described by Visscher (1927b), using cultivated specimens from the Creve Coeur Lake
near St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Both processes are similar to those described for Rimaleptus tirjakovae
(Vďačný & Foissner 2008a) and Pseudomonilicaryon thononense (present study), however, with some
variation.
There are two preconjugation divisions making the cells distinctly shorter (175 μm) than vegetative
specimens (400 μm). The union mode is temporary. Pair formation is heteropolar, and the partners unite
bulge-to-bulge with the proboscis (Fig. 95a). During the initial stages, the proboscis shortens markedly
providing maturating conjugants with an Enchelyodon- or Protospathidium-like appearence, i.e., they
resemble “polar” haptorids without proboscis (Figs 95b–f). After synkaryon formation, which occurs
about twelve hours after union, the shape of the partners becomes Spathidium-like, and subsequently they
separate (Fig. 95g). About twelve hours after separation, the vegetative body shape is regained, while
attainment of the vegetative size takes about four days.
The nuclear processes are as follows (Fig. 95w): (i) several micronuclei move into the anterior portion of
the trunk and conspicuously increase in size but only one of them enters the first maturation division (Figs
95b, c); (ii) the second maturation division generates four maturation derivatives that start to degenerate,
except for one which undergoes the third maturation division producing two pronuclei (Figs 95d–g); (iii)
a synkaryon each is formed in the partners by fusion of the migratory pronucleus with the stationary one;
(iv) there are three synkaryon divisions producing four macronuclear anlagen and four new micronuclei
(Figs 95h–o); (v) the macronuclear anlagen and the micronuclei divide until the vegetative nuclear pattern
is obtained (Figs 95p–v); (vi) in early conjugants, the vegetative macronuclear nodules migrate into the
308

posterior part of the body and degenerate. The resorption of the nodules is completed about two days after
separation of the partners (Figs 95b–g, i–n); (vii) unlike in Rimaleptus tirjakovae, there are no degenerating
synkaryon derivatives and the degenerating macronuclear nodules do not fuse.
Notes on ontogenesis (see also general part): The formation of the opisthe’s infraciliature was studied
by golińska (1995), using transmission electron microscopy and protargol impregnation. Basically, the
process agrees with data from Monomacrocaryon terrenum recently published by Vďačný & Foissner
(2009): (i) stomatogenesis is holotelokinetal; (ii) small anarchic fields, formed at the anterior end of the
broken ciliary rows, develop into circumoral kinetofragments growing and uniting as the circumoral kinety;
(iii) the ventral circumoral kinetofragments are composed of monokinetids, while the kinetofragments
originating from the lateral and dorsal kineties are composed of dikinetids; (iv) all oral fibres are at first
directed anteriorly, later on they orientate towards the centre of the oral bulge opening; (v) the perioral
kinety is formed by alignment of the densely ciliated anterior region of the right side ciliary rows; (vi)
the preoral kineties are produced by splitting of the anterior region of the dorsal and some left side ciliary
rows into several minute pieces that migrate rightwards along the circumoral kinety; (vii) the dorsal brush
develops after the production of the preoral kineties.
Occurrence and ecology (mainly from Foissner et al. 1995): Pure cultures of Dileptus margaritifer can
be obtained with tap water or Pringsheim’s solution as a medium and Colpidium colpoda and/or a species
of the Tetrahymena pyriformis complex as food. The washed food organisms are added daily. For review
and references on how to cultivate the food ciliates, see Chapter 9.1.3. Cultivation.
In most studies, this species is called Dileptus anser because the determination usually followed kahl
(1931). Dileptus margaritifer occurs year-round with frequency peaks in spring (Fig. 96); common but
rarely abundant in organic mud and between algae and water plants of eutrophic puddles and ponds
(lieBmann 1962, Bick & kunze 1971); rare in plankton (e.g., korniyenko 1972, BeaVer & crisman
1989). Also in ephemeral habitats, such as shallow meadow puddles, rainwater pools (DingFelDer 1962,
DetcheVa 1972), mosses (Bryum argenteum, Ceratodon purpureus, and Brachythecium albicans) and
soil, showing the ability to produce resting cysts (Foissner et al. 1995, anDeloVá & tirJakoVá 2000). Rare
in activated sludge plants (marco et al. 1991), percolating filters (curDs 1975), and rotating biological
contactors (maDoni 1981). Eurytherm (gaJewskaJa 1933), but a large data set from German rivers suggests
a preference for cold water (Fig. 96). The Upper temperature limit is 25 °C according to Bick & Bertram
(1973). However, gittleson & Ferguson (1971) found D. margaritifer in relatively hot waters (15–17 °C),
and matis & strakoVá-strieŠkoVá (1991) reported it from thermal waters of Slovakia at 19–42 °C and
pH 5–6.8. Rapid cooling from room temperature to 3 °C does not cause encystment (rammelmeyer 1931).
agamalieV (1986) reported it from freshwater and brackish bays (0.2–0.34% salinity) of the Caspian Sea;

Dumitrache (2003) from the psammon of the Black Sea; krieg (2000) from brackish water (Isebekkanal)
in Hamburg, Germany; and telesh et al. (2008) from the eastern Baltic Sea. alBrecht (1984) classified
D. margaritifer as a holoeuryhaline freshwater species on base of literature data and his investigations
of oversalted rivers in Germany (salinity 0 to > 3%); Patterson et al. (1989) did not mention it in their
review of ciliates from marine sands. Feeds on flagellates (e.g., Euglena, Chilomonas paramecium,
Trachelomonas), amoebae, ciliates (e.g., Blepharisma japonicum, Coleps hirtus, Colpidium colpoda,
Colpoda, Didinium nasutum, Halteria, Lacrymaria olor, Paramecium, Spirostomum ambiguum, Stentor,
Tetrahymena pyriformis, Urocentrum turbo, Vorticella and hypotrichs), and small metazoans, such as
rotifers, planarians and oligochaetes (Visscher 1923, rammelmeyer 1931, gaJewskaJa 1933, hayes 1938,
Dragesco 1962, JanoVy 1963, khleBoVich 1976, seraVin & orloVskaJa 1977, Bick 1972a, Foissner 1980,
tołłoczko 1980, orloVskaJa et al. 1984, own observations). Diatoms, coccal green algae, fungal spores
and bacteria are also consumed (kalmus 1928, DingFelDer 1962, Foissner 1980, gracia & igual 1987b).
When fed on pieces of planarians (Dugesia tigrina), gigantism and monster formation occurred (JanoVy
1963). Generation time about 17 h at an uptake rate of 10–13 Tetrahymena cells/h (khleBoVich 1976);
about 11 h at 20 °C according to PetroVa et al. (1976); one to three divisions within 24 h, depending on
temperature (PoPoff 1908; misidentified as Dileptus gigas). Biomass of 106 specimens: 1876 mg (Dillon
& hoBBs 1973), about 500 mg when an average size of 400 × 50 μm is assumed (Foissner et al. 1995),
170 mg (Foissner 1987a). At an average of 12 mg/l O and 4.7 mg/l BSB in a Spanish river (igual

Dileptus margaritifer is likely a cosmopolitan because it has been recorded from, e.g., Europe (kahl 1931),
Asia (alekPeroV 1982, 1984), North America (cairns 1965), South America (Pinto 1925, Pettigrosso &
cazzaniga 1987), and Africa (Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis 1986, Foissner et al. 1995). No records are
available from the Australis and Antarctica.
Saprobic classification: sláDeček et al. (1981) and Foissner (1988a) classified D. margaritifer as a beta-
to oligosaprobic ciliate with the following valencies: o = 4, b = 6, I = 3, SI = 1.6. wegl (1983): o = 3, b
= 7, I = 4, SI = 1.7. Bick & kunze (1971): o = 2, b = 8, I = 4. moraVcoVá (1977): b = 10, I = 5, SI = 2.5
(apparently incorrectly calculated). mauch et al. (1985): SI = 2.0. FrieDrich (1990): betasaprobic; o–b
= 4, b = 10, b–a = 6, I = 8, SI = 2.1. According to Šrámek-huŠek (1956b, 1958) rare in oligo- and beta-

mesosaprobic waters. The faunistic and ecological data match the index proposed by FrieDrich (1990):
betamesosaprobic; o = 2, b = 5, a = 3, I = 2, SI = 2.1. In stagnant waters also at higher pollution levels and
in the microaerobic sediment. Most frequent in spring.

Taxonomy and typification: Dragesco (1963) recognized that Jones (1951, 1956) and Jones & Beers
(1953) misidentified their populations as Dileptus anser sensu kahl (1931), who also misidentified D.
margaritifer as D. anser (DingFelDer 1962, wirnsBerger et al. 1984). Jones’ specimens differed from D.
margaritifer in the much lower number of macronuclear nodules and the ability to form a mucous thread
attaching to the substrate. Accordingly, Dragesco (1963) established a new species, D. jonesi, for the D.
anser described and illustrated by Jones (1951, 1956) and Jones & Beers (1953).
Although neotypification is highly recommendable, we suggest to wait for a redescription of a North
American population because the original data are too incomplete to be entirely sure about conspecificity
of the German population studied by song & wilBert (1989). Further, neither Dragesco (1966) and
Blatterer (1994) or song & wilBert (1989) described or commented on the mucous thread, the most
specific feature of D. jonesi.
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 450 × 80 μm in vivo. Shape very
narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with distinct tail associated with a mucous thread, proboscis usually
1/3 of body length. About 100 scattered macronuclear nodules and several globular micronuclei. A dorsal
stripe of contractile vacuoles with 2–3 pores each. Two size-types (5 μm and 2–3 μm) of rod-shaped
extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge. On average 31 ciliary rows, several anteriorly differentiated
into a staggered, anteriorly heteromorphic dorsal brush with monokinetidal tails extending anteriorly and
posteriorly. Oral bulge opening about 25 μm across. Preoral kineties oblique, ordinarily spaced, each
composed of 2–3 narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Not mentioned by Jones (1951). Possibly, a pond on the campus of the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA, W79°02’ N35°55’.
Type and voucher material: Deposition of type or voucher material not mentioned in the original or
subsequent papers (Jones 1951, 1956; Jones & Beers 1953; Dragesco 1964; song & wilBert 1989).

North Carolina, USA, where they are probably still deposited.
Etymology: Dragesco (1963) dedicated this species to Dr. Edward Eugene Jones, Jr. of the University of
North Carolina.
Description: Size in vivo fairly similar in all populations investigated: 250–600 μm in North American
specimens (Jones 1956, archBolD & Berger 1984), 350–600 μm in French cells (Dragesco 1963), about
400 μm in Austrian individuals (Blatterer 1994), and 300–500 × 70–90 μm in the German ones (song &
wilBert 1989); very flexible and slightly contractile. Shape very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid, that
is, length:width ratio about 7–12:1 according to the micrographs and drawings available in the literature.
Proboscis one to two thirds of body length, straight or curved dorsally, highly motile; trunk cylindroidal
in vivo, while bluntly fusiform in protargol preparations (Figs 97j, k); posterior end with indistinct to
distinct tail (Figs 97a, b, i–k, 99v, w). Nuclear apparatus in trunk and base of proboscis, absent from tail.
Number of macronuclear nodules similar in North Carolinan, French, Austrian and German populations,
viz., about 70–100 nodules, while 130–390 nodules in starving Canadian specimens; individual nodules
globular to oblong, about 3–4.5 μm across; divide individually (Figs 97f–h); nucleoli small and globular,
one nucleolus in centre of each nodule in Jones’ specimens, while several nucleoli in German cells. About
16 micronuclei scattered between or attached to macronuclear nodules and approximately 1.5 μm across
(Figs 97a–d, j). A stripe of contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of cell, first vacuole in mid-proboscis, two to
three excretory pores per vacuole; no ventral vacuoles (Figs 97a, i, m). Extrusomes studied only in German
population (song & wilBert 1989): rod-shaped forming two size-types (5 μm and 2–3 μm long) attached
to proboscis oral bulge and scattered throughout cytoplasm, impregnate with the protargol method used;
exploded type II extrusomes with typical toxicyst structure (Fig. 97n). Cytoplasm colourless, packed with
food vacuoles and macronuclear nodules; in posterior trunk sometimes a defecation vacuole. Swims by
rotation about main body axis with proboscis held at an acute angle; frequently attaches to substrate by a
mucous thread, which appears to be exuded by the entire body and passed by ciliary action to the posterior
end where it spun into a tether by body rotation (Jones 1951, archBolD & Berger 1984).
Cilia ordinarily spaced, arranged in about 31 (28–34) longitudinal, ordinarily to narrowly spaced rows.
Right side rows shortened only along anterior fifth of oral bulge; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis
with narrowly spaced basal bodies (Fig. 97l). Left side of proboscis with comparatively broad blank stripe
because several ciliary rows end at level of oral bulge opening, except for one to two kineties extending
into proximal third of proboscis (Figs 97k, m). Dorsal brush on dorsal and dorso-lateral region of proboscis,
remarkable because (i) slightly heteromorphic, especially, in anterior portion of rows where monokinetids
are mixed with dikinetids, and (ii) because some rows begin with a monokinetidal tail composed of one to
four basal bodies (Figs 97k, m); possibly more diffuse than shown by song & wilBert (1989).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, about 25 μm across, projects distinctly because
proboscis only half as wide as trunk (Figs 97a, b, i). Pharyngeal basket obconical, internal basket
impregnates more distinctly than external one with the protargol method used. Oral ciliary pattern dileptid,
i.e., left branch of circumoral kinety associated with oblique to strongly oblique, ordinarily spaced, preoral
kineties, each composed of two to three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 97k, l).
Resting cyst: The description by Jones (1951) reads as follows (Fig. 97e): “In the living condition, the
cysts are spheroidal; they have a light tan color which becomes darker as the cyst ages. There are three cyst
membranes, ecto-, meso-, and endocyst; the color is present only in the mesocyst. hayes (1938) found the
diameter of dilepti cysts to be 80 μm. This is a good average, though cysts vary somewhat in over-all size
and shape. Cysts measuring as little as 65 μm have produced normal, viable animals upon excystment”.
Occurrence and ecology: Dileptus jonesi feeds preferably on small ciliates and flagellates, for instance,
316

Halteria, Euglena and Chilomonas (Jones 1951, archBolD & Berger 1984). The cytostome does not open
until the prey reaches it, and then only enough for the prey item to be ingested (Fig. 99w; archBolD &
Berger 1984). Dileptus jonesi is essentially an active, swimming species forming a mucous thread which
allows attachment to the substrate, as definitely stated by Jones (1951, 1956) and confirmed by archBolD
& Berger (1984). During locomotion, the thread may be seen trailing behind and serves as a sea anchor
(Jones 1951).
Dileptus jonesi was probably discovered in a pond of the University campus in North Carolina, USA,
where Jones (1951) taught. Other North American populations come from two small ponds in the centre
of the woodlot north of the Farquharson Biology Building, York University, Downsview, Ontario, Canada
(archBolD & Berger 1984). There are several unsubstantiated records from Europe and China: eutrophic
pond in Bonn, Germany, where it occurred rarely during the winter season (song & wilBert 1989); eu-
to polytrophic lake in Germany during winter and spring (PackroFF & wilBert 1991); Eifel maar lake
in Germany (PackroFF 1992); benthos of the beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic Pram River in Upper Austria
(Blatterer 1994); pond in the surroundings of the town of Qingdao, China (song & chen 1999).
Remarks: As mentioned by previous authors and recognizable in the micrographs (Figs 99u–y), D. jonesi
is very similar to D. margaritifer and D. beersi in body shape, the nuclear and contractile vacuole pattern,
and several morphometrics. The main distinguishing feature is the ability to form a mucous thread which
is, however, a difficult feature possibly not present all the time. Thus, we used the lower number of ciliary
rows (about 31 vs. 45) and macronuclear nodules (≤ 100 vs. ≥ 200) for keying out the species. Possibly,
the higher number of excretory pores per contractile vacuole (2–3 vs. 1) is also a good feature. Dileptus
jonesi is also similar to Apodileptus visscheri and A. edaphicus. However, A. visscheri is smaller (280 µm
vs. 400 µm), and A. edaphicus is more slender (> 12:1 vs. < 10:1) and has a lower number of ciliary rows
(18–23 vs. 28–34).

Improved diagnosis (based on literature and a new population from Venezuela): Size about 670 × 60 μm
in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like with distinct tail, proboscis about 1/3 of body length.
Usually more than 200 scattered macronuclear nodules and several globular micronuclei. A dorsal stripe
of contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each. Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge: type
I very narrowly ovate, 8–10 × 0.6–1.2 μm in size; type II oblong, about 2.5 × 0.4 μm in size. About 48
ciliary rows, up to 8 anteriorly differentiated into a staggered, distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with
monokinetidal tails extending to second third of body. Oral bulge opening about 20 μm across. Preoral
kineties oblique, ordinarily spaced, each usually composed of 3 narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Slightly brackish (3‰) Mullet Pond, Shackleford Island, North Carolina, USA, W76°39’
N34°41’.
Type and voucher material: Jones (1956) made permanent slides when he was at the Duke University
Marine Laboratory, North Carolina, USA but he did not provide any information about their deposition.
Jones’ slides are not mentioned in the catalogue of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., USA
(corliss 1972). Seven voucher slides (inv. nos 2011/323–329) with protargol-impregnated Venezuelan
specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant
specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.

lying immediately anterior to caudal process and emptying toward oral surface of body. Ciliation uniform,
the ciliary rows spiralling slightly, 21 μm apart and bearing cilia 6 μm in length. Spherical resting cysts
formed. Cysts somewhat variable in size, but usually 100–110 μm in diameter and possessing three cyst
membranes. Ectocyst colorless, laminated, sticky and of variable thickness; mesocyst tan to brown in
color, 2.5 μm in thickness and inelastic; endocyst colorless and always 0.5 μm in thickness”. Jones (1956)
also described carefully the extrusomes (Fig. 98f): “Hundreds of trichocysts are set perpendicularly to the
feeding groove and extend along its entire length. Unexploded trichocysts are blade-like structures 10 μm
long and 0.6 μm wide. They not only occur in the feeding groove, but may be seen moving about in the
cytoplasm of the proboscis and body. In stained preparations, protrichocysts have also been identified in
the cytoplasm. The fully exploded trichocyst is 40 μm long and is composed of a shaft 12 μm in length
which terminates in a 28 μm thread”.

length on average, ~ 2:1 flattened; trunk cylindroidal, slightly flattened, inflated in well-fed specimens
(Fig. 99n); posterior end with distinct tail in vivo up to 70 μm long, recognizable even in specimens
inflated by food inclusions (Figs 99a, l–n, p, t, u). Many macronuclear nodules scattered in trunk and base
of proboscis, not in tail; individual nodules highly variable in shape, that is, globular to ellipsoidal, 3–8 ×
2.5–4 μm in size; divide individually (Fig. 99o); nucleoli small and globular. On average 12 micronuclei
scattered between or attached to macronuclear nodules, about 2.5 μm across in protargol preparations
(Figs 99a, l–n, p, q; Table 53). A stripe of contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk and proximal two
thirds of proboscis; no ventral vacuoles, excretory pores not impregnated with the protargol method used
(Figs 99a, f, g). Two types of extrusomes, not impregnating with protargol, attached to right branch of oral
bulge: type I very narrowly ovate, about 8 × 1–1.2 μm in size, frequent also in cytoplasm, where certain
developmental stages sometimes impregnate with protargol; type II oblong, about 2.5 × 0.4 μm in size
(Figs 99a–d, r, s). Cortex flexible, contains about six granule rows between adjacent kineties; granules
colourless but conspicuous in vivo because densely spaced and ~ 1 × 0.5 μm in size (Fig. 99e). Cytoplasm
colourless, hyaline in proboscis and tail at low magnification (×40), opaque and brownish in trunk due to
numerous granules, up to 10 μm-sized lipid droplets, and several food vacuoles; in posterior end of trunk
sometimes a defecation vacuole with crystalline contents. Some specimens with one or two large food
vacuoles containing small rotifers (Figs 99a, n). Swims rather rapidly; a mucous thread or tether was not
observed.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e., with
thick, strongly impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in about 48 narrowly spaced
rows extending meridionally to slightly helically (Table 53). Right side rows shortened only in anterior
proboscis fifth, except for perioral kinety which extends to tip of proboscis with narrowly spaced basal
bodies (Fig. 99h). Left side of proboscis with conspicuous blank stripe because of shortened ciliary rows
left of oral bulge opening (Figs 99i, j). Dorsal brush on dorsal side of proboscis, staggered, distinctly
heterostichad, composed of up to eight rows with loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids associated with
3 μm long, slightly inflated type I bristles; frequently some extra dikinetids anywhere along right brush
margin. First brush row begins in third fourth of proboscis, while last row commences subapically. Each
brush row continues with a monokinetidal tail extending to base of proboscis with 2 μm long, rod-shaped
bristles (Figs 99i–k).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, projects distinctly because proboscis only half as
wide as trunk, about 20 μm across in protargol preparations, roundish both in vivo and in good preparations
(Foissner’s method), while elliptical in specimens prepared with Wilbert’s method, an artefact known
also for D. margaritifer (Figs 99a, b, h; Table 53). Pharyngeal basket obconical, impregnated only in
distal portion (Figs 99h, i). Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and
narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening; right branch curves around anterior end of
proboscis, while left branch ends subapically almost touching the curved right end (Fig. 99h). Preoral
kineties oblique, ordinarily spaced, each composed of two to three narrowly spaced cilia (Fig. 99i).
Occurrence and ecology: Jones (1956) discovered D. beersi in a slightly brackish (3‰) pond on the
western end of Shackleford Island, which is about 3.2 km off the coast of North Carolina (USA) opposite
to the city of Beaufort. Mullet Pond is approximately 90 m in diameter and has a maximum depth of about
1.2 m. The Venezuelan population is from a non-flooded Petri dish culture of soil from a Tachypogon
savannah about 60 km north of Puerto Ayacucho, the capital of Amazonas state. The savannah belongs
to the farm of Señor Pedro cortez and is close to the Orinoco River, but is never flooded because it is
about 20 m above the river level. The very sandy soil is covered with an algal (or cyanobacterial) crust
and contains little organic matter. Dileptus beersi is a rather large species and thus probably not a typical

soil inhabitant. Some of our specimens contained one or two ingested rotifers. This matches observations
from Jones (1956), who, additionally, observed small ciliates (e.g. Halteria), flagellates, green algae, and
zoogleal masses as further food sources. The cytostome opens before the prey reaches it; frequently the
oral bulge opening is wider than the prey item (Fig. 99v; archBolD & Berger 1984). Dileptus beersi is a
bottom-dweller not forming a mucous thread or tether, and hence does not attach itself to a surface or to
an accumulation of debris, as definitely stated by Jones (1956) and archBolD & Berger (1984).
Remarks: The Venezuelan population matches the North American type in the following characteristics:
very narrowly dileptid to rod-like with a distinct tail, proboscis one third to half of body length; contractile
vacuoles in a dorsal stripe; extrusomes very narrowly ovate and of similar length (8 μm and 10 μm); oral
bulge opening roundish. As usual, there are some small differences, most likely caused by cultivation, i.e.,
Jones (1956) investigated specimens from thriving cultures, while we studied material as obtained from
a non-flooded Petri dish culture set up with savannah soil. For instance, Jones’ (1956) specimens were
larger (450–900 × 60–70 μm vs. 340–630 × 30–80 μm) and had more macronuclear nodules (203–479 vs.
127–336). Unfortunately, Jones (1956) did not provide the number of ciliary rows, but mentioned that they
are 21 μm apart (likely, this should read “2.1 μm apart”). Using this value and an average width of 65 μm,
this would result in 97 kineties, a rather unlikely number not surpassed by any other species. Likewise,
Jones (1956) did not mention the type II extrusomes. As these are very small and thus easily overlooked,
we do not rate it as a significant difference. Although conspecificity is very likely, we do not neotypify D.
beersi with the Venezuelan population because this is a different biogeographic region and reliable data
on the number of ciliary rows are lacking from the North American population.
As mentioned by Jones (1956) and shown by our data, D. beersi is very similar to D. margaritifer. They
match, inter alia, in body shape, the nuclear and contractile vacuole pattern, and several morphometric
features. However, both species differ in the shape of the type I extrusomes (very narrowly ovate vs. rod-
shaped), a feature definitely mentioned and figured by Jones (1956; Fig. 98f). Within the multinucleate
dileptids, D. beersi is most similar to Apodileptus visscheri, which differs by the smaller size (280 × 35
μm vs. 670 × 60 μm) and the lower number of the ciliary rows (24 vs. 48). Dileptus jonesi is distinguished
from D. beersi by the shape of the extrusomes (rod-like vs. very narrowly ovate), the lower number of
ciliary rows (28–34 vs. 36–56), and the presence (vs. absence) of a caudal thread.

Diagnosis: Medium- to large-sized Dileptidae with narrow to rod-like body. Many scattered macronuclear
nodules fusing during ontogenesis. Dorsal brush multi-rowed. Right branch of circumoral kinety
accompanied by a perioral kinety, left branch by many slightly to strongly oblique preoral kineties. Oral
bulge opening dileptid, i.e., roundish or elliptical and located ventrally.
Type species (by original designation): Dileptus visscheri Dragesco, 1963.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix apo (derived from) and the generic name Dileptus, referring
to the Dileptus-like general organization. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Fusion of the macronuclear nodules is the ordinary state in dividing binucleate and moniliform
dileptids (e.g., Paradileptus ovalis, Pseudomonilicaryon brachyproboscis, and P. thononense; Vďačný
& Foissner 2009, present study), while in multinucleate species (e.g., Dileptus beersi, D. jonesi, or D.
sphagnicola) the nodules divide individually (hayes 1938, Jones 1951, golińska 1971, present study). Thus,
Apodileptus visscheri, where the individual nodules fuse during cell division, is a conspicuous exception,

justifying separation at genus level. An analogy exists in the hypotrichs, where the Pseudokeronopsinae
are defined by the individually dividing macronuclear nodules (for a review, see Berger 2006).

Taxonomy: We split this species into two subspecies, according to the shape of the extrusomes, which
was found to be constant in two populations each. Further, the dorsal brush is more diffuse in A. visscheri
rhabdoplites than in A. visscheri visscheri. The sole congener, A. edaphicus, obviously belongs to the A.
visscheri complex, but is sufficiently different to be considered as a distinct species.
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 280 × 30 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
dileptid to rod-like with distinct tail, proboscis about 1/3 of body length. About 90 scattered macronuclear
nodules and several globular micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each. Two
types of extrusomes attached to proboscis’ oral bulge: type I oblong or very narrowly ovate, 4–6 × 0.5–
0.8 μm in size; type II oblong, 1.5–2.5 × 0.3 μm in size. On average 22 ciliary rows, 5–7 anteriorly
differentiated into a diffuse or staggered and distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with monokinetidal tails
extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening about 15 μm across. On average 40 oblique to slightly
oblique, ordinarily spaced preoral kineties, each usually composed of 3 narrowly to ordinarily spaced
cilia.
Etymology: Not given in the original description. Dragesco (1963) dedicated this species to J. Paul
Visscher (John Hopkins University, USA), acknowledging his studies on Dileptus.

Diagnosis: Extrusomes narrowly ovate. Dorsal brush staggered and distinctly heterostichad.
Type locality: Dragesco (1963) discovered Dileptus visscheri in a pond from the surroundings of the town
of Thonon, France, E6°28’ N46°22’. The neotype is from a shallow meadow puddle in the Donnersberg
Park near the centre of the town of Salzburg, Austria, E13°02’ N47°47’. According to Article 76.3 of the
ICZN (1999), the place of origin of the neotype becomes the type locality of the nominal species-group
taxon, despite any previously published statement of the type locality.
Neotypification, type and voucher material: We fix the Salzburg population as a neotype. Neotypification
is needed because (i) no type material is available from Dragesco’s (1963) specimens, (ii) the identity
is endangered by several similar species, (iii) the neotype is from the same biogeographic region and

a similar habitat, and (iv) the protargol preparations are of sufficient quality. Eight neotype (Salzburg
population; inv. nos 2011/218–225) and eight voucher (Mueller boden population; inv. nos 2011/210–217)
slides with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Description: The Austrian data (neotype Salzburg and voucher Mueller boden population) are based on
cultivated specimens. Size usually about 280 × 30 μm in vivo, as calculated from some in vivo measurements
and the morphometric data, assuming 15% preparation shrinkage (Table 54). French cells 180–320 μm
(Dragesco 1963), Polish specimens 200–350 µm (kink 1973), Salzburg individuals 210–310 × 30–40
μm, and specimens from Mueller boden 200–430 × 20–35 μm; very flexible but not contractile (Table 54).
Shape in vivo narrowly dileptid to rod-like, Salzburg specimens usually fusiform in protargol preparations,

conditions and/or the life cycle, as there were rather many exconjugants in this population. The dorsal brush consists
of several staggered rows with ordinarily to loosely spaced dikinetids associated with an about 1–2 μm long, inflated
anterior bristle and an approximately 0.3–0.7 µm long conical or oblong posterior stump. All brush rows continue
with a tail extending to the base of the proboscis with 0.5 µm long monokinetidal bristles. Arrow marks an anterior

length:width ratio near 10:1 both in French (according to the figure in Dragesco 1963) and Mueller boden
specimens, while 7:1 in Salzburg population. Proboscis one third to one half of body length in French
specimens (Dragesco 1963) and slightly less than one third in Austrian cells, flattened, highly motile and
flexible; trunk oblong, unflattened; posterior end with distinct tail preserved also in prepared cells (Figs
100b, e, n–s; 101p–v, 102a–c, r). Nuclear apparatus in trunk, rarely extending into proximal portion of
proboscis, absent from tail. Number and shape of macronuclear nodules fairly similar in all populations
investigated: about 40–90 nodules in French specimens (Dragesco 1963, 1966a), approximately 60 nodules
in Polish cells (kink 1973), 70–100 nodules in Salzburg specimens, and 70–140 in Mueller boden cells;
individual nodules usually globular to broadly ellipsoidal, rarely ellipsoidal, 3–10 × 3–5 μm in size; fuse
in mid-dividers to a globular mass (Fig. 100t), becoming rod-shaped before and during cell fission (Fig.
100h), post-dividers show a three-dimensional macronuclear reticulum (Fig. 101c); usually one, rarely
two small nucleoli in centre or periphery of each nodule. On average 8 micronuclei scattered between or
attached to macronuclear nodules, about 0.5–1 μm across in French specimens, while 2–2.5 μm in Austrian
cells (Figs 100a, b, e, n–s, 101p–v, 105i; Table 54). A stripe of contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of body,
8–12 vacuoles in Polish cells, first vacuole slightly anterior to level of oral bulge opening; no ventral
vacuoles; invariably a single intrakinetal excretory pore per vacuole (Figs 100b, e, n, 101d, 102g, i, j, m).
Two types of extrusomes, not impregnating with protargol, attached to broader right branch of oral bulge
(Figs 100c, d, g, n, 101g, 105k, l): type I very narrowly ovate, about 6 × 0.5–0.8 μm in size; type II oblong
with rounded ends, 1.5–2.5 × 0.3 μm in size; developing cytoplasmic extrusomes sometimes impregnating
with protargol, narrowly ovate to oblong or fusiform and 4 μm long. Cortex flexible, slightly furrowed by
ciliary rows, about 1 µm thick and distinctly separated from cytoplasm, between each two kineties about
six rows of oblong granules (~ 0.2 × 0.7 µm) possibly contained in interkinetal ridges distinct in SEM
micrographs (Figs 100f, i, 102t). Silverline pattern composed of polygonal meshes about 0.5 μm in size
(Foissner 1979). Cytoplasm colourless in Austrian cells, while French specimens greenish due to algal
food; hyaline in proboscis and tail, opaque in trunk due to food vacuoles and numerous lipid droplets up
to 10 μm across; in posterior end of trunk sometimes a defecation vacuole. Swims rather rapidly.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e., with
thick, deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of 22 longitudinal,
ordinarily spaced rows (Figs 100n, 102a–c; Table 54). Right side rows gradually shortened in anterior
fifth of proboscis; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with ordinarily to narrowly spaced basal
bodies (Figs 100j, n, 101d, 102a, m). Left side of proboscis with conspicuous blank stripe because some
ciliary rows end at level of oral bulge opening (Figs 100k, 101a, b, 102b, d, n). Dorsal brush on dorsal and
dorsolateral side of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; composed of five to seven rows; first
brush row begins usually in second third of proboscis, while last row commences subapically; all rows
continue with a monokinetidal tail extending to base of proboscis (Figs 100l, m, 101a, b, d–f; Table 54).
Mueller boden specimens frequently with brush malformations, such as rows broken into short straight or
oblique pieces (Figs 102g, h), posteriorly shortened rows (Figs 102j, 105h), or a ciliary row right of brush
row 1 anteriorly composed of rod-shaped bristles (Figs 102h, j). Type I, II, and VI brush bristles: type I
anterior bristle 3–4 μm long in vivo (1.7–2 μm in SEM preparations), posterior bristle conical, about 1.5
μm long in vivo (0.7 μm in SEM; Figs 102e, f); type II anterior bristle 1–2 μm long in SEM, posterior one
conical, 0.3–0.7 μm (Figs 102l, q); type VI bristles 1 μm long in SEM (Fig. 102q).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, roundish both in vivo and in preparations, about
15 μm across in vivo, projects distinctly because proboscis only half as wide as trunk (Figs 100b, e, g,
k, 102d, k, o, p; Table 54). Internal and external oral basket obconical and distinct both in vivo and in
protargol preparations; slightly bulbous in Mueller boden specimens. Broader right branch of oral bulge

dotted by extrusome tips in SEM micrographs (Fig. 102s). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily
spaced dikinetids, except for narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening (Figs 100j, k,
101a). On average 40 oblique to strongly oblique, ordinarily spaced preoral kineties, each composed of
two to four, usually three narrowly to ordinarily spaced cilia; almost in parallel to circumoral kinety and
composed of comparatively widely spaced basal bodies in some cells possibly regenerating the proboscis
(Figs 100k, 101a, 102i, k, 105j).
Resting cyst (Polish population): Studied by kink (1973) in vivo and in TEM (for original wording, see
general part). Her observations match very well our data from A. visscheri rhabdoplites (see below).
Notes on ex-conjugants: Many exconjugants were found in the preparations from the Mueller boden
population. They are easily distinguished from vegetative cells by the much smaller size (120 × 54 μm vs.
272 × 24 μm), the stouter body (4.7:1 vs. 11.4:1), the shorter proboscis (~ 50 μm vs. 75 μm long), and the
broadly rounded or acute body end (vs. distinct tail). Further, the number of dorsal brush dikinetids and
preoral kineties is much lower (cp. Fig. 101h with Figs 101a, b, d–f). In contrast, the number of macronuclear
nodules (98 vs. 100) and micronuclei (9 vs. 10) is quite similar. Thus, exconjugant reorganization is
associated mainly with intense proboscis and body growth as well as tail formation (Figs 101h–o).
Occurrence and ecology: Apodileptus visscheri was discovered by Dragesco (1963) in a pond from the
surroundings of the town of Thonon, France, where it fed on algae and bacteria. The neotype population
is from a shallow meadow puddle near the so-called Henkerhaus in the Donnersberg Park (a municipal
park near Salzburg city centre). The second Austrian population was found in a floodplain forest in the
surroundings of Vienna, viz., in soil from the Mueller boden (see Foissner et al. 2005 for detailed site
description; designated as Dileptus n. sp. 2). Further, A. visscheri was recorded in the pond of Sadyba
in Warsaw, Poland (kink 1973); in the Dniester River in Ukraine (koValchuk & koValchuk 1992); in
Benin, Africa (Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis 1986); and in the litter and upper soil layer enriched with
minerals (pH 6.4) from a vegetable field irrigated with hard ground water about 40 km north of Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia (Foissner et al. 2008b). Apodileptus visscheri grows well in semi-pure Petri dish cultures
with Paramecium or small scuticociliates as a prey.
Remarks: Our observations match the rather incomplete original data (Dragesco 1963): body length
200–430 μm versus 180–320 μm; body shape narrowly dileptid to rod-like with distinct tail, proboscis
about one third of body length; about 70–140 macronuclear nodules and 8 micronuclei versus 40–90
nodules and 8 micronuclei; and a dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles. As usual, there are some small
differences, for instance, the diameter of the micronuclei (2–2.5 μm vs. 0.5–1 μm across) and the prey
(ciliates vs. algae). Unfortunately, the original description of D. visscheri lacks data about the extrusomes
and the number of ciliary rows. Thus, without neotypification it hardly can be separated from D. jonesi
and D. beersi. The former has rod-shaped extrusomes and more ciliary rows (31 vs. 22), while the latter is
much larger (670 × 60 μm vs. 280 × 30 μm) and has twice the number of ciliary rows (~ 48 vs. 22).
As concerns the two Austrian populations, all important features match, except for body length and width,
resulting in considerably different length:width ratios, viz., 11.4:1 vs. 6.9:1 (Figs 100o–s, 101p–v; Table
54). Possibly, this difference is caused by the culture conditions and/or the life cycle, that is, there were
rather many exconjugants in the protargol slides from the Mueller boden; possibly this is also responsible
for the many malformations found in the dorsal brush (Figs 102g, h).

(preliminary identification; 18S rRNA gene sequence)
Nomenclature: Vďačný et al. (2011b) preliminary identified this taxon as “Dileptus cf. jonesi” but

definitely stated that it differs from D. jonesi by the inability to form a mucous attachment thread. Our
detailed morphological investigations of protargol-impregnated specimens showed that it belongs to
the genus Apodileptus due to the fusion of the macronucleur nodules during binary fission (Fig. 103q).
Further, it is similar to A. visscheri visscheri except for some details (see “Description” below). According
to Article 49 of the ICZN (1999), the name “jonesi” cannot be used as an available name for that taxon.
We do not denote “Dileptus cf. jonesi” sensu Vďačný et al. (2011b) with a new replacement name but
establish a new subspecies, Apodileptus visscheri rhabdoplites, because a holotype is fixed here (Article
72.3 of the ICZN 1999).
Diagnosis: Extrusomes oblong. Dorsal brush staggered and usually diffuse.
Type locality: Ephemeral pond in the Austrian Central Alps, Grossglockner-Hochalpenstrasse, surroundings
of the Hochtor, E12°48’ N47°6’.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/226) and a series of four paratype slides (inv. nos
2011/227–230) with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of
the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip.
Gene sequence: The 18S rRNA gene sequence of type population has been deposited in GenBank
(HM581678). The sequence is 1640 nucleotides long and has a GC content of 42.3%. It is a consensus
sequence based on 19 clones.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek nouns rhabdos (rod) and hoplites (soldier ~ extrusome), referring to
the rod-shaped extrusomes.
Description: This subspecies is highly similar to A. visscheri visscheri, except for the characteristics
mentioned in the diagnosis. Thus, we provide micrographs, showing the general body organization (Figs

and a roughly granular internal layer composed of
macronuclear nodules and bright inclusions 2–3 µm
across.

Apodileptus edaphicus nov. sp. (Figs 104a–p, 105a–g; Table 55)
Diagnosis: Size about 470 × 30 μm in vivo. Rod-shaped with distinct tail, proboscis about 1/3 of body
length. Many scattered macronuclear nodules and several globular micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of
contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each. Two size-types (6 μm and 2 μm) of rod-shaped extrusomes attached
to proboscis oral bulge. On average 20 ciliary rows; dorsal brush diffuse, staggered, all rows with a
monokinetidal bristle tail extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening elliptical, about 22 × 11 μm
in size. On average 55 oblique, widely spaced preoral kineties, each usually composed of 3 ordinarily
spaced cilia.
Type locality: Soil from southern Florida, USA, W81° N26°.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/202) and seven paratype slides (inv. nos 2011/203–209)
with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Derived from the Greek substantive edaphon (soil organisms) because well adapted to the
soil environment by the very slender, highly flexible body.
Description: Size 350–600 × 25–35 μm in vivo, usually about 470 × 30 μm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming 15% preparation shrinkage; flexible but not
contractile (Table 55). Shape rod-like, length:width ratio rather variable (12.4–23.8:1), on average near
17.4:1 in prepared cells. Proboscis slightly less than one third of body length on average, usually curved
dorsally; trunk oblong, unflattened; posterior end with distinct tail in vivo sometimes becoming indistinct
or acute in protargol preparations (Figs 104b, d, i–o, 105a, b; Table 55). Nuclear apparatus in trunk and
base of proboscis, absent from tail region. On average 174 macronuclear nodules; individual nodules
globular to narrowly ellipsoidal, about 4 × 3 μm in size on average; usually a small nucleolus in centre of
each nodule. On average 13 micronuclei scattered between or attached to macronuclear nodules, 2–2.5 μm
across in protargol preparations (Figs 104i–o, 105a–c; Table 55). A narrow stripe of contractile vacuoles
in dorsal side of trunk and proximal half of proboscis, no ventral vacuoles; usually a single (rarely two)
intrakinetal excretory pore per vacuole (Figs 104b, d, h, 105d). Two size-types (6 μm and 2 μm long) of
rod-shaped extrusomes attached to broader right branch of oral bulge and scattered throughout cytoplasm,
where certain developmental stages (oblong or fusiform and 4–5.5 μm long) sometimes impregnate with
protargol (Figs 104a, c, o, 105e, f). Cortex flexible, contains about five granule rows between adjacent
kineties (Fig. 104e). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in proboscis and tail, opaque in trunk due to numerous
lipid droplets 1–10 μm across. Glides and wriggles like a worm.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids; arranged
in an average of 20 longitudinal, narrowly to ordinarily spaced rows (Table 55). Right side rows shortened
only along anterior fifth of oral bulge; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with ordinarily spaced
basal bodies (Figs 104g, p). Left side of proboscis with a blank stripe because some ciliary rows end left
of oral bulge opening (Figs 104f, o). Dorsal brush a long, narrow field on dorsal and dorsolateral region
of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; diffuse, very likely composed of four rows. First row
begins in second third of proboscis, while last row commences subapically. All brush rows continue with
a monokinetidal tail extending to base of proboscis with rod-shaped type VI bristles (Figs 104f, h, o, p,
105d).

Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, broadly elliptical to elliptical both in vivo and in

without specific features (Figs 104d, f, g, p). Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly to ordinarily spaced
dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening; right branch curves
around anterior end of proboscis, while left branch ends subapically almost touching the curved right
end. On average 55 oblique, widely spaced preoral kineties, each composed of two to four, usually three
ordinarily spaced cilia (Figs 104f, o; Table 55).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, that is, in a sample collected by Miss Gerlinde
Fischer along a “Pine Trail” in southern Florida (USA). The sample, in which the species was rather rare,
was a mixture of conifer needles, mosses, lichens, and soil crumbles.
Remarks: Unfortunately, the preparations did not contain dividers making the generic affiliation uncertain.
However, several post-dividers were found. They show a short macronuclear strand, very likely originating
from a fused macronuclear mass, indicating that the nodules did not divide individually (Fig. 105g).
Among the large multinucleate dileptids, A. edaphicus is most similar to A. visscheri, Dileptus jonesi, and
D. margaritifer (Table 55). Apodileptus visscheri is smaller (~ 280 µm vs. ~ 470 µm), stouter (up to 11:1

vs. 17:1), and has fewer macronuclear nodules (on average ≤ 100 vs. 174). Dileptus jonesi has a much
stouter body (8:1 vs. 17:1) and a higher number of ciliary rows (28–34 vs. 18–23). Dileptus margaritifer
has much more ciliary rows (40–50 vs. 18–23).

2008 Monilicaryon Jankowski, 1967 – lynn, Ciliated protozoa: 371 (list of genera)
Improved diagnosis: Medium- to large-sized Dileptidae with narrow to rod-like body. Macronucleus
moniliform. Dorsal brush a single row interrupted by excretory pores. Right branch of circumoral kinety
accompanied by a perioral kinety; left branch associated with a perioral-like kinety formed by the linearly
arranged preoral kineties. Oral bulge opening dileptid, i.e., roundish and located ventrally.
Type species (by original designation): Amphileptus monilatus stokes, 1886.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Latin noun monile (necklace) and the
Greek noun karyon (nucleus), referring to the moniliform macronucleus. Neuter gender.
Remarks: Jankowski (1967) established Monilicaryon as a monotypic subgenus of Dileptus, using the
moniliform macronucleus as sole character. Thirty years later, Foissner (1997a) raised Monilicaryon to
genus rank due to two specialities of the ciliary pattern: (i) the preoral kineties are so strongly oblique
that a single, perioral-like kinety is formed left of the oral bulge and (ii) the dorsal brush is a single row
interrupted by excretory pores. All other dileptids have at least two brush rows and many short, oblique
preoral kineties. We suppose that the perioral-like kinety of Monilicaryon evolved by a linear arrangement
of many short preoral kineties. A similar pattern has been found in the binucleate genus Microdileptus,
where the preoral kineties are so strongly oblique that almost a single, perioral-like kinety is formed.

japonicum)
Nomenclature and taxonomy: Foissner (1997a) neotypified Monilicaryon monilatum because (i) no type
material is available from stokes’ (1886) specimens, (ii) the neotype is from a similar habitat, and (iii) the
protargol preparations are of sufficient quality. We add the danger of misidentifications (see below).
Monilicaryon monilatum was originally described as Amphileptus monilatus by stokes (1886). Ten years
later, schewiakoFF (1896) synonymized it with Amphileptus anser (now Pseudomonilicaryon anser).
However, this was not accepted by conn (1905) and kahl (1931), who combined stokes’ species with
Dileptus. Unfortunately, kahl (1931) misidentified a Hamburg population of Pseudomonilicaryon kahli
as Dileptus monilatus, causing a mixed description. This was recognized by Šrámek-huŠek (1957), who
established a new species for kahl’s population: D. kahli (now Pseudomonilicaryon kahli). In 1967,
Jankowski erected the new subgenus, Monilicaryon, for stokes’ species. Finally, based on a careful
reinvestigation, Foissner (1997a) raised Monilicaryon to genus level (see genus discussion above). More
detailed morphometric characterization recommended.
Monilicaryon monilatum is easily identified by its large size (about 600 μm), the very short proboscis, the
moniliform macronucleus, and the dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles. Within the large dileptids with
moniliform macronucleus, M. monilatum most resembles Pseudomonilicaryon kahli, which has, however,
a longer proboscis (1/3–1/2 vs. 1/5–1/4 of body length), far fewer ciliary rows (22–27 vs. 40–60), and a
different oral ciliary pattern (many preoral kineties vs. a perioral-like kinety left of oral bulge).
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 600 × 60 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
dileptid to rod-like with short tail or gradually narrowed posterior end, proboscis usually 1/5 to 1/4 of body
length. Macronucleus moniliform, usually composed of about 22 ellipsoidal nodules; several globular
micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each. Two types of extrusomes attached
to proboscis oral bulge: type I very narrowly ovate and 6–9 μm long; type II oblong and 2–3 μm long. On
average 50 ciliary rows, of which usually one is differentiated into a staggered dorsal brush. Oral bulge
opening about 16 μm across.

Type locality: stokes (1886) did not specify a type locality, referring to North American stagnant
freshwaters with Ceratophyllum and Utricularia. The neotype is from mud of the Amper River, near town
of Fürstenfeldbruck, Bavaria, Germany, E11°15’ N48°10’. According to Article 76.3 of the ICZN (1999),
the place of origin of the neotype becomes the type locality of the nominal species-group taxon, despite
any previously published statement of the type locality.
Type material: No type material is available from stokes’ specimens. Foissner (1997a) deposited four
neotype slides (inv. nos 1998/73–76) with protargol-impregnated German specimens in the Biology Centre
of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective monilatus (moniliform) obviously
refers to the macronucleus.
Description: All known data are put together because the morphological conspecificity is beyond
reasonable doubt for most populations mentioned in the list of synonyms. This review emphasizes the
authoritative redescription of Foissner (1997a), who studied both live and impregnated cells and provided
neotype slides.
Size highly variable but similar in most populations, usually 400–700 × 50–80 μm in vivo: North American
specimens about 700 μm long on average (stokes 1886, 1888), Connecticut exemplar 300 μm (conn
1905), German cells 500–900 μm (kahl 1931, 1943; Buck 1961), Cameroon exemplar 650 μm (Dragesco
1963), Ugandan specimen 1300 μm (Dragesco 1972a), and German neotype specimens 300–1000 × 50–
80 μm in size with smallest individuals possibly injured (Foissner 1997a).
Body very flexible and slightly contractile, often helically twisted along main axis and/or curved loop-like
(Fig. 106w). Shape narrowly dileptid to rod-like, that is, length:width ratio on average 8.6:1 (3.9–17.6:1),
according to the figures available in the literature and our data based on protargol preparations (Table 56).

Figs 106q–s: Monilicaryon monilatum after protargol impregnation (from Foissner 1997a). q – ventral view of oral
infraciliature. The right branch of the circumoral kinety is accompanied by an ordinary perioral kinety, while the left
branch bears a perioral-like kinety (PE*), which is very likely formed by the linearly arranged preoral kineties typical
for dileptids. Asterisks mark the broad blank stripe right and left of the oral bulge; r, s – dorsal views of proboscis,
showing the dorsal brush composed of a single row of dikinetids interrupted by pores of contractile vacuoles. Dotted

Proboscis conspicuously short, i.e., occupies one fourth to one sixth, rarely up to one third of body length,
slightly flattened laterally and curved dorsally, very fragile and thus mutilated and regenerating specimens
frequent. Trunk massive, cylindroidal to bluntly fusiform and not flattened, posterior region gradually
narrowed to an acute end or tail-like set off from trunk (Figs 106a, b, i, k–p, t, u).
Nuclear strand extends between oral bulge opening and base of tail. Macronucleus a moniliform, basically
straight strand surrounded by a slightly argyrophilic capsule (Figs 106a, b, i, l–p, u, x). Individual nodules
globular to ellipsoidal, occasionally dumbbell-shaped. Number of nodules of usual variability within and
between populations: 31 on average in North American specimens (stokes 1886), 16 in German specimen
(Buck 1961), 24 in Cameroon exemplar (Dragesco 1963), 16–22 in Ugandan cells (Dragesco 1972a),
and 14–30 in German neotype specimens (Foissner 1997a). Size of nodules: 10–15 μm in vivo (Dragesco
1972a), 9–18 × 6–10 μm after protargol impregnation (Table 56). Nucleoli small, roundish and evenly
distributed. Several (11–26 according to Foissner 1997a) micronuclei about 2.5 μm across attached to
macronuclear strand but outside of capsule (Table 56).
Contractile vacuoles similar in all populations mentioned in the synonymy list, that is, arranged in a dorsal
stripe beginning near tip of proboscis; no ventral vacuoles (Figs 106a, g, i, k–p, t). Number of vacuoles:
11 on average in North American specimens (stokes 1886), 16 in a German specimen (Buck 1961), 19 in
a Cameroon exemplar (Dragesco 1963), and 20–40 in German neotype cells (Foissner 1997a). Number of
excretory pores studied only in neotype specimens, viz., invariably a single, intrakinetal pore per vacuole
(Figs 106g, r, s).

Extrusomes studied only by Foissner (1997a). Two shape and size types attached to proboscis oral bulge
and scattered throughout cytoplasm: type I very narrowly ovate, attached with narrower end, 6–9 × 1 μm
in size; type II oblong and 2–3 × 0.5 μm in size (Figs 106c, d, g, v). Cortex gelatinous and conspicuously
thick, i.e., about 2 μm; between each two kineties about three rows of bright, 1.5–2 × 1 μm-sized cortical
granules, very likely mucocysts (Figs 106e, g). Cytoplasm colourless, at low magnification (< ×100)
brownish due to cytoplasmic inclusions and dense granulation; usually with several large food vacuoles
containing ciliates, rotifers, and diatoms possibly from ingested ciliates (Figs 106a, t). Movement slow
and serpentine in organic mud.
Cilia 8–10 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; arranged in about 50 longitudinal, narrowly to ordinarily
spaced rows gradually shortened anteriorly, leaving a rather wide, blank stripe left and right of proboscis
oral bulge (Figs 106b, q; Table 56). First kinety right and left of oral bulge extends with narrowly spaced
basal bodies to tip of proboscis as perioral and perioral-like kinety, respectively (Figs 106b, h, q).
Anterior end of ventral ciliary rows more densely ciliated and slightly curved rightwards when abutting
on circumoral kinety (Fig. 106q). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis; usually composed of
an ordinary or staggered row of narrowly to ordinarily spaced dikinetids associated with type IV bristles,
rarely up to four brush kineties; interrupted by pores of contractile vacuoles (Figs 106f, r, s).
Oral bulge opening usually in second body fifth, projects indistinctly to ordinarily, roundish both in vivo
and in preparations, where it is about 16 μm across (Figs 106a, b, h–q; Table 56). Pharyngeal basket
obconical, distinct both in vivo and in protargol preparations, consists, as usual, of an internal and external
basket: external basket composed of many about 130 × 2 μm-sized rods impregnated only in distal portion
with the method used; internal basket made of many about 100 μm long fibres, very likely transverse
microtubule ribbons originating from the oral monokinetids surrounding the bulge opening (Figs 106j,
q). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced dikinetids in proboscis, while of narrowly spaced
monokinetids around oral bulge opening. Proboscis dikinetids associated with (i) about 10 μm long cilia

forming a distinct mane (Fig. 106a) and (ii) conspicuous fibres extending to centre of proboscis oral bulge,
forming the central fibre (Fig. 106q).
Occurrence and ecology: Some of the faunistic data on M. monilatum very likely refer to Pseudomonili-
caryon kahli because the determination usually followed kahl (1931), who mixed these species.
Monilicaryon monilatum prefers beta-mesosaprobic, benthic habitats in slowly running and stagnant
waters. Often found in the organic mud and between filamentous algae, rarely in the pelagial. There is a
single unsubstantiated terrestrial record from “macchia” soil in Italy (luzzatti 1938). Buck (1961) found
M. monilatum frequently in slightly to strongly polluted running waters, especially near and in capture
nets of certain trichopteran larvae (Polycentropidae), where it possibly searched for food (amoebas,
ciliates and larvae of copepods). Reliably recorded from Europe, North America and Africa, thus possibly
cosmopolitan. Occurs throughout the year (eurythermic), but with a distinct frequency maximum in
summer (Foissner et al. 1995). Feeds on ciliates, rotifers, and small and large diatoms (Nitzschia palea,
N. sigmoidea, Synedra ulna, Cymbella sp., Rhoicosphenia curvata), in spite of the small (~ 15 μm) oral
bulge opening (Dragesco 1972a, Foissner et al. 1995, Foissner 1997a). Biomass of 106 specimens about
900 mg, when an average size of 600 × 60 μm is assumed (Foissner et al. 1995), while 1933 mg according
to nesterenko & koValchuk (1991).
Records from running waters: numerous, especially under stones in slightly to strongly polluted German
rivers (Buck 1961); in the cooling water system of a conventional, large power plant fed by the beta-
to alpha-mesosaprobic Main River, Germany (Bernerth 1982); rare to numerous in a beta- to alpha-
mesosaprobic part of the Alb River, Germany (mauch 1990); in beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic Austrian
and Bavarian rivers (Foissner & moog 1992; Foissner et al. 1992a, b; Blatterer 1994); in a Spanish
river at BSB 0.7–5.1 mg/l (FernánDez-leBorans et al. 1990); in the water-sediment interface of the
5
polluted Stirone and Mincio rivers, Italy (maDoni & Bassanini 1999, maDoni and Braghiroli 2007); in
the periphyton and seston of the alpha-mesosaprobic Sava River in the former Yugoslavia (Primc 1981,
Primc-haBDiJa et al. 1996); rare in the periphyton of oligosaprobic karst waters in the former Yugoslavia
(Primc-haBDiJa & haBDiJa 1991); in the littoral of the Danube River and in the organic mud of the Gidra
River, Slovakia (tirJakoVá 1992, 2003; matis & tirJakoVá 1995); Danube River (enăceanu & Brezeanu

(hul 1987); in Ukrainian streams and rivers (kraVchenko 1969, koValchuk 1997a); Dniester River in
Ukraine (koValchuk & koValchuk 1992); Volga river basin, Russia (zhukoV et al. 1998); inner lakes of
the Valamo Island, Russia (karPoV et al. 1991); winter fauna of freshwaters in the Yuelushan area, China

benthos of slightly to moderately polluted North American rivers (cairns & yongue 1966, 1973; cairns
& Dickson 1972).
Records from slowly running and stagnant waters: in the benthos and plankton of Latvian and German
oligotrophic lakes (liePa 1984, PackroFF & wilBert 1991); Eifel maar lake in Germany (PackroFF 1992);
in the periphyton and sediment of a clean foothill stream in Germany (PackroFF & zwick 1996); in

Improved diagnosis: Small- to large-sized Dileptidae with narrow to rod-like body. Macronucleus
moniliform. Dorsal brush usually multi-rowed, rarely two-rowed. Right branch of circumoral kinety
accompanied by a perioral kinety, left branch by many slightly to strongly oblique preoral kineties. Oral
bulge opening dileptid, i.e., ovate to narrowly elliptical and located ventrally.
Type species (by original designation): Dileptus gracilis kahl, 1931.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek prefix pseudo (false) and the generic name Monilicaryon. Neuter
gender.
Remarks: The main features of this genus, which comprises thirteen species and six subspecies, is the
moniliform macronucleus and the Dileptus-like ciliary pattern, as diagnosed above. There are three further
genera with a moniliform macronucleus but with different oral ciliary pattern: Monilicaryon has linearly
arranged preoral kineties, forming a left perioral-like kinety, while Paradileptus and Pelagodileptus
possess an additional perioral kinety to the right of the proboscis oral bulge.
With respect to the proboscis’ somatic ciliary pattern, four groups are recognizable, indicating that
Pseudomonilicaryon is polyphyletic (Figs 107, 108). Thus, this feature deserves more detailed description
in future.

2012 Possibly, P. massutii has a further synonym: P. kahli (for details, see that species)
Nomenclature and taxonomy: massutí alzamora (1929) misidentified a Mediterranean population as
Dileptus anser. This was recognized by kahl (1933), who classified it as a new species, Dileptus massutii.
Almost seventy years later, Foissner et al. (2002) rediscovered this species in a saline, semiterrestrial
habitat from Namibia and combined it with Pseudomonilicaryon on the basis of the Dileptus-like oral
ciliary pattern and the moniliform macronucleus. Foissner et al. (2002) proposed the superficially described
Dileptus grandis as a junior synonym because Dragesco (1963) distinguished P. massutii from D. grandis
only by the stouter trunk and the slightly longer proboscis; we agree. Dragesco (1963) provided a figure
(reproduced here as Fig. 109l) and the following description for D. grandis: “Nous avons trouvé, en 1946,
dans l’eau provenant d’un terrain inondé (près la Brague, Alpes-Maritimes), un Dileptus gigantesque
que nous avons longtemps assimilé à D. monilatus. En fait nous sommes bien obligés de la considérer
aujourd’hui comme une espèce distincte, que nous décrivons comme suit : très volumineux (longueur
moyenne 1000 μm sur 80 μm de largeur), D. grandis nage lentement sur le fond des godets, tout en
montrant une tendance à se plisser et à s’enrouler légèrement, autour de son axe (à la manière du D.
gigas). La trompe est assez longue (1/2–1/3 de la longueur du corps) et garnie de puissants trichocystes.
La bouche est très apparente et montre une très puissante armature fibrillaire d’une longueur remarquable.
L’appareil nucléaire est constitué par un macronucleus en chapelet (35 éléments ovalaires) et une trentaine
de micronuclei sphériques. Les vacuoles contractiles sont nombreuses (au moins 20) et sont réparties tout
le long de la région dorsale, pénétrant très en avant dans la trompe (une grande vacuole postérieure est
assez fréquente). Le corps finit en une pointe très tronconique, pourvue de longs trichocystes”.
There are several species which resemble P. massutii, viz., P. angustistoma, P. japonicum, P. kahli, and P.
marinum. The first two species differ by body length (~ 400 μm vs. ~ 800 μm), the shape of the extrusomes
(very narrowly ovate vs. rod-shaped), and the ciliary pattern (right side rows not shortened vs. gradually
shortened along proboscis). Pseudomonilicaryon kahli is distinguished mainly by the freshwater habitat
(for details, see that species). Pseudomonilicaryon marinum differs by the short proboscis (1/5 vs. 1/3 of
body length) and the spine-like tail (vs. acute posterior third).
Foissner et al. (2002) neotypified P. massutii because (i) no type material is available from massutí
alzamora’s (1929) specimens, (ii) the identity is endangered by several similar species (see above), (iii)
the neotype is from a similar habitat, and (iv) the protargol preparations are of sufficient quality.
Improved diagnosis (neotype population): Size about 800 × 65 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid
to rod-like with acute posterior quarter, proboscis about 1/3 of body length. Macronucleus moniliform
and tortuous, composed of an average of 47 ellipsoidal to very narrowly ellipsoidal nodules; several
globular micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles with up to 3 pores each. Two size types
(10 μm and 3 μm) of basically rod-shaped extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge. On average 44
ciliary rows, up to 15 anteriorly differentiated into a staggered, distinctly heterostichad dorsal brush with
monokinetidal tails extending to second third of body. Oral bulge opening about 18 μm across. Preoral
kineties slightly oblique, ordinarily spaced, each usually composed of 4 narrowly spaced cilia. In coastal
waters and semiterrestrial saline inland habitats.
Type locality: massutí alzamora (1929) discovered this species in the Bay of Palma de Mallorca, Island
of Mallorca, Spain, E2°38’ N39°33’. The neotype is from a highly saline semiterrestrial habitat in the
Etosha National Park, Namibia, E16°45’ S18°45’ (Foissner et al. 2002). According to Article 76.3 of the
ICZN (1999), the place of origin of the neotype becomes the type locality of the nominal species-group
taxon, despite any previously published statement of the type locality.
Type material: No type material is available from massutí alzamora’s specimens. Foissner et al. (2002)

Etymology: kahl (1933) dedicated this species to Miguel massutí alzamora.
Description: Size usually about 800 × 65 μm in vivo: Mediterranean specimens 400–1000 μm (massutí
alzamora 1929), Namibian neotype individuals 550–1100 × 50–85 μm (Foissner et al. 2002), French
cells about 1000 μm (Dragesco 1963); very flexible but not contractile. Shape very narrowly dileptid to
rod-like, that is, length:width ratio 6.5–19.3, according to the morphometric data (Table 57) and the figures
from massutí alzamora (1929) and Dragesco (1963). Proboscis one fourth to almost one half of body
length, anterior portion curved dorsally, flattened, rather stout in massutí’s specimens, while slender in
neotype and French cells. Trunk oblong to bluntly fusiform, unflattened; posterior end acute in massutí’s
and neotype specimens, while with an inconspicuous tail in French cells (Figs 109a, g–i, l, o, r). Nuclear
apparatus in anterior five sixth of trunk. Macronucleus moniliform, straight in Mediterranean and French
specimens, while highly tortuous in neotype cells, composed of 39–59 ellipsoidal to very narrowly ellipsoidal
nodules in Namibian specimens, 35 nodules in French ones, and only 11 in the Mediterranean cells, as
estimated from the illustration (Fig. 109g) of massutí alzamora (1929); nucleoli numerous and spherical.

Several minute, globular micronuclei attached to macronuclear strand (Figs 109a, g–i, l, r; Table 57). A
dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles, first vacuole in mid-proboscis in neotype specimens, while subapical
in French cells; no ventral vacuoles; up to three excretory pores per vacuole (Figs 109a, l). Extrusomes
studied only in Namibian neotype specimens, accumulated in proboscis oral bulge, especially in its right
branch, numerous and scattered in cytoplasm, immature extrusomes impregnate with protargol; two shape
and size types attached to bulge of proboscis: type I rod-shaped with rounded ends, slightly asymmetrical,
about 10–12 × 0.7–1 μm in size; type II like type I but only 3–4 × 0.5–0.7 μm; when exploded of typical
toxicyst structure, viz., a refractive granule each at proximal and distal end of tube emerging from the
empty capsule, large type I up to 30 μm long, small type II up to 9 μm (Figs 109d–f, q, t–z). Cortex very
flexible, furrowed by ciliary rows in SEM micrographs, contains approximately seven rows of about 1 ×
0.5 μm-sized granules between each two kineties (Figs 109j, k, s). Cytoplasm colourless, contains many
glossy lipid droplets 1–5 μm across and some food vacuoles with loose contents, for instance, remnants of
Condylostomides etoschensis, which is killed and almost completely dissolved by the extrusomes before
it is engulfed; usually a large defecation vacuole in rear end. Movement without peculiarities.
Cilia in protargol preparations about 7 μm long, narrowly spaced, and with deeply impregnated distal half
(Fig. 109c); arranged in about 44 longitudinal, narrowly spaced rows (Figs 109m, n; Table 57). Right side
ciliary rows gradually shortened along oral bulge; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with narrowly
spaced basal bodies (Fig. 109m). Blank stripe on left side of proboscis rather wide because most left side
ciliary rows end at level of oral bulge opening or slightly above (Figs 109n, p). Dorsal brush conspicuous
because occupying dorsal and half of left side of proboscis; composed of up to 15 staggered, distinctly
heterostichad rows. Brush dikinetids loosely to very loosely spaced, associated with type I bristles both

being 2–3 μm long, followed by type VI tail bristles 1 μm long and inflated in vivo (Figs 109b, n, p).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, projects more distinctly in Namibian and French
cells than in Mediterranean specimens, roundish both in vivo and in preparations, about 18 μm across (Figs
109a, d, g–i, l, s). Pharyngeal basket obconical, distinct both in vivo and after protargol impregnation,
without specific features (Figs 109p, s). Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids in
proboscis and possibly of narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening. Preoral kineties
slightly oblique, ordinarily spaced, each usually composed of four narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 109n, p).
Occurrence and ecology: massutí alzamora (1929) discovered the species in the Bay of Palma de
Mallorca, Island of Mallorca, Spain, but did not specify the habitat. Possibly, it was a brackish coastal
pond because he mentioned several typical limnetic species, such as Litonotus cygnus and Aspidisca
costata. agamalieV (1974) reported it from the Western shores of the Caspian Sea, and grolière & nJiné
(1973) from a bog pond in France (as Dileptus grandis). The neotype population is from highly saline
(15‰) soil and litter collected in the surroundings of the Okerfontein water-hole in the Etosha National
Park, Namibia (Foissner et al. 2002). Further record comes from an inundated area close to the town of
Brague, Alpes-Maritimes, Azure Coast, France (Dragesco 1963) and the western Baltic Sea (telesh et
al. 2008).
Pseudomonilicaryon marinum (kahl, 1933) nov. comb.
1933 Dileptus marinus spec. n. kahl, Tierwelt. N.- und Ostsee 23: 63
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: Jankowski (1967) did not combine Dileptus marinus with one of his
subgenera. Indeed, the generic home of this species remains doubtful because its oral ciliature is not known.
We suggest to combine it with Pseudomonilicaryon because of the moniliform macronucleus. Dileptus
marinus var. minimus described by Jones (1974) is recognized here as a distinct subspecies because it is
distinctly smaller than the nominotypical subspecies (200 µm vs. 450–700 μm). Full redescription of both
subspecies is required because several important data are lacking.
Pseudomonilicaryon marinum occurs in saline habitats, where only three other species have been recorded:
P. massutii, Rimaleptus tirjakovae, and R. lacazei. Pseudomonilicaryon marinum is easily distinguished
from these species by the long, spine-like tail (vs. acute posterior body third), a feature definitely mentioned
and figured by kahl (1933) and later confirmed by Bock (1952a) and Dragesco (1960, 1963). Further,
the two Rimaleptus species have only two macronuclear nodules (vs. a moniliform strand composed of at
least six nodules).
Improved diagnosis (includes two subspecies): Size about 200–700 × 50–55 μm in vivo. Shape
cylindroidally dileptid to rod-like with long tail, proboscis about 1/5–1/3 of body length. Macronucleus
a moniliform strand composed of 6–17 nodules. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles. In marine coastal
waters.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective marinus (marine) obviously refers to
the habitat where the species was discovered.

1963 Dileptus marinus kahl, 1933 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 114 (second taxonomic reviser)
Diagnosis: Length about 450–700 μm in vivo.
Type locality: Sand from the saline bay of the town of Kiel, Germany, E10°08’ N54°19’.
Type material: Not available.
Description: kahl (1933) observed only one specimen, which supposedly lost the tip of the proboscis.
Later, he included the species in his revision (kahl 1935), but with two differences (cp. Fig. 110a with
110b): a higher number of macronuclear nodules (12 vs. 7) and the contractile vacuoles in a spiral line (vs.
dorsal stripe). However, the populations observed by Bock (1952a) and Dragesco (1960, 1963) match
kahl’s (1933) original description. Thus, all data are put together.
Body size 420 μm (kahl 1933), 700 × 50–55 μm (Bock 1952a), and 450–600 μm (Dragesco 1960, 1963);
highly flexible but not contractile. Shape cylindroidally dileptid to rod-like with a length:width ratio of
10–14:1, according to the figures provided. Proboscis occupies one fifth to one fourth of body length, about
100 μm long according to kahl (1933), ordinarily set off from trunk, slightly curved dorsally, hyaline
except for anterior end, where Bock (1952a) observed an accumulation of refractive (dark) granules (Fig.
110c, arrow). Trunk oblong, 200 μm long in kahl’s exemplar, opaque due to many granules in Bock’s
specimens. Tail conspicuous because as long as proboscis or even longer, i.e., occupies about one fourth
of body length, 120 μm long in kahl’s specimen (Figs 110a–d). Macronucleus an almost rod-shaped,
moniliform strand extending from underneath oral bulge opening to third quarter of trunk in type and
Dragesco’s specimens, while in middle quarters of trunk in Bock’s specimens, composed of six to seven
(or 12? see above) globular nodules in German specimens (kahl 1933, Bock 1952a), while of 17 nodules

in French cells, as estimated from Dragesco’s illustration (Fig. 110d). Micronuclei and extrusomes not
known. A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles: seven to ten in kahl’s and Dragesco’s specimens, 17–19
according to Bock (1952a) but only nine are shown; first vacuole at level of oral bulge opening in German
specimens (Figs 110a–c), while in proximal half of proboscis in French cells (Fig. 110d). Cortex with
oblong granules, forming about three rows between each two kineties (kahl 1933). kahl (1933) and
Bock (1952a) figured roughly ten ciliary rows on one side of cell. Creeps between sand grains, probing
with the proboscis (Bock 1952a). Somatic and oral ciliature not known. Oral opening and pharyngeal
basket comparatively small, according to the figures available (Figs 110a–d).
Occurrence and ecology: Pseudomonilicaryon marinum marinum was discovered and re-discovered in
sandy sediments of the Kiel bay, a coastal town in northern Germany (kahl 1933; Bock 1952a, 1952b;
telesh et al. 2008). Dragesco (1960, 1963) found it in the mesopsammon of Roscoff, France. FernánDez-
leBorans & noVillo (1993) recorded it in September from the sublittoral of the Santoña Estuary, Bay of
Biscay, Spain, and agamalieV & alieV (1983) reported it from the Divichinskiy estuary of the Caspian
Sea.
Pseudomonilicaryon marinum minimum nov. ssp. (Fig. 110e)
1974 Dileptus marinus kahl, var. minimus, n. var. Jones, Univ. South Alabama Monogr. 1: 25
Nomenclature and taxonomy: Dileptus marinus var. minimus is infrasubspecific because it was published
after 1960 and Jones (1974) expressly used the term “var.” (Article 45.6.3 of the ICZN 1999). Thus, it is
not available, according to Article 45.5 of the ICZN (1999). However, we recognize Jones’ variety as a
reliable subspecies and fix as a holotype the figure given by Jones (1974), here reproduced as Fig. 110e.
Diagnosis: Length about 200 μm in vivo.
Type locality: Sand from the mouth of the Dog River, Mobile Bay, Alabama, USA, W87°57’ N30°38’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective minimus (small) refers to the small
body size.
Description: Length 197 μm in vivo; shape cylindroidally dileptid with a length:width ratio of 11:1,
according to the figure provided. Proboscis about one third of body length, distinctly flattened, slightly set
off from oblong trunk; tail occupies about one fourth of body length. Macronucleus extends between oral
bulge opening and base of tail, moniliform and composed of six broadly ellipsoidal to ellipsoidal nodules.
One (unlikely in our opinion) globular micronucleus close to mid of macronucleus. A dorsal stripe of
contractile vacuoles. Oral bulge opening roundish, comparatively small; oral basket obconical and short.
Extrusomes and ciliature not known.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality in July 1970.

non Dileptus anser – DuJarDin (1841), Perty (1852), kahl (1931), hayes (1938), VuXanoVici (1959), Dumont
(1961), Dragesco (1963), chorik (1968), golińska (1971, 1978, 1979, 1982–1984, 1986), VinnikoVa (1974a,
b, 1976), Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis (1986), yuDin & usPenskaya (2002), who misidentified Dileptus
margaritifer as Pseudomonilicaryon anser (see synonymy list of D. margaritifer)
Generic affiliation, taxonomy, and nomenclature: We assign D. anser to the genus Pseudomonilicaryon
because it has a Dileptus-like ciliary pattern and a moniliform macronucleus.
Pseudomonilicaryon anser was originally described as Vibrio anser by mueller (1773). Sixty-eight years
later, DuJarDin (1841) assigned mueller ’s species to the genus Dileptus. Unfortunately, he misidentified and
mixed Dileptus margaritifer with D. anser, causing many further misidentifications (see D. margaritifer).
In 1859, claParèDe & lachmann described Amphileptus cygnus (Dileptus cygnus since kahl 1931), a
species with the proboscis occupying one half of body length, and thus highly resembling mueller ’s
D. anser. However, kahl (1931) and Dragesco (1963) overlooked that D. cygnus is a junior synonym
of D. anser and identified D. margaritifer as D. anser and D. anser as D. cygnus. This problem was first
recognized by DingFelDer (1962) and later discussed and adopted by wirnsBerger et al. (1984).
According to schewiakoFF (1896) and kahl (1931), P. anser has two further synonyms, viz., D. gigas
grojecensis wrześniowski, 1870 and Amphileptus longicollis sensu Fromentel (1876); we agree.
wrześniowski (1870) and schewiakoFF (1896) considered Amphileptus gigas (now Monomacrocaryon
gigas) as a synonym of P. anser. We disagree because M. gigas has a cylindroidal macronucleus (vs.
a moniliform strand) and a twisted, up to 1.6 mm long body (vs. not twisted and up to 600 μm long).
schewiakoFF (1896) also synonymized Amphileptus irregularis, A. margaritifer (now Dileptus margaritifer),
A. monilatus (now Monilicaryon monilatum), A. moniliger, and Phragelliorhynchus nasutus with P. anser;
we disagree. Amphileptus moniliger and M. monilatum have a much shorter proboscis (1/5 vs. 1/2 of body
length). Amphileptus irregularis is a junior synonym of D. margaritifer, as first recognized by kahl (1931)
and accepted here. Dileptus margaritifer has a shorter proboscis (1/3 vs. ½ of body length) and at least 150
scattered macronuclear nodules (vs. a moniliform strand composed of 7–25 nodules). Phragelliorhynchus
nasutus is much smaller (200 μm vs. 500 μm), thus conspecificity can be excluded.

Pseudomonilicaryon anser resembles only one other species, viz., P. fraterculum, which differs in the
contractile vacuole pattern (vacuoles scattered in trunk and dorsal side of the proboscis vs. in a dorsal
stripe), the higher number of ciliary rows (70–90 vs. 50–70), and the number of cilia comprising the
preoral kineties (usually 3 vs. invariably 2). To be certain of these and other differences, P. anser should
be reinvestigated in detail, preferably a European or Asian population.
wirnsBerger et al. (1984) neotypified P. anser with an Austrian population without providing any reason.
However, we agree because its identity must be fixed for distinguishing it from the North American P.
fraterculum.
Diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 500 × 60 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly dileptid to
rod-like with distinct tail, proboscis on average 55% of body length. Macronucleus moniliform, composed
of 7–25 globular to oblong nodules; several globular micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles
with 1–3 pores each. Two size types (6 μm and 2 μm) of rod-shaped extrusomes attached to proboscis
oral bulge. About 60 ciliary rows; dorsal brush diffuse, staggered. Oral bulge opening about 20 μm across.
Preoral kineties oblique, ordinarily spaced, each composed of 2 ordinarily spaced cilia.
Type locality: mueller (1773) did not specify the type locality, referring to Danish freshwaters (“in
aquis, ubi Lemna”). The neotype is from an alpine meadow puddle on the Schlossalm in the surroundings
of Bad Hofgastein, Salzburg, Austria, E13°4’ N47°9’ (wirnsBerger et al. 1984). According to Article 76.3
of the ICZN (1999), the place of origin of the neotype becomes the type locality of the nominal species-
group taxon, despite any previously published statement of the type locality.
Type material: wirnsBerger et al. (1984) deposited two neotype slides (inv. nos 1986/14 and 1986/15)
with silver nitrate-impregnated (Chatton-Lwoff method, as modified by corliss) specimens in the Biology
Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles
on the coverslip.

Etymology: Not given in original description. The apposite noun anser means goose.
Description: All known and some new data are put together because the morphological conspecificity is
beyond doubts for most populations mentioned in the list of synonyms. Redescription recommended.
Body length about 220 μm in Berlin specimens (claParèDe & lachmann 1859; possibly a measurement
error), 400–490 μm in French cells (Fromentel 1876), 366–615 μm in Polish individuals (wrześniowski
1870), up to 600 μm in Hamburg cells (kahl 1931), 400–600 μm in Czech specimens (Šrámek-huŠek
1949), 520 μm in a Roumanian exemplar (VuXanoVici 1959), 400–600 μm in African cells (Dragesco
1970, Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis 1986), 250–500 μm in Austrian individuals (wirnsBerger et al.
1984), and 150–300 × 50–80 μm (but 400 μm according to Fig. 112j) in Russian specimens (lokot’ 1987).
Thus, an average in vivo length of about 500 µm can be expected; when the average length:width ratio
(9:1, see next paragraph) is taken into account, the size of a typical P. anser is about 500 × 55 µm.
Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape in vivo narrowly dileptid to rod-like, that is, length:width
ratio on average 9:1 (5–15:1), according to the figures available in the literature and our own data based
on micrographs. Proboscis very conspicuous because usually occupying half or even more of body length,
highly motile and flexible, 2:1 flattened, 8 μm wide at base and 6 μm on tip in Roumanian specimens, 9.7
(7–11) μm wide at base and 3.4 (2–6) μm on tip in prepared Austrian cells; with a tendency to roll up or
twist (Figs 111f, o, 112t), possibly misinterpreted as contractility by several authors (kahl 1931, Šrámek-
huŠek 1949, wirnsBerger et al. 1984); very fragile and thus often lost or broken during preparation
(wirnsBerger et al. 1984). Trunk almost oblong to bluntly fusiform, widest in mid-portion, about 110 ×
50 μm in Austrian specimens, unflattened, with a tendency to fold (Fig. 114f). Posterior end with short or
up to 40 μm long tail preserved also in prepared cells and even in specimens inflated by food inclusions or
flattened by coverslip pressure (Figs 111a–h, k–q, s, t, 112a–j, n, r–v, 114a, b, d–g); acute in Roumanian
specimens, which thus could be a different species (Fig. 111i).
Nuclear apparatus usually extending between oral bulge opening and base of tail. Macronucleus
a moniliform, basically straight strand in most populations (Figs 111e–h, k, l, q, s, 112l, u, v), while
slightly to strongly tortuous in Roumanian (Fig. 111i) and Austrian (Figs 111t, 112r, t, 114a, d) specimens;
difficult to recognize under bright field illumination, and thus not seen by claParèDe & lachmann (1859)
and wrześniowski (1870), as mentioned by kahl (1931). Fromentel (1876) and kent (1881) possibly
misinterpreted food inclusions in ehrenBerg’s specimens as two macronuclear nodules (Figs 112e–g).
Nodules connected with one or several short bridges recognizable in Brachet and Feulgen stains (Fig.
112l). Number of nodules of usual variability within and between populations: 11 in Hamburg specimens
(kahl 1931), up to 14 in Czech individuals (Šrámek-huŠek 1949), 21 in an Italian exemplar (canella
1951), 16 in Roumanian specimens (VuXanoVici 1959), 7–15 in Polish cells (golińska 1965), 9 in a North
American specimen (BoVee 1979), and 12–25 in Austrian cells (Fig. 114a; Table 58). Individual nodules
rather variable in shape and size: globular to narrowly ellipsoidal, 13–27 × 11–13 μm in Polish specimens
(golińska 1965), 5–8 μm long in African cells (Dragesco 1970), and 6–17 × 3–7 μm in Austrian specimens
(wirnsBerger et al. 1984). Nucleoli evenly distributed, few to more than ten per nodule, when small
then more numerous (Fig. 112l). Several globular micronuclei attached to macronuclear strand, about
1.5 μm across in African specimens (Dragesco 1970) and 2 μm in Austrian cells (Table 58). Number of
micronuclei fairly similar in various populations: 7 in Hamburg specimens, 6–13 in Austrian cells (Table
58), and 12 according to the drawings provided by Dragesco (1963) and Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis
(1986). Division and post-divisional reorganization of the macronucleus need 150 minutes (golińska
1965). See explanation of Figs 113a–j for details.
Contractile vacuole pattern identical in all populations investigated, viz., a dorsal stripe of 15–20 organelles
with first vacuole near distal end of proboscis; no ventral vacuoles. Number of vacuoles in proboscis:

about seven in Austrian cells, 10–15 according to Jones & Beers (1953). Number of vacuoles in trunk:
seven in an Italian exemplar (canella 1951) and six to eight in Austrian specimens (wirnsBerger et al.
1984). Number of excretory pores studied only in Austrian specimens (wirnsBerger et al. 1984), viz., two
to three, rarely one intrakinetal pore per vacuole (Figs 111e–l, n–q, s, t, 112n, q, u, 114a). claParèDe &
lachmann (1859) misinterpreted a large food vacuole as a single contractile vacuole (Fig. 111m).
Extrusomes of toxicyst type as shown by TEM studies (grain & golińska 1969). Shape and size in vivo
investigated only in an Austrian population (Figs 111r, 114c): type I rod-like with rounded ends, 4–6 ×
0.8 μm in size; type II oblong, only 2 × 0.5 μm in size, more numerous than type I; figure 114c suggests
the extrusomes to be indistinguishable from those of P. fraterculum. Doroszewski & golińska (1967)
observed one to several toxicyst rows in the proboscis oral bulge, but did not mention whether only in the
broader right bulge branch or in both bulge branches.
Cortex flexible; contains several rows of granules (mucocysts) between two kineties each; conspicuous
in TEM because 1.8 µm long and separated from cytoplasm by a lamina corticalis (grain & golińska
1969). Silverline pattern composed of polygonal meshes about 0.2 μm in size, not yet studied in detail (Fig.
112q). Cytoplasm colourless, while greenish in Austrian specimens due to food vacuoles with green algae
and diatoms; hyaline in proboscis and tail, opaque in trunk (Figs 111t, 114b, d–g). Usually a defecation
vacuole with crystalline contents near base of tail; often misinterpreted as a contractile vacuole (Figs 111i,
k, l, n–q, 112a, c, e–h, j, u, v, 114a, b, g).
holmes (1907), who misidentified it as Dileptus gigas, provided the following description of movement:
“Dileptus gigas commonly adheres to the surface of some solid object and waves its long proboscis-like
anterior extremity or neck about in an anti-clockwise direction. The surface of the body is quite sticky, as
is shown by the fact that it adheres readily to any object brought in contact with it. The slender extremity
in its movement about in a circle executes many twists and curls in more or less irregular ways. These
movements may be very vigorous or they may be very slow, but they scarcely ever entirely cease. The
slender neck is very extensile and may be elongated to three or more times when in a contracted state.
Dileptus often executes short forward and backward movements at tolerably regular intervals. During
its movement forward the body elongates, and while gliding backward it widens, showing the same
correlation of contractility with the direction of the beat of the cilia that occurs in Loxophyllum meleagris.
The backward and forward excursions vary exceedingly in length. Frequently they are exceedingly
short. Even when the organism remains attached in one place the body undergoes more or less regular
elongations and contractions while waving about the anterior extremity. There is a rhythm here much as
in the preceding species occurring quite independently of external stimulation. The posterior third of the
body when severed from the rest still undergoes elongations and contractions, although in a somewhat
lessened degree. In larger pieces the rhythm of movement is more manifest.” These observations basically
match our data from Pseudomonilicaryon fraterculum.
Cilia about 6 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; arranged in about 60 meridional, narrowly to ordinarily
spaced rows (Table 58). grain & golińska (1969) strongly underestimated the number of ciliary rows
(12–20; Figs 112u, v), as evident from one of their micrographs, which shows 13 kineties in the right side
region of the oral bulge opening, suggesting about 52 rows in total. Details of ciliary pattern studied by
grain & golińska (1969), golińska (1971), and wirnsBerger et al. (1984): (i) first row right of circumoral
kinety extends as perioral kinety to tip of proboscis (Figs 112k, o, s, u); (ii) left side rows end at level of
or slightly above oral bulge opening (Figs 112k, p–s, v); (iii) left side of proboscis with comparatively
narrow blank stripe due to the slender proboscis and brush kinetids extending onto left side (Figs 112p, r,
v); (iv) dorsal brush a long field occupying dorsal and most of left side of proboscis, diffuse and staggered
(Figs 112p, r, v); (v) brush dikinetids very loosely spaced, associated with 3 μm long bristles.

Oral bulge opening slightly underneath second body half, roundish both in vivo and in protargol
preparations, about 20 μm across, usually projects distinctly because proboscis less than half as wide as
trunk (Figs 111e, i, j, l–q, s, t, 112a–j, k, o, p, s–v). Pharyngeal basket obconical, almost 20 μm long in
preparations, without specific features (Figs 112k, s; Table 58). Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly
spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening (Figs 112o,
p, u, v). Preoral kinety pattern quite similar in the populations studied by grain & golińska (1969),
golińska (1971), and wirnsBerger et al. (1984): individual kineties ordinarily spaced in proximal half
of proboscis while widely spaced in distal half, oblique, invariably composed of two ordinarily to loosely
spaced cilia (Figs 112k, p, r, s, v).
Occurrence and ecology: “Pseudomonilicaryon anser and P. fraterculum are the kings of beasts among
the ciliated protozoa. They are entirely carnivorous and their appetite is apparently insatiable. The prey is
stung by the well developed extrusomes which dileptids bear upon their long proboscis and if too large to
be swept into the buccal cavity by the cilia is forced in by the writhings of the proboscis (hausman 1917)”.
We agree!
In most studies, P. anser is called Dileptus cygnus because the determination usually followed kahl
(1931). Pseudomonilicaryon anser is a bottom-dweller slowly moving through organic mud, constantly
probing with the proboscis; rarely free-swimming. When disturbed, swims rapidly backwards but soon
settles on microscope slide. Frequently, several specimens gather in masses of organic debris, in empty
cladoceran shells (Fig. 112m; Jones & Beers 1953, Doroszewski 1968, wirnsBerger et al. 1984), or in

the leaf rosettes of Characeae (Fig. 7d ; Fauré-Fremiet 1910). Pseudomonilicaryon anser is a catharobic
ciliate rather common but rarely abundant in stagnant waters and ephemeral habitats, such as rain-water
pools, puddles, and mosses (hausman 1917, kahl 1931, DingFelDer 1962, Dragesco 1963). klekowski
(1981) calculated a wet weight of 2400 mg/106 ind. and an oxygen consumption of 3000 pl O /ind./h at
2
23 °C (see also Fenchel & Finlay 1983); chorik & shuBernetsky (1978) mentioned 2400 pl O /ind./h at
2
23 °C. Pseudomonilicaryon anser grows well in Petri dish cultures with Pringsheim’s solution enriched
with dried egg yolk as a medium and Colpidium colpoda and Tetrahymena pyriformis as a prey (for

2011 Pseudomonilicaryon fraterculum – Vďačný, orsi, BourlanD, shimano, ePstein & Foissner, Eur. J. Protistol.
47: 297 (authors disclaimed the name for nomenclatural purposes according to Article 8.3 of the ICZN 1999;
18S rRNA gene sequence)
Diagnosis: Size about 600 × 70 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with distinct tail,
proboscis on average 55% of body length. Macronucleus moniliform, composed of an average of 26
globular to oblong nodules; several globular micronuclei. Many scattered contractile vacuoles, each with
1–2 pores, in trunk and dorsal side of proboscis. Two size types (10 μm and 2.5 μm) of rod-shaped
extrusomes attached to right branch of oral bulge. On average 80 ciliary rows; dorsal brush multi-rowed,
staggered, with monokinetidal tails extending anteriorly and posteriorly. Oral bulge opening about 30
μm across. Preoral kineties narrowly to ordinarily spaced, slightly oblique, each usually composed of 3
narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Soil from a puddle in front of the Idaho Transportation Department Building, Boise, Idaho,
USA, W116°13’50” N 43°38’10”.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/231) and 17 paratype slides (inv. nos 2007/139-144,
2011/232–248) with silver nitrate-impregnated specimens, and five paratype slides with protargol-
impregnated cells have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz
(LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. (See also introduction to
description.)
Gene sequence: The 18S rRNA gene sequence of type population has been deposited in GenBank
(HM581677). The sequence is 1640 nucleotides long and has a GC content of 42.3%. It is a consensus
sequence based on 19 clones.
Etymology: The Latin noun fraterculum (little brother) refers to the high similarity with the European
Pseudomonilicaryon anser.
Description: Pseudomonilicaryon fraterculum was first noted in a non-flooded Petri dish culture of soil
from the type locality. However, few specimens were contained. Thus, pure cultures were established with
Eau de Volvic and soil eluate containing the natural protist community. Only few of the cultures did well
and provided the material needed for silver and SEM preparations. Likewise, P. fraterculum is difficult to
impregnate with protargol, usually showing only the nuclear apparatus.
Size 470–930 × 50–85 µm in vivo, on average 648 × 71 µm (Table 59); considerably smaller in Chatton-
Lwoff silver nitrate preparations, even if 5% shrinkage is added (563 × 67 µm), indicating the influence
of culture conditions; very flexible but not contractile. Shape very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid,
length:width ratio near 9:1 both in vivo and in preparations. Proboscis very conspicuous because
occupying an average of 55% of body length, highly motile and flexible, 2:1 flattened, rather fragile and
thus sometimes lost when cells are transferred from the culture onto a microscope slide; trunk oblong
to fusiform both in vivo and in preparations, widest in mid-region, unflattened, with a tendency to fold;
posterior end with distinct tail up to 70 μm long in vivo and well recognizable in most prepared specimens
(Figs 115h, j, o–u, 116a–f, o–q, 119a, i; Table 59). Nuclear apparatus extends between oral bulge opening
and base of tail. Macronucleus a moniliform and tortuous strand composed of an average of 26 nodules;
individual nodules rather variable in shape and size, that is, globular to narrowly ellipsoidal, on average 10
× 6 μm in size; several nucleoli, most 2–3 μm across. On average 17 micronuclei attached to macronuclear
strand or to a concavity of the macronuclear nodules, 4 μm across in vivo, while 2.5–3 μm in prepared
specimens (Figs 115h, g, o–u, 116g, s; Table 59). Many scattered contractile vacuoles in trunk and dorsal

rows, while only two subapically, indicating gradual shortening, (ii) first row right of perioral kinety with
comparatively narrowly spaced basal bodies, but never as narrow as in perioral kinety, (iii) a narrow blank
stripe right of oral bulge; and (iv) a special silverline pattern (see below). First row right of circumoral
kinety extends as perioral kinety with narrowly spaced cilia to tip of proboscis. Dorsal brush on dorsal and
dorsolateral region of proboscis; multi-rowed; staggered. Brush dikinetids ordinarily to loosely spaced,
associated with tongue-shaped type IV bristles both being 2.5–3 μm long in vivo, shrunken to about 1.8–2.5
μm in SEM preparations (Figs 115b, n, 117f, k, 119h, k, j, k, m). The ventralmost brush rows commence
with a monokinetidal tail of ordinary cilia, while the more dorsally located rows begin, as usual, with
dikinetidal bristles (Fig. 119h). Posteriorly, all rows continue with a monokinetidal tail of 1–2 μm long
(0.8–1.3 μm in SEM), oblong type VI bristles ending at level of oral bulge opening (Figs 119j–m).
Silverline pattern narrowly and polygonally meshed, meshes 0.5–1 μm in size (Figs 115m, n, 117f, i, k);
distinctly larger (2–2.5 μm) and quadrangular in right proximal half of proboscis, forming a platyophryid
pattern (Foissner 1993) due to median silverlines dividing the meshes in mid (Figs 115k, l, 117g, h, j, l).
Median silverlines gradually split into two to three anastomosing lines, producing the narrowly meshed
pattern typical for the trunk (Fig. 117h).
Oral bulge opening slightly underneath second body half, projects distinctly because base of proboscis
only half as wide as trunk, about 30 μm across both in vivo and in preparations, except for a single SEM
specimen with an ovate bulge opening, possibly an artefact occurring also in other species (Figs 115a, h–j,
117a–e, 119c, d; Table 59). Pharyngeal basket obconical, distinct both in vivo and in preparations, about
50 μm long, without specific features. Oral bulge distinct in SEM micrographs due to the metachronal
ciliary waves and extrusome tips in broader right branch (Figs 119b, d, e). Circumoral kinety composed of
narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids (possibly) around oral bulge
opening (Fig. 115i). Preoral kineties narrowly to ordinarily spaced, slightly oblique; usually composed of
three, rarely four or two narrowly spaced cilia each; separated by distinct ridges in SEM micrographs (Figs
115i, n, 116r, u, 119e, f).
Movement and behaviour: Pseudomonilicaryon fraterculum is a bottom-dwelling, sluggish ciliate usually
sitting in or slowly moving through masses of organic debris and vigorously probing with the proboscis.
One probing cycle takes about four seconds and consists of four actions (Figs 115v–y): a dorsal stroke, a
dorsal return stroke, a ventral stroke, and a ventral return stroke. During the dorsal stroke, the proboscis
is behind the trunk, describing a semicircle when the tip of the proboscis reaches the level of the tail or
a quarter-circle when the proboscis forms a right angle with the trunk. Then, the proboscis undulates,
forming a sinusoid pattern (Fig. 115v). The dorsal return stroke follows the undulation immediately and
the proboscis moves antero-ventrally in an arc-shaped pattern (Fig. 115w). The ventral stroke is performed
in a similar way to the dorsal one but in front of the trunk, i.e., the tip of the proboscis reaches the level
of the tail or the proboscis forms only a right angle with the trunk, and then commences undulation (Fig.
115x). Finally follows the ventral return stroke during which the proboscis moves in an antero-dorsal
direction, forming an arc-shaped pattern (Fig. 115y). During probing, the cell slowly rotates about the
main body axis. When disturbed, P. fraterculum twists but never contracts the proboscis (Figs 115r, s,
116p), swimming rapidly backwards rotating about the main body axis; however, soon slows down and
sits on the slide again. Does not attach to the substrate by a mucous thread or tether.
Resting cyst (Figs 115c, 118a–g; Table 59): Encystment was induced by transferring a dozen specimens
onto a microscope slide with a concave deepening containing centrifuged soil eluate. The preparation was
stored in a moist chamber and checked every 24 h. Only four specimens encysted four days after setting
up the preparation, while the others became very small and died.
One week-old resting cysts 95–110 × 60–80 μm in size, on average 105 × 75 μm; broadly ellipsoidal with

cycle takes about four seconds and consists of four actions: a dorsal stroke, a dorsal return stroke, a ventral stroke,
and a ventral return stroke. v – during the dorsal stroke, the tip of the proboscis is back of the trunk, describing a
quarter-circle. Then the proboscis undulates, forming a sinusoid pattern; w – during the dorsal return stroke, the
proboscis moves antero-ventrally in an arc-shaped pattern; x – the ventral stroke is performed in a similar way as the
dorsal one but in front of the trunk, that is, the proboscis forms a right angle with the trunk and then waves; y – during
the ventral retroaction, the proboscis moves in an antero-dorsal direction, forming an arc-shaped pattern.

size, while type II is oblong and about 2 μm long; s – the nuclear apparatus consists of several globular micronuclei attached
to the moniliform macronuclear strand composed of about 20 nodules; u – in mid-portion of the proboscis, the preoral kineties
are slightly oblique and composed of three to four cilia each. This is an important feature distinguishing P. fraterculum from the
highly similar P. anser, whose preoral kineties are invariably composed of two cilia. EI, II – extrusome types, MA – macronuclear

a length:width ratio of 1.4–1.5:1 (Table 59). Cyst wall structureless, light brown, 2–3 μm thick, increasing
to 3–4 μm in cysts slightly squashed by the coverslip (Figs 118a–d, f). Wall tripartite in empty cysts from
an old culture (Figs 115c arrow, 118e): outer layer colourless, 3–4 μm thick; middle layer light brown, 2–3
μm thick; inner layer membranous and colourless. Escape apparatus as a conspicuous convexity (plug)
in anterior pole area, colourless, compact, and about 20 μm in size, likely produced by middle wall layer
(Figs 115c, 118a–d); lacking in empty cysts, showing that cells left cysts this way (Fig. 118e); cannot be
removed by mechanical pressure, causing breaks in posterior wall area (Fig. 118d arrow). Pharyngeal
basket possibly preserved as an oblong, bright, 30 μm long structure opposed to escape apparatus (Figs
115c, 118d). Cyst contents partitioned into a thin peripheral layer of refractive, about 0.3 μm-sized granules
and a large central area packed with 2–4 μm-sized globules (autophagous vacuoles?) not dissolving in
water when cyst contents is squeezed out (Figs 115c, 118a). Macronuclear nodules fused to an ellipsoidal,
central mass 23–50 × 22–35 μm in size; many small nucleoli (Fig. 118b). Numerous 5 μm long extrusomes
scattered throughout cytoplasm and attached to cell cortex (Figs 118b, g). Cilia maintained, arranged in
meridional rows, start beating when cyst is slightly pressed by the coverslip (Fig. 108g).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, that is, in a mixture of cyanobacterial crusts,
dead grass clippings and the 0–3 cm upper soil layer from a grass lawn in Idaho, USA. During the late
spring and summer months, the lawn is flood-irrigated once every week by a canal system connecting
with the Boise River. The water is absorbed over three to four days. The ephemeral puddles remaining just
prior to complete absorption/evaporation are rich in cyanobacteria which form crusts during the fall and
winter months when the lawn is not irrigated. The sample was collected on July 18, 2007 by Dr. William
BourlanD (Boise State University, Idaho, USA).
Remarks: Within congeners, P. fraterculum resembles only P. anser, in having a highly motile proboscis
occupying half or more of body length. Both species are very similar, inter alia, in body shape and size, the
nuclear apparatus, and several morphometric features. However, P. fraterculum has a different contractile
vacuole pattern (vacuoles scattered in trunk and dorsal side of proboscis vs. only dorsal vacuoles in
proboscis and trunk), a higher number of ciliary rows (70–90 vs. 50–70), and a higher number of basal
bodies comprising the preoral kineties (usually 3 vs. invariably 2). The higher number of macronuclear
nodules (20–34 vs. 12–25) and micronuclei (11–24 vs. 6–13) emphasize the distinctness of the North
American population. Finally, P. fraterculum must be compared with Phragelliorhynchus nasutus, a
poorly described North American organism also having a long proboscis. However, Ph. nasutus is much
smaller (200 μm vs. 600 μm), thus conspecificity can be excluded.

1963 Dileptus dimorphus wang, 1940 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 115 (first taxonomic reviser)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: Jankowski (1967) did not combine Dileptus dimorphus with one
of his subgenera. Indeed, the generic home of this species remains doubtful because its oral ciliature is
not known. We suggest to combine D. dimorphus with Pseudomonilicaryon because of the moniliform
macronucleus. Full redescription is required.
Pseudomonilicaryon dimorphum is similar to only two other species, viz., P. aculeatum and P. edaphoni,
which also have the macronucleus composed of only four serially arranged nodules. However, P. dimorphum
differs from these and all other dileptids, except for Rimaleptus lacazei and Monomacrocaryon tenue, in
being highly contractile (vs. not contractile). This peculiarity was carefully studied and illustrated by wang
384

(1940) and confirmed by Dragesco (1963) in a French population. Rimaleptus lacazei is distinguished
from P. dimorphum by the number of macronuclear nodules (two vs. four) and the habitat (marine vs.
freshwater). Monomacrocaryon tenue differs from Pseudomonilicaryon dimorphum in being much smaller
(60–110 μm vs. 260–390 μm) and having only two dorsal contractile vacuoles (vs. a dorsal row of at least
five vacuoles).
Improved diagnosis: Length about 315 × 50 μm in vivo, contracts slowly to less than 200 µm. Shape
narrowly to very narrowly dileptid with long, spine-like tail, proboscis about 1/3 of body length.
Macronucleus moniliform, composed of 4 oblong nodules; 4 globular micronuclei. A dorsal row of
contractile vacuoles. About 16 ciliary rows.
Type locality: Pond in the Campus of the Bible Institute, Nanyoh, Hunan, Japan, E139°258’ N36°10’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Greek numeral di (two) and the Greek
noun morphe (form, shape), obviously referring to the two shapes (extended and contracted) the species
may assume.
Description: Size in extended Japanese specimens 260–390 × 35–60 µm (wang 1940) and about 300
µm in French individuals (Dragesco 1963); highly flexible and contractile to less than 200 µm; both
contraction and extension occur slowly. Shape of extended specimens narrowly to very narrowly dileptid
with a length:width ratio of about 5.5–7:1, according to the figures provided (Figs 120a, g, h). Proboscis
about one third of body length, 90 µm long according to wang (1940), slender and thus distinctly set off
from broad trunk, usually curved dorsally, in contracted cells shortened to a triangular, massive lip (Figs
120a, b, g–i). Trunk fusiform, widest in mid-portion, more or less flattened, only slightly broadened in
contracted specimens. Tail conspicuous because up to 100 µm long; without cilia in type population, while
ciliated in French specimens; in fully contracted specimens a bi- or rarely trifurcated stump, attaching
cells to water plants (Figs 120a, b, d–i). Nuclear apparatus in middle quarters of trunk. Macronucleus a
moniliform, almost straight strand composed of four nodules; individual nodules about 18 × 11 μm in
size, oblong in dorsal and ventral view, reniform when viewed laterally in Japanese specimens; only 4
μm across and lenticular according to Dragesco (1963), but about 18 × 9 μm when calculated from his
illustrations. Invariably four micronuclei, usually one each in a concavity of macronuclear nodules or in
between two nodules, 4 μm across in Japanese specimens (Figs 120a, b, g–i). A stripe of 7–11 contractile
vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk, first vacuole near level of oral bulge opening (Figs 120a, b, g, h). Shape
and size of extrusomes not known, form two rows in oral bulge of proboscis (wang 1940). Cytoplasm
brownish in Japanese cells, while orange in French specimens, possibly due to algal food; proboscis
and tail hyaline, trunk opaque due to many food vacuoles and lipid droplets; in posterior end of trunk
sometimes a defecation vacuole. About 16 longitudinal ciliary rows (wang 1940) becoming helical in
contracted cells (cp. Fig. 120a with 120b). Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, projects
ordinarily, roundish with broadly fusiform opening (Fig. 120c). Pharyngeal basket obconical, short. Swims
by rotation about main body axis, using the tail as a rudder (wang 1940).
Occurrence and ecology: Pseudomonilicaryon dimorphum was discovered by wang (1940) among
water plants of a small pond in the Campus of the Bible Institute, Nanyoh, Hunan, Japan. Great numbers
occurred during October and November, 1937. Dragesco (1963) found it in July, 1961 in fine sand from
the Excenevex beach, Lake Léman, France. Both populations fed on algae.

1963 Dileptus aculeatus Dragesco, 1960 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 118 (first taxonomic reviser)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: Jankowski (1967) did not assign Dileptus aculeatus to one of his
subgenera. Indeed, the generic home of this species remains doubtful because its oral ciliature is not known.
We suggest to combine D. aculeatus with Pseudomonilicaryon because of the moniliform macronucleus.
Full redescription is required.
There are only two similar species, viz., P. dimorphum and P. edaphoni. The former is highly contractile
(vs. not contractile), the latter lacks a tail (vs. a very prominent tail) and has a different contractile vacuole
pattern (ventral and dorsal vacuoles vs. only dorsal). The main features of P. aculeatum, i.e., the spiny tail
and the curious nuclear apparatus, were checked in many specimens to exclude post-divisional and post-
conjugational processes (Dragesco 1960).
Improved diagnosis: Length about 300 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with
long, spine-like tail, proboscis about 1/3 of body length. Nuclear apparatus composed of 4 oblong nodules
in 2 groups and 4 ellipsoidal micronuclei. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles.
Type locality: Lake Léman, Thonon region, France, E6°21’ N46°21’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: The Latin adjective aculeatus (spiny) refers to the spine-like tail of the species.
Description: Length about 300 μm in vivo; flexible but not contractile. Shape very narrowly to
cylindroidally dileptid, that is, length:width ratio 8–11:1, according to the figures provided. Proboscis
about one third of body length, distinctly set off from oblong trunk; tail conspicuous because spine-like
and occupying one fifth to one fourth of body length (Figs 120j, m). Nuclear apparatus in middle quarters
of trunk or in anterior three quarters of trunk. Macronucleus constantly composed of four oblong nodules,
forming two zigzagging groups. Invariably four ellipsoidal micronuclei attached to macronuclear nodules,
micronuclei surrounded by a distinct membrane in methyl green stains (Figs 120j, k, m). A stripe of five
to six contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk. Cortex with yellow brown granules, forming about three
rows between each two kineties (Fig. 120l). Extrusomes, oral apparatus, and ciliature not described.
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found at type locality, that is, in fine sand from the shore of the Excenevex
beach, Lake Léman, France; in the interstice and pelagial of the Caspian Sea (agamalieV 1969, 1971,
1974; Petran 1977; alekPeroV & alieV 1996) and on its islands (agamalieV 1972); and in the upper 4 cm
of the ground of the west coast of the Caspian Sea (agamalieV 1970).
Pseudomonilicaryon edaphoni (song, 1994) nov. comb. (Figs 120n–s)
1994 Dileptus edaphoni sp. nov. song, Acta zootax. sin. 19: 388
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: We combine Dileptus edaphoni with Pseudomonilicaryon because it
has a Dileptus-like ciliary pattern and a moniliform macronucleus. Pseudomonilicaryon edaphoni belongs
to the small group of dileptids with four macronuclear nodules, but is easily identified by the lack of a
tail and the contractile vacuole pattern (ventral and dorsal vacuoles vs. only dorsal ones). However, a
solid redescription is necessary because details of the extrusomes and dorsal brush are lacking, and most
morphometrics are based on four specimens only.
Diagnosis: Size about 240 × 35 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid with acute posterior third,
proboscis about 1/3 of body length. Macronucleus moniliform, composed of 4–5 globular nodules; 4
globular micronuclei. Extrusomes 5 μm long, curved rods. Usually 3 dorsal and 2 ventral contractile
387

vacuoles with 1 pore each. On average 22 ciliary rows, three anteriorly differentiated into a dorsal brush.
Oral bulge opening ovate. Preoral kineties ordinarily spaced, strongly oblique, each usually composed of
2 narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Soil from the surroundings of the town of Qingdao, China, E120°43’ N36°8’.
Type material: Deposition not mentioned in the original paper (song 1994b) but Prof. W. song usually
deposits type material in the College of Fisheries, Ocean University of Qingdao, China.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek substantive edaphon (soil biota) and the inflectional ending i,
referring to the habitat of the species.
Description: Size 180–300 × 30–40 μm in vivo; very flexible but not contractile. Shape very narrowly
dileptid with a length:width ratio of about 6–7:1, according to the figures. Proboscis one third of body
length, anterior fifth usually curved dorsally; trunk fusiform and unflattened; posterior third acute (Figs
120n, o). Nuclear apparatus in middle quarters of trunk. Macronucleus a moniliform strand composed of
four to five nodules (possibly seven in Fig. 120q); individual nodules 7–11 × 2–3 μm in size after protargol
impregnation; many small, globular nucleoli. Four micronuclei attached to macronuclear strand, 2–3 μm
across in protargol preparations (Figs 120n, o, q). Usually three dorsal and two ventral contractile vacuoles
in trunk, each vacuole with a single excretory pore (Figs 120n, o, s). Extrusomes not studied in vivo, 5
μm long and slightly curved in protargol preparations, attached to oral bulge and scattered throughout
cytoplasm (Figs 120o, p). Cytoplasm colourless, trunk opaque because packed with lipid droplets and
food vacuoles, proboscis and rear body end hyaline; sometimes a subterminal defecation vacuole.
Cilia ordinarily spaced, arranged in 21–23 longitudinal, ordinarily spaced rows. Right side rows shortened
only near anterior end of oral bulge; perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with narrowly spaced basal
bodies (Fig. 120s). Blank stripe on left side of proboscis rather narrow because one or two kineties extend
almost to tip of proboscis (Fig. 120r). Dorsal brush on dorsal side of proboscis, probably three-rowed
(not studied in detail and possibly too much schematized), remarkable because each row begins with a
monokinetidal tail of two to three basal bodies (Fig. 120r).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, ovate, hardly projecting (Figs 120n, r). Pharyngeal
basket obconical, well recognizable in protargol preparations (Figs 120o, r). Oral ciliary pattern dileptid,
i.e., left branch of circumoral kinety associated with many ordinarily spaced, strongly oblique preoral
kineties each composed of one to three, usually two narrowly spaced cilia (Fig. 120r).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, that is, in the 0–2 cm upper soil layer in the
surroundings of the town of Qingdao, China.
Pseudomonilicaryon falciforme (kahl, 1931) nov. comb. (Figs 121a–y, 122a–m; Table 60)

non Dileptus falciformis kahl, 1932 – alekPeroV, 2005, Atlas svobodnoživuŝih infuzorij: 70 (misidentification, see
insufficiently described dileptids)
Nomenclature, generic affiliation and taxonomy: Dileptus falciformis Dumas, 1930 is a senior primary
homonym of D. falciformis kahl, 1931 which we, however, assign to Pseudomonilicaryon because it
has a Dileptus-like oral ciliary pattern and a moniliform macronucleus. Thus, according to Article 23.9.5
of the ICZN (1999) kahl’s name must not be replaced. Moreover, Dileptus falciformis Dumas, 1930 is
considered a nomen dubium because of the insufficient description and the lack of original material.
388

©Biologiezentrum Linz, Austria; download unter www.biologiezentrum.at
kahl (1931) established D. falciformis with the peculiar arrangement of the extrusomes, both in the
proboscis oral bulge and in the oral bulge opening, while most dileptids have extrusomes only in the bulge
of the proboscis. Dragesco (1963) recognized kahl’s species but, unfortunately, omitted this important
feature.
In Austria and Hawaii, we found populations matching D. falciformis in most important features, such as
body shape and size, the nuclear apparatus and, especially, the peculiar extrusome pattern. The arrangement
of the contractile vacuoles is, however, different: kahl’s specimens have only dorsal vacuoles, while the
Austrian and Hawaiian cells show both, ventral and dorsal vacuoles. Nevertheless, it appears reasonable
to emphasize the matching features and to identify both populations as D. falciformis, especially because
the ventral vacuoles are sparse and thus possibly easily overlooked. On the other hand, the differences are
too pronounced for a neotypification at the present state of knowledge.
The Austrian and Hawaiian specimens differ in body width (on average 66 μm vs. 45 μm), the length:width
ratio (4 vs. 7:1), and the number of ciliary rows (45 vs. 35). While some difference in the first two features is
very likely caused by the preparation procedures and culture conditions, the kinety number is considerably
(22%) lower in the Hawaiian specimens, suggesting some biogeographic specialization.
Within dileptids with moniliform macronucleus, D. falciformis is outstanding in having (i) extrusomes
anchored both in the proboscis oral bulge and in the oral bulge opening and (ii) an anterior tail in the
ventralmost rows of the dorsal brush. The first feature occurs only in two other dileptids, viz., in the
multinucleate D. costaricanus and in the binucleate Rimaleptus canadensis. The second feature occurs
only in two congeners: P. edaphoni and P. fraterculum. However, P. edaphoni has only four (vs. more than
ten) macronuclear nodules and 22 (vs. 40) ciliary rows, and P. fraterculum has a much larger body (600
µm vs. 350 µm) with very long (vs. ordinary) proboscis.
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 350 × 50 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
to cylindroidally dileptid with acute posterior end, proboscis about 1/3 of body length. Macronucleus
moniliform, usually composed of about 20 globular to oblong nodules; several globular micronuclei.
A dorsal and a ventral stripe of contractile vacuoles with 1 pore each. Two types of extrusomes: type I
attached to proboscis oral bulge, very narrowly ovate, slightly curved, about 7 × 0.8 μm in size; type II
forms a ring in oral bulge opening, ovate and almost straight, about 1.5–2 × 1 μm in size. On average
40 ciliary rows, up to 12 anteriorly differentiated into a multi-rowed, staggered, distinctly heterostichad
dorsal brush with monokinetidal tails extending anteriorly and posteriorly. Oral bulge opening about 14
μm across. On average 51 ordinarily to widely spaced, strongly oblique preoral kineties, each usually
composed of 3 narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Moss on limestones from the surroundings of the town of Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany,
E12°58’ N47°37’.
Type and voucher material: No type material is available from kahl’s specimens. Two voucher slides
(inv. nos 2011/185 and 2011/186) with Austrian protargol-impregnated specimens and eight protargol
voucher slides (inv. nos 2011/187–194) with Hawaiian specimens have been deposited in the Biology
Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles
on the coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Latin noun falx (sickle) and the suffix
form (shaped), obviously referring to the sickle-like (falciform) curved proboscis.
Description: Size usually about 350 × 50 μm in vivo; German type specimens 300–450 μm long, Austrian
cells 270–370 × 40–70 μm in size, and Hawaiian individuals 280–500 × 35–70 μm; very flexible but
not contractile. Shape in vivo narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid, that is, length:width ratio about 7:1 in

μm, impregnate deeply and homogenously. On average 11 micronuclei attached to macronuclear nodules,
about 2.5 μm across in prepared specimens and thus small compared to cell size (Figs 121a, c, d, i, k–n,
t–y, 122a, c; Table 60). A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles in type specimen (Fig. 121c), while a dorsal
and ventral stripe both in Austrian and Hawaiian cells, ventral vacuoles less numerous than dorsal ones;
first dorsal vacuole in proximal half or third of proboscis; each vacuole with a single, intrakinetal excretory
pore about 2 μm across (Figs 121a, i). Two types of extrusomes not impregnating with protargol: type I
rather sparse, obliquely attached with thin end to both bulge branches in type and Hawaiian specimens,
while forming a single row in Austrian cells, very narrowly ovate with minute globular dome, slightly
curved, and about 7 × 0.8 μm in size; when exploded with typical toxicyst structure, viz., about 15 μm
long and with a refractive granule at distal end of tube emerging from the empty capsule (Fig. 121h); type
II forms a conspicuous ring in oral bulge opening, ovate and almost straight, about 1.5–2 × 1 μm in size
(Figs 121a, c, g, o, 122d–h). Cortex flexible, about 1.5 µm thick and distinctly separated from cytoplasm,
contains about five oblique granule rows between each two kineties; granules narrowly spaced in somatic
and oral bulge cortex, 1 × 0.5 µm in size (Figs 121e, f). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline in proboscis,
opaque and brownish in trunk due to numerous lipid droplets 1–5 μm across; in posterior end of trunk
sometimes a defecation vacuole with sparse contents.
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e.,
with thick, strongly impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of 45
longitudinal, narrowly spaced rows in Austrian cells and in 35 rows in Hawaiian specimens; frequently
with irregularities, e.g., some rows shortened anteriorly or posteriorly, and/or with short breaks (Fig. 121i;
Table 60). Right side ciliary rows shortened only near anterior end of oral bulge; cilia of perioral kinety
ordinarily spaced (Figs 121j, r, 122b). Blank stripe on left side of proboscis distinct, although most ciliary
rows extend to or above proximal half of proboscis (Figs 121i, p, q, 122l, m). Dorsal brush extends on
dorsal and left side of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; composed of up to twelve rows with
loosely to ordinarily spaced dikinetids associated in Hawaiian specimens with 2.5 μm long, inflated, curved
type I bristles becoming rod-shaped in protargol preparations; frequently with small irregularities, such as
breaks or some extra dikinetids forming short additional rows. Some ventralmost brush rows commence in
distal proboscis half with a monokinetidal tail of one to ten ordinary cilia, while the more dorsally located
rows begin, as usual, with dikinetidal bristles. Posteriorly, all rows continue with a monokinetidal tail of 1
μm long, oblong type VI bristles ending at level of oral opening (Figs 121i, p, q, s, 122i, k, m).
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body third; hardly projecting in type and Hawaiian specimens,
while ordinarily projecting in Austrian cells; small as compared to body size, i.e., about 14 µm across in
protargol preparations and thus occupying less than 5% of body length (Figs 121a, b, c, g, o, 122a; Table
60). Pharyngeal basket difficult to recognize both in vivo and in protargol preparations because composed
of very fine and faintly impregnated rods (Figs 121i, j). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced
dikinetids, except for narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening (Fig. 121j). On average

51 ordinarily to widely spaced preoral kineties each composed of two to five, usually three narrowly
spaced kinetids, forming oblique to strongly oblique rows occasionally almost in line with left branch of
circumoral kinety (Figs 121i, p, q, 122j, l, m).
Occurrence and ecology: Pseudomonilicaryon falciforme was discovered by kahl (1931) in moss on
limestones from the surroundings of the town of Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany. Further, it was found
in moss from the Erlangen area, also in Bavaria, by wenzel (1953); very rare in soil from an oak-hornbeam
forest on the Johannser Kogel in the surroundings of the town of Vienna (see Foissner et al. 2005 for
detailed site description); and in a mixture of soil, mud, and dry leaf litter from flat lava rockpools in a
temporary river of the Pu’uhonua O Honau Nau area, Hawaii. wang (1977) reported it from the Tibetan
Plateau, and yang (1989) found it during winter in freshwaters of the Yuelushan area, China.

Nomenclature and taxonomy: Foissner (1989) neotypified P. gracile with a Bavarian population without
providing the reasons. However, we support neotypification because (i) no type material is available from
kahl’s (1931) specimens, (ii) the identidy of the species is threatened by several similar species, such as
P. anguillula, (iii) the neotype is from a similar habitat, and (iv) the protargol preparations are of sufficient
quality. The neotype is here classified as a distinct subspecies (P. gracile antevacuolatum). This might pose
nomenclatural problems in future, especially when P. gracile antevacuolatum is a distinct species; then,
it would be a misidentified neotype. If further research shows that the location of the anterior contractile
vacuole is variable, then P. gracile antevacuolatum merges into P. gracile and can be used as a neotype.
We split this species into four subspecies, according to the shape of the rear body end (rounded in P.
gracile gracile, P. gracile antevacuolatum and P. gracile oviplites, acute to tail-like in P. gracile singulare),
the shape of the extrusomes (rod-like in P. gracile antevacuolatum, very narrowly ovate in P. gracile
oviplites), and the location of the anterior contractile vacuole (far underneath oral bulge opening in P.
gracile gracile and P. gracile singulare, at level of oral bulge opening in P. gracile antevacuolatum and P.
gracile oviplites). Two groups can be recognized: (i) P. gracile gracile and P. gracile singulare with the
anterior vacuole far underneath the oral bulge opening, ≤ 10 ciliary rows, and short to ordinary proboscis
and (ii) P. gracile antevacuolatum and P. gracile oviplites with anterior vacuole at level of oral bulge
opening, about 16 ciliary rows, and ordinary to long proboscis.
As mentioned by kahl (1931), P. gracile is very similar to Dileptus anguillula (now Pseudomonilicaryon
anguillula) which has, however, a different contractile vacuole pattern (a dorsal row vs. two dorsal
vacuoles) and fewer ciliary rows (8–12 vs. 14–19).
Improved diagnosis (includes four subspecies): Size about 110–230 × 20–30 μm in vivo. Shape very
narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with rounded or acute posterior end, proboscis 25–57% of body
length. Macronucleus moniliform and tortuous, composed of about 13 nodules on average; 6 globular to
ellipsoidal micronuclei. Two dorsal contractile vacuoles with 2–5 excretory pores each, anterior vacuole
at level of oral bulge opening or far underneath. Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge:
type I rod-shaped or very narrowly ovate, 4–6 × 0.8 μm in size; type II oblong, 2–2.5 μm long. On average
16 ciliary rows, 2 staggered and differentiated into an inconspicuous dorsal brush with bristles 2–3 μm
long: brush rows 1 and 2 composed of an average of 22 and 31 dikinetids, respectively; both rows with
395

a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening about 12 μm across. On
average 32 widely spaced, strongly oblique preoral kineties, each composed of 2–3 narrowly to ordinarily
spaced cilia.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective gracilis (slender) obviously refers to
body shape.

Diagnosis: Body rounded posteriorly. Anterior contractile vacuole far underneath oral bulge opening.
Type locality: Moss from Wisconsin, USA, W88°47’ N43°47’.
Type material: No material available from kahl’s specimens.
Description: Length 100–120 μm in vivo. Shape cylindroidally dileptid with a length:width ratio of 10:1,
according to the figure provided. Proboscis about one fourth of body length, indistinctly set off from
cylindroidal trunk; posterior end rounded. Macronucleus moniliform, composed of eight nodules, as
estimated from kahl’s illustration (Fig. 123b). Two contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk: anterior
vacuole at beginning of second fourth of trunk, posterior vacuole at beginning of last fourth of trunk.
Extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge, their shape not described but illustrated as short rods (Fig.
123b). Number of ciliary rows not studied, but kahl (1931) showed five rows on one side of cell, indicating
about ten rows in total. Oral basket minute and short.
Occurrence and ecology: Pseudomonilicaryon gracile gracile was discovered by kahl (1931) in
moss from Wisconsin, USA, where only ten specimens were found. Later records not substantiated
by illustrations, possibly including D. gracile antevacuolatum: frequent in an activated sludge plant in
London, England (reiD 1969); soil from spruce forests in Austria and Germany (aescht & Foissner 1993,
Foissner 1998); rendzic leptosol from a pine forest in the Stampfltal, Lower Austria (Foissner et al. 2005);
mosses (Bryum argenteum, Ceratodon purpureus and Brachythecium albicans) on carbonaceous fluvisol
from the town of Bratislava, Slovakia (anDeloVá & tirJakoVá 2000); in the periphyton of the Tisa River,
Ukraine (koValchuk 1997a); strongly rooted, reddish surface (0–5 cm) soil from the Mt. Fields National
Park, Tasmania, pH 7.0 (Blatterer & Foissner 1988).
Remarks: Detailed redescription urgently needed, with special regard to the contractile vacuoles.

1962 Dileptus singularis n. sp. VuXanoVici, Studii Cerc. Biol. 14: 333
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: Jankowski (1967) did not assigned Dileptus singularis to one of his
subgenera. Indeed, the generic home of this rather poorly described species remains doubtful because
its oral ciliature is not known. We suggest to combine D. singularis with Pseudomonilicaryon and as a
subspecies of P. gracile. Pseudomonilicaryon gracile singulare highly resembles P. gracile gracile in
body size, the nuclear apparatus, and the contractile vacuole pattern, but has an acute or tail-like (vs.
rounded) rear end. As VuXanoVici (1962) found many specimens, the acute body end is very likely correct,
396

representing the typical state. Further, it is a limnetic (vs. moss) species. Full redescription is required.
Diagnosis: Body acute to tail-like posteriorly. Anterior contractile vacuole far underneath oral bulge
opening.
Type locality: Coast of Lake Herǎstrǎu, Bucharest, Roumania, in March 1960, E26°05’ N44°28’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective singularis (single) possibly refers to its
uniqueness, i.e., being a new species.
Description: Length 120–160 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of 6:1,
according to the figure provided. Proboscis about one third of body length, distinctly set off from trunk,
slightly curved dorsally; trunk obconical; posterior end tail-like. Macronucleus moniliform, composed
of about 10 nodules. Micronuclei, extrusomes, and number of ciliary rows not known. Two contractile
vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk: anterior vacuole at end of first fourth of trunk, posterior one at beginning
of last fourth of trunk. Cytoplasm transparent, hyaline in proboscis while opaque in trunk because packed
with granules. Oral basket minute and short (Fig. 123a).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, where many specimens were observed.
Pseudomonilicaryon gracile antevacuolatum nov. ssp. (Figs 123c–k; Table 61)
1989 Dileptus gracilis kahl, 1931 – Foissner, Sber. Akad. Wiss. Wien 196: 182 (misidentification)
Taxonomy: We establish a new subspecies P. gracile antevacuolatum. We use “nov. ssp.” instead of “nom.
nov.” because we fix here a holotype (Article 72.3 of the ICZN 1999; see Type material).
Pseudomonilicaryon gracile antevacuolatum differs from the nominotypical subspecies by the longer
proboscis (33–47% vs. 25% of body length), the location of the anterior contractile vacuole (at level vs.
far underneath of oral bulge opening), and, possibly, also by the higher number of ciliary rows (~ 15 vs. ~
10). The most important feature is possibly the location of the anterior vacuole because this is found also
in the subspecies P. gracile oviplites (see below).
Diagnosis: Body rounded posteriorly. Anterior contractile vacuole at level of oral bulge opening. Type I
extrusomes rod-shaped with rounded ends, 4–6 μm long.
Type locality: Moss from the Schönramer Filz close to the town of Freilassing, Bavaria, Germany, E12°59’
N47°51’.
Type material: Foissner (1989) deposited two neotype slides (inv. nos 1988/98 and 1988/99; designated
as Dileptus gracilis) with protargol-impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip. See,
“nomenclature and taxonomy” of Pseudomonilicaryon gracile.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin prefix ante (in front) and the Latin noun vacuola (vacuole), referring
to the anterior contractile vacuole vis-à-vis the oral bulge opening.
Description: Body size in vivo 100–200 × 25–40 μm, usually about 150 × 25 μm, according to the
protargol-prepared cells (Table 61), when 15% shrinkage is added; very flexible but not contractile. Shape
narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid, that is, length:width ratio 5.2–9.2:1 (Table 61). Length of proboscis
highly variable, about one third of body length in small cells (100–130 μm), while almost one half of
body length in large specimens (140–200 μm), usually curved dorsally; trunk elongate ellopsoidal to
cylindroidal with posterior end rounded, never tail-like (Figs 123b, i–k; Table 61). Nuclear apparatus in
anterior two thirds of trunk (Figs 123c, j). Macronucleus an irregularly nodulated and highly tortuous
strand, consisting of an average of ten nodules connected by fine argyrophilic bridges; nucleoli globular,

small to medium-sized. On average five micronuclei close to or attached to macronuclear strand, about 2
μm across in prepared specimens (Figs 123c, h, j; Table 61). Two dorsal contractile vacuoles each with
two to three intrakinetal pores (Figs 123c, i, k): anterior vacuole at level of or slightly posterior to oral
bulge opening, posterior vacuole at beginning of last fourth of trunk. Extrusomes scattered throughout
cytoplasm and attached to proboscis oral bulge, quite similar in South African and German specimens,
where the small type possibly has been overlooked (Figs 123f, g): type I rod-shaped with rounded ends,
4 μm and 6 μm long in German and South African specimens, respectively; type II extrusomes oblong,
about 2 μm long. Cortex flexible, contains about three rows of loosely spaced, colourless, about 1 μm long
granules between adjacent kineties (Fig. 123e). Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to many lipid droplets
1–5 μm across; near posterior end often a defecation vacuole. Slowly glides on microscope slide.
On average 15 longitudinal, ordinarily spaced ciliary rows leaving a wide, blank stripe left and right of
oral bulge (Figs 123i, j; Table 61). First row right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety with
ordinarily spaced cilia to tip of proboscis. Only one ciliary row between perioral kinety and brush row
2 (Fig. 123i). Dorsal brush composed of two isostichad rows. Both rows begin subapically and continue
with a monokinetidal tail. Brush dikinetids ordinarily spaced, associated with 2–3 μm long bristles (Fig.
123j; Table 61).
Oral bulge opening roundish both in vivo and in preparations, about 12 μm across, ordinarily projecting
(Figs 123d, h; Table 61). Pharyngeal basket possibly bulbous, distinct both in vivo and after protargol
impregnation. Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced dikinetids in proboscis and of narrowly
spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening (Figs 123h–j). Preoral kineties widely spaced, oblique to
strongly oblique, each composed of two to three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 123h, j).
Occurrence and ecology: Foissner (1989) discovered P. gracile antevacuolatum in moss from the
Schönramer Filz close to the town of Freilassing, Bavaria, Germany. Possibly occurs also in soil from the
Republic of South Africa (see extrusomes).

Type locality: Soil and mud from a rockpool on granitic outgrowths (Lajas) in the surroundings of the
farm of Mr. eisenBerg, about 50 km NE of Puerto Ayacucho, Venezuela, W67°20’ N6°10’.
Type material: One holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/178) and six paratype slides (inv. nos 2011/179–184)
with protargol-impregnated specimens have been deposited in the Biology Centre of the Museum of
Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Latin noun ovum (egg), the thematic vowel i, and the Greek noun hoplites
(soldier ~ extrusome), referring to the very narrowly ovate extrusomes.
Description: Size 170–300 × 20–40 μm in vivo, usually about 230 × 30 μm, as calculated from some in
vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming 15% preparation shrinkage; very flexible but
not contractile (Table 61). Shape narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid, length:width ratio near 9:1 both in
vivo and in protargol preparations. Length of proboscis highly variable, viz., 27% to 57%, on average 40%
of body length, usually curved dorsally; trunk cylindroidal, broadly fusiform in some prepared specimens,
distinctly inflated in cells with large food inclusions (Fig. 124c); posterior end rounded both in vivo and in
protargol preparations, never tail-like (Figs 124a–f, l, m; Table 61). Nuclear apparatus usually in anterior
three fourth of trunk, may be dislocated by large food items. Macronucleus moniliform, tortuous, in some
specimens a mixture of nodules and distinctly nodulated strands, about 120 μm long when “uncoiled”,
composed of an average of 15 oblong nodules connected by argyrophilic strands; individual nodules
ellipsoidal to very narrowly ellipsoidal, on average 8 × 4 μm in size; nucleoli small, globular. On average
seven micronuclei attached to macronuclear strand, broadly ellipsoidal to ellipsoidal, about 2.5 × 1.5 μm
in size (Figs 124a–f, m, o; Table 61). Two dorsal contractile vacuoles each with two to five intrakinetal
pores one after the other: anterior vacuole at level of oral bulge opening, posterior one at beginning of last
fourth of trunk (Figs 124f, m, n). Two types of extrusomes, not impregnating with protargol, attached to
broader right branch of oral bulge: type I very narrowly ovate, about 5–6 × 0.8 μm in size; type II oblong
with rounded ends, 2.5 μm long; developing extrusomes numerous in trunk cytoplasm, very narrowly
ovate, impregnate with protargol (Figs 124h, j, m, n). Cortex flexible, contains about seven granule rows
between adjacent kineties; granules narrowly spaced in somatic and oral bulge cortex, colourless and
about 0.8 × 0.3 µm in size (Figs 124h, i). Cytoplasm colourless, contains few to many globular and
irregular lipid droplets 1–10 μm across and large food vacuoles with small rotifers (Figs 124c, f).
Cilia about 8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e., with
thick, deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of 17 longitudinal,
ordinarily spaced rows leaving a wide, blank stripe left and right of oral bulge (Figs 124l–n, p–s; Table 61).
First row right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety with ordinarily to widely spaced cilia to tip
of proboscis (Figs 124l, r). Invariably only one ciliary row between perioral kinety and brush row 2 (Figs
124l, n, p, q). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, composed of two staggered, isostichad
rows. Row 1 commences slightly more subapically than row 2, composed of an average of 22 dikinetids.
Row 2 begins near tip of proboscis, composed of an average of 31 dikinetids. Brush dikinetids very
loosely spaced in anterior portion of rows, while loosely to ordinarily in posterior half; associated with
type IV bristles being 2.5 μm long in vivo and becoming 1.5–2 μm long and rod-shaped after protargol
impregnation. Both brush rows continue to base of proboscis with a monokinetidal tail composed of about
2 μm long type VI bristles (Figs 124f, g, k–n, p, q).
Oral bulge opening roundish both in vivo and in preparations, about 12 μm across, projects distinctly
because proboscis only half as wide as trunk (Figs 124f, h; Table 61). Pharyngeal basket obconical,
difficult to recognize both in vivo and in protargol preparations because composed of very fine and faintly
impregnated rods (Figs 124l–n). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily to widely spaced dikinetids
in proboscis, while of narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening; right branch curves

around anterior end of proboscis, while left branch ends subapically almost touching the curved right end
(Figs 124l–n, r, s). On average 32 widely spaced, strongly oblique preoral kineties, each composed of two
to three narrowly to ordinarily spaced cilia; some almost in line with left branch of circumoral kinety,
especially in anterior portion of proboscis (Figs 124m, n, p, q, s; Table 61).
Occurrence and ecology: As yet found only at type locality, that is, in mud and soil of a rather large
rockpool on granitic outgrowths called “Lajas” in Venezuela. The sample, which had pH 5.4 in water,
consisted of the up to 3 cm deep, grey-brown, sandy mud and soil accumulated between some moss and a
dense lawn of velosiaceans, a group of plants endemic to South America.

Pseudomonilicaryon thononense (dragEsco, 1960) nov. comb. (Figs 125a–d, 126a–t;
Table 62)
1960 Dileptus thononensis n. sp. Dragesco, Trav. Stn biol. Roscoff (N. S.) 12: 188
1963 Dileptus thononensis Dragesco, 1960 – Dragesco, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 117 (first taxonomic reviser)
Generic affiliation and taxonomy: Jankowski (1967) did not combine Dileptus thononensis with one of
his subgenera. Our data show that it belongs to Pseudomonilicaryon because it has a Dileptus-like ciliary
pattern and a moniliform macronucleus.
In Venezuela, we found a population fairly similar to Pseudomonilicaryon thononense: body about
250–350 μm long and very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with distinct tail and proboscis occupying
1/3–1/2 of body length; macronucleus moniliform, several globular micronuclei; contractile vacuoles in
a dorsal stripe. Details of the nuclear apparatus are, however, rather different: Dragesco’s specimens
had much more micronuclei (15–16 vs. 4–9) and macronuclear nodules (60–70 vs. 20–34), each having
a big central nucleolus (vs. several small nucleoli). Nevertheless, it appears reasonable to emphasize the
matching features and to identify the Venezuelan population as Dileptus thononensis, especially because
there is evidence that Dragesco (1960) strongly over-estimated the number of macronuclear nodules: if
there are 60–70 of them, each about 6 μm across, they would occupy 270–315 μm, even when 25% space
is added for a zigzagging arrangement. On the other hand, we do not neotypify D. thononensis with the
Venezuelan population because this is a different biogeographic region and data about the extrusomes and
the number of ciliary rows are lacking from the French population.
There are several Pseudomonilicaryon species which resemble P. thononense, viz., P. massutii, P.
japonicum, and P. angustistoma. However, all have, inter alia, a much higher number of ciliary rows
(about 40 vs. 18). Another similar species is P. kahli which, however, is much larger (450–900 μm vs.
250–370 μm) and possesses more ciliary rows (22–27 vs. 17–21).
Improved diagnosis (based on literature and a new population from Venezuela): Size about 250–300 × 35
μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with distinct tail, proboscis about 37% of body
length. Macronucleus moniliform, composed of about 25–70 (?) globular to ellipsoidal nodules; several
globular micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles with 1–3 pores each. Two size-types (6 μm
and 2–2.5 μm) of rod-shaped extrusomes attached to right branch of oral bulge. On average 18 ciliary
rows; dorsal brush diffuse, staggered, all rows with a monokinetidal tail extending to base of proboscis.
Oral bulge opening about 15 μm across. On average 43 ordinarily spaced, oblique preoral kineties, each
usually composed of 3 ordinarily spaced cilia.
Type locality: Dragesco (1960) discovered Dileptus thononensis in fine sand from Lake Léman, Thonon
region, France, E6°21’ N46°21’.
Type and voucher material: No type material is available from Dragesco’s specimens. Eight voucher
slides (inv. nos 2011/170–177) with protargol-impregnated Venezuelan specimens have been deposited in
the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black
ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: Dragesco (1960) named this species after the region in which the species was discovered
(Thonon, France).
Description of Thonon population: The original description by Dragesco (1960) reads as follows (Figs
125a–c): “Cette nouvelle espèce, trouvée dans le sable fin d’Excenevex, pendand l’hiver 1955–1956,
rappelled un peu D. marinus, mais se différencie de toutes les espèce du genre par sa petite taille (250

efilée. La trompe est courte, relativement épaisse et semble peu mobile. Les vacuoles pulsatiles montrent
la dispostion habituelle: grande vacuole caudale et petites vacuoles satellites dorsales. Les espaces
intercinétiques sont garnis de très fins protrichocystes. La bouche, du type habituel, est armée de fines
baguettes squelettiques”.
Description of Venezuelan population: Size 250–370 × 25–40 μm in vivo, usually about 300 × 35 μm,
as calculated from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming 15% preparation
shrinkage (Table 62). Shape very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid, length:width ratio near 9:1 both in
vivo and in protargol preparations. Proboscis about one third to one half of body length, usually curved
dorsally, anterior fifth sometimes coiled; trunk fusiform both in vivo and in preparations, distinctly inflated
in well-fed specimens (Fig. 126o); posterior in vivo with distinct tail often becoming indistinct or acute
in protargol preparations (Figs 126a, e, f, o, q–t; Table 62). Nuclear apparatus extends between oral bulge
opening and base of tail. Macronucleus a moniliform, basically straight strand composed of 20–34, on
average of 25 nodules; individual nodules rather variable in shape and size, that is, globular to narrowly
ellipsoidal, sometimes surrounded by a distinct membrane after protargol impregnation; in mid-dividers
fuse to an ellipsoidal mass (Fig. 126k), becoming a long rod in early post-dividers (Fig. 126b); many
nucleoli about 1–2 μm across, well recognizable both in vivo and in protargol preparations. On average six
micronuclei attached to macronuclear nodules, about 2.5 μm across in prepared specimens (Figs 126a, e, f,
m, o, q–t; Table 62). A stripe of contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of cell, first vacuole slightly anterior of
oral bulge opening; no ventral vacuoles; one to three, usually two intrakinetal excretory pores per vacuole
(Figs 126a, e, l). Two size-types of rod-shaped extrusomes with rounded ends, not impregnating with
protargol, scattered throughout cytoplasm and attached to right broader branch of oral bulge: type I about
5–6.5 × 0.8 μm in size, certain cytoplasmic developmental stages sometimes impregnate with protargol;

type II about 2–2.5 μm long (Figs 126c, d). Cortex flexible, contains about five rows of granules between
adjacent kineties; individual granules ~ 1 × 0.4 μm in size (Figs 126g, h). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline
in proboscis and tail, opaque in trunk because packed with globular and irregular lipid droplets 1–5 μm
across and 10–20 μm-sized food vacuoles containing mainly Protocyclidium terricola, rarely Vorticellides
astyliformis; in trunk end sometimes a defecation vacuole with crystalline contents (Figs 126a, f, o).
Swims fairly rapidly by rotation about main body axis and roots between soil particles.
Cilia about 10 μm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e., with
thick, deeply impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of 18 longitudinal,
ordinarily spaced rows two to three anteriorly gradually shortened along right side of oral bulge; perioral
kinety extends to tip of proboscis with ordinarily spaced basal bodies (Figs 126e, f, l; Table 62). Left side
of proboscis with conspicuous blank stripe because some ciliary rows end left of oral bulge opening (Figs
126f, i, j). Dorsal brush a long, narrow field on dorsal and dorsolateral surface of proboscis; distinctly

heterostichad; diffuse and composed of at least four rows (Figs 126e, f, i, j). Brush dikinetids with type I
bristles both being about 3 μm long; brush tails end at level of oral bulge opening, composed of 2 μm long
type VI bristles (Figs 126a, n).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, roundish both in vivo and in preparations, about
15 μm across, projects distinctly because proboscis only half as wide as trunk (Figs 126a, c; Table
62). Pharyngeal basket obconical, distinct both in vivo and in protargol preparations (Figs 126c, f, i,
l). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced dikinetids in proboscis, while of narrowly spaced
monokinetids around oral bulge opening; right branch curves around anterior end of proboscis, whereas
left branch ends subapically almost touching the curved right end. On average 43 ordinarily spaced preoral
kineties, each composed of two to four, usually three narrowly to ordinarily spaced cilia, forming oblique
to strongly oblique rows sometimes almost in line with left branch of circumoral kinety, especially in
anterior half of proboscis (Figs 126f, i, j; Table 62).
Notes on conjugation (Fig. 126p): The single pair found suggests that conjugation of Pseudomonilicaryon
thononense is highly similar to that of other dileptids, especially of Rimaleptus tirjakovae recently
described by Vďačný & Foissner (2008a): pair formation is heteropolar and the partners unite bulge-
to-bulge; conjugants are distinctly shorter (the longer partner is 160 μm, the shorter is 117 μm) than
morphostatic cells (~ 270 μm); the proboscis is reduced to a rounded triangular lip; the oral ciliary pattern
resembles that of polar haptorids; two globular pronuclei of similar size are formed in each partner; and
the vegetative macronuclear nodules condense to an ellipsoidal mass (Fig. 126p, arrows). Unlike R.
tirjakovae, the number of ciliary rows does not change (18 in the longer partner, 16 in the shorter, and 18
in vegetative cells), and all micronuclei perform the first and second maturation division, as suggested by
many degenerating maturation derivatives.
Occurrence and ecology: Dragesco (1960, 1963) discovered Pseudomonilicaryon thononense in fine sand
from the Excenevex beach, Lake Léman, France. Our population is from rockpools on granitic outgrowths
(called “Lajas”) between the Agricultural Research Institute and the airport of Puerto Ayacucho, Venezuela
(W75° S6°). The sample consisted of dark cyanobacterial mud mixed with aeolian soil deposits.

Diagnosis: Size about 140 × 15 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with posterior
end narrowly rounded, proboscis about 1/5 of body length. Macronucleus moniliform and tortuous,
composed of 11 nodules on average; usually two narrowly ellipsoidal micronuclei. Contractile vacuoles,
each with 1 excretory pore, in dorsal side of trunk: two close together in anterior third of trunk and
one vacuole in posterior third. Two types of extrusomes: type I oblong with conical anterior end, 2.5
× 1 μm in size; type II oblong with rounded ends, 2 μm long. On average 7 ciliary rows, 2 anteriorly
differentiated into a staggered, dimorphic, isostichad dorsal brush: brush row 1 composed of an average
of 7 widely spaced dikinetids, brush row 2 composed of 11 ordinarily spaced dikinetids; both rows with
a monokinetidal bristle tail extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening about 8 × 5 μm in size.
Circumoral kinety distinctly narrowed preorally. On average 8 widely spaced, strongly oblique preoral
kineties, each composed of two widely spaced cilia.

Type material: Vďačný & Foissner (2008b) deposited one holotype slide (inv. no. 2011/158) and eleven
paratype slides (inv. nos 2011/159–169) with protargol-impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre
of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek adjective brachy (short) and the Latin noun proboscis, referring to
the short proboscis, a main feature of the species.
Description: Size 120–150 × 10–20 μm in vivo, usually about 140 × 15 μm, as calculated from some
in vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming 15% preparation shrinkage; flexible but
not contractile. Shape very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid, length:width ratio on average near 9:1.
Proboscis occupies one fifth of body length on average, slightly curved dorsally, mid-region often inflated
in protargol preparations; trunk cylindroidal, rarely narrowly fusiform, ventral margin often rather distinctly
convex in mid of trunk, distinctly widened in well-fed specimens; posterior end narrowly rounded, never
tail-like (Figs 127a, c–e, k–o, t–w, 128a, d; Table 63). Nuclear apparatus usually in anterior two thirds of
trunk. Macronucleus highly variable, moniliform and tortuous, about 70 μm long in “uncoiled” condition,
composed of an average of 11 oblong nodules; nucleoli medium- to large-sized, globular or ellipsoidal.
One to four micronuclei, usually one micronucleus each near anterior and posterior end of macronucleus,
conspicuous because narrowly ellipsoidal, that is, 3 × 1 μm in size (Figs 127a, d, e, k–o, t–w, 128a, d, g;
Table 63). Contractile vacuoles in dorsal side of trunk, arranged in remarkable pattern, viz., two rather
close together in anterior third of trunk and one vacuole in posterior third, vacuoles thus lacking in mid-
body; rarely a third vacuole occurs in the anterior group and/or a second one in posterior third; usually a
single (very rarely two) intrakinetal excretory pore per vacuole (Figs 127a, c, 128a; Table 63). Two types
of extrusomes (Figs 127b, i, 128b): type I only in right branch of oral bulge, oblong with conical anterior
end, appears narrowly ovate (!) when slightly out of focal plane (Fig. 127i, asterisk), about 2.5 × 1 μm
in size, very rarely impregnates with protargol; type II in both bulge branches, more numerous than type
I, oblong with both ends rounded, 2 μm long, does not stain with the protargol method used; developing
cytoplasmic extrusomes sometimes impregnating with protargol, rod-shaped and 4 μm long or narrowly
ovate to oblong and 3 μm long, and thus difficult to distinguish from micronuclei (Fig. 127j). Cortex
flexible, contains about eight granule rows between adjacent kineties; granules colourless and ~ 0.5 ×
0.2 μm in size. Cytoplasm colourless, in well-fed specimens packed with lipid droplets 1–3 μm across
and 5 μm-sized food vacuoles with indefinable or crystalline contents; in posterior body end sometimes a
defecation vacuole. Movement without peculiarities.
Cilia about 6 μm long in vivo, ordinarily spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e.,
with thick, strongly impregnated distal half, except for dorsal bristles; arranged in an average of seven
longitudinal, ordinarily spaced rows leaving a rather wide, blank stripe left and right of oral bulge (Figs
127c–e; Table 63). First row right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety with ordinarily to widely
spaced cilia to tip of proboscis (Figs 127c, e, p). Invariably only one ciliary row between perioral kinety
and brush row 2 (Figs 127c, p). Dorsal brush pattern highly specific and constant, that is, two dimorphic,
staggered rows in over 700 specimens analyzed; a few, likely distorted cells have either three staggered
rows (two specimens) or some irregularities in row 1 (one specimen; Figs 127r, s). Brush row 1 commences
slightly more subapically than row 2, composed of an average of seven widely spaced dikinetids each
having an about 3 μm long, slightly inflated anterior bristle and an about 2 μm long, oblong posterior
bristle in protargol preparations. Brush row 2 begins near tip of proboscis, its anterior portion usually
slightly curved rightwards, composed of an average of 11 ordinarily spaced dikinetids each associated
with bristles similar to those of row 1, but anterior bristle not inflated (Figs 127c, d, g, h, p, q, 128c, e, f;
Table 63). Bristles 4 μm long subapically, decreasing in length anteriorly and posteriorly according to the

live observations (Fig. 127f). Both rows continue with a short monokinetidal tail composed of about 2 μm
long type VI bristles (Figs 127a, c, d, g, p–r).
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body fifth, ovate to broadly ovate, in vivo about 6 μm across (Fig.
127b; Table 63). Pharyngeal basket small, internal basket indistinctly bulbous both in vivo and after
protargol impregnation, external basket impregnated only in distal portion. Oral ciliary pattern basically
as in other dileptids, but with a special feature, viz., a distinct preoral narrowing of the circumoral kinety/
oral bulge (Figs 127d, e). Circumoral kinety composed of ordinarily spaced dikinetids, except of narrowly
spaced monokinetids around oral bulge opening. On average eight widely spaced, strongly oblique preoral
kineties, each composed of only two, rarely three widely spaced cilia (Figs 127d, q, r, 128f).
Notes on ontogenesis (Figs 129a–r; Table 64): The ontogenesis basically agrees with that of
Monomacrocaryon terrenum (Vďačný & Foissner 2009). The following peculiarities are probably genus-
or species-specific: (i) early dividers display a transient indentation in the prospective fission area, just
as known from several spathidiids (Figs 129k, l, arrowheads); (ii) the anterior portion of two right side
ciliary rows generates the new perioral kinety, but the more dorsally located kinety contributes fewer
kinetids than the more ventrally located one (1–4 vs. ~ 10 kinetids; Figs 129e, f, j, arrowheads); (iii) the
preoral kineties are very likely produced by only one kinety – the first row right of the dorsal brush (Figs
129g–i); possibly brush row 1 is also involved in this process (Fig. 129g); (iv) the staggered pattern of the
dorsal brush rows and the dimorphic arrangement of the dikinetids develop post-divisionally (Figs 129e,
h–i); and (v) the micronucleus massively changes its shape from narrowly ellipsoidal (3 × 1 μm in size) to
globular (~ 4 μm in diameter) during early ontogenesis (cp. Figs 127d, e, 128g, 129l with Figs 129m, o–q,
arrows; Table 64), and becomes narrowly ellipsoidal again in late dividers, when the fused macronuclear
nodules commence division (Fig. 129r).
Occurrence and ecology: Pseudomonilicaryon brachyproboscis was rather abundant in the non-flooded
Petri dish culture from the type locality, where the litter layer was thin, poorly decomposed, but locally

proboscis. The dorsal brush consists of two staggered and dimorphic rows, that is, row 1 commences slightly more
subapically than row 2 (arrowhead) and consists of loosely spaced dikinetids, while row 2 has ordinarily spaced
dikinetids; d – ventral view of a representative specimen, showing the slender body and moniliform macronucleus;
f – left side ciliary pattern in anterior body portion. The widely spaced preoral kineties are strongly oblique and
composed of two to three widely spaced basal bodies; g – the nuclear apparatus consists of a highly tortuous,
moniliform macronuclear strand and two narrowly ellipsoidal micronuclei (arrows), one each near the anterior and
posterior end of the macronuclear strand. B(1, 2) – dorsal brush (rows), CK – circumoral kinety, E – extrusomes,

penetrated by moss and masses of fungal hyphae. The sample consisted of a mixture of Pinus needles and
terrestrial mosses; pH 6.3. A second population was found in slightly saline soil from the margin of the
Zicklacke, a saline inland lake in Burgenland, Austria.
Remarks: Pseudomonilicaryon brachyproboscis is unique in having narrowly ellipsoidal micronuclei, an
unusual shape as yet not found in other dileptids, but present in some spathidiids (e.g., Arcuospathidium
namibiense and A. etoschense; Foissner & Xu 2007) and bryophyllids (e.g., Apobryophyllum vermiforme;
Foissner et al. 2002). Further, Pseudomonilicaryon brachyproboscis displays a curious contractile vacuole
pattern, which is rather constant and is thus possibly a reliable feature of this species. These two basic
differences are not included in the following comparison. There are only two congeners similar to P.
brachyproboscis, viz., P. gracile and P. anguillula. However, P. gracile differs from P. brachyproboscis by
the much higher number of ciliary rows (15 vs. 7), and P. anguillula is distinguished from P. brachyproboscis
by the shape of the extrusomes (finely rod-shaped vs. oblong with conical anterior end). A further similar
species is Microdileptus breviproboscis which, however, is binucleate.

a Very early dividers are characterized by the proliferation of basal bodies in mid-body, while early dividers have developed oral
kinetofragments. Early mid-dividers have a continuous circumoral kinety on both sides of the cell.
non Dileptus anguillula kahl – Foissner, agatha, & Berger, Denisia 5: 38 (par lapsus, see R. brasiliensis)
Generic affiliation, taxonomy and nomenclature: Jankowski (1967) did not combine Dileptus anguillula
with one of his subgenera. Our data show that it belongs to Pseudomonilicaryon because it has a Dileptus-
like oral ciliary pattern and a moniliform macronucleus. Pseudomonilicaryon anguillula is most similar
to P. brachyproboscis, Microdileptus breviproboscis, and Rimaleptus brasiliense in having a slender body
with short proboscis and at least three dorsal contractile vacuoles (Table 41). However, P. anguillula
differs from them, except of P. brachyproboscis, by the macronuclear pattern (a moniliform strand vs.
two nodules). Pseudomonilicaryon anguillula is distinguished from P. brachyproboscis mainly by the
extrusomes (thin and rod-shaped vs. massive and oblong with conical anterior end) and the shape of the
micronuclei (globular vs. elongate ellipsoidal).
Improved diagnosis: Size about 140 × 20 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly to cylindroidally dileptid with
acute to narrowly rounded posterior end, proboscis about 1/5 of body length. Macronucleus moniliform
and tortuous, usually composed of about 9 nodules; 1–2 micronuclei. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoles.
Extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge, rod-shaped, 3–4 μm long. On average 10 ciliary rows, 2
anteriorly differentiated into a staggered, isostichad dorsal brush with bristles up to 4 μm long. Oral
bulge opening about 6 μm across. Circumoral kinety distinctly narrowed preorally. Preoral kineties widely
spaced, strongly oblique, each composed of 2–3 ordinarily to widely spaced kinetids.
Type locality: kahl (1931) did not specify the type locality, referring to Northern Germany and the
Austrian calcareous and granitic Alps.
Type and voucher material: Neither kahl (1931) nor Foissner (1984) deposited type or voucher material,
respectively (inv. nos 2007/781-785). Thus, we reinvestigated the population studied by Foissner (1984)
and have deposited three voucher slides with protargol-impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre
of the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the
coverslip.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin anguillula (little eel) is a noun in apposition,
obviously referring to the slender body of the species.
Description: Size about 140 × 20 μm in vivo: type specimens 120–150 μm long (kahl 1931), Austrian cells

140–170 × 15–20 μm in size as calculated from the morphometric data (Table 65), Singapore specimens
110–120 × 20–25 μm. Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape narrowly dileptid to rod-like, i.e.,
length:width ratio in type specimen about 14:1 and in an Austrian cell about 9:1 in vivo, according to the
figures provided; Austrian cells inflated in protargol preparations (Figs 130a–d, i–o; Table 65). Proboscis
indistinct because hardly set off from trunk and occupying only 22% body length on average, more or less
distinctly curved dorsally. Trunk oblong, sometimes widened in mid-portion after protargol impregnation,
posterior end acute to narrowly rounded (Figs 130a–d, i–o). Nuclear apparatus usually in middle quarters
of trunk. Macronucleus a moniliform strand of about nine oblong nodules in type specimens (kahl
1931) and of 6–11 nodules in Austrian cells, where two out of hundred specimens had only two nodules
(Foissner 1984 and new data; see Microdileptus breviproboscis); nucleoli globular to oblong, evenly
distributed. One or two micronuclei in between macronuclear nodules or attached to macronuclear strand,
about 2 μm across in protargol preparations (Figs 130a, b, i, j, l, n, o; Table 65). A dorsal row of four to
five contractile vacuoles: first vacuole at or slightly posterior of level of oral bulge opening (Figs 130a, b,
i); sometimes a pair of vacuoles each at anterior and near posterior end of trunk in Singapore specimens.
Extrusomes studied in several populations from Singapore, Canada and Brazil, attached to proboscis oral
bulge, inconspicuous, i.e., rod-shaped and only 3–4 μm long in vivo (Fig. 130p). Cortex very flexible,
contains three (Austrian specimens) to six (Singapore specimens) oblique granule rows between adjacent
kineties; granules about 0.2 μm across (Fig. 130h). Cytoplasm colourless, hyaline; in rear end sometimes
a defecation vacuole.
Cilia 7–8 μm long in vivo, ordinarily to narrowly spaced; arranged in an average of ten longitudinal,

ordinarily spaced rows leaving a rather wide, blank stripe left and right of oral bulge (Figs 130e, f, j,
k; Table 65). First row right of circumoral kinety extends as perioral kinety with widely spaced cilia
to tip of proboscis (Figs 130e, g, j, l). Only one ciliary row between perioral kinety and brush row 2
(Figs 130e, j). Dorsal brush exactly on dorsal side of proboscis, usually composed of two staggered,
isostichad rows both extending to base of proboscis with a monokinetidal tail of 1.5–2 μm long bristles;
two out of ten specimens, possibly distorted cells, with three staggered rows (Fig. 130m; Table 65). Brush
dikinetids loosely to ordinarily spaced and associated with clavate bristles both being about 2.5 µm long
after protargol impregnation in Austrian specimens (re-analysis of protargol-impregnated specimens).
Oral bulge opening at end of anterior body fifth, projects only slightly because base of proboscis almost
as wide as trunk, about 6 μm across in protargol preparations (Figs 130g, l, n, o; Table 65). Pharyngeal
basket possibly bulbous, internal basket impregnates more distinctly than external. Oral ciliary pattern
basically as in other dileptids, but with a special feature found also in P. brachyproboscis, viz., a preoral
narrowing of the circumoral kinety or oral bulge (Figs 130g, l). Circumoral kinety composed of widely
spaced dikinetids, except for narrowly spaced kinetids forming a line around oral bulge opening. About
11 widely spaced, strongly oblique preoral kineties, each composed of two to three ordinarily to widely
spaced cilia (Figs 130f, g, k, l).
Occurrence and ecology: Some of the faunistic data on P. anguillula very likely refer to Microdileptus
breviproboscis or vice versa because of the taxonomic problems explained in M. breviproboscis. Foissner
(1984) found Pseudomonilicaryon anguillula in brown, alluvial soil of a Mesobrometum in Lower Austria,
near the village of Bierbaum. Since then, it has been recorded in terrestrial habitats from all biogeographic
regions, except Antarctica and the islands in the southern oceans: in soil from various forests in Austria and
Germany (aescht & Foissner 1993, Foissner et al. 2005); in inland dunes of the Hoge Veluwe National
Park, The Netherlands (Foissner & al-rasheiD 2007); in soil from Belgium (charDez 1967, 1987);
frequent in mor humus of a beech forest from Denmark (stout 1968); mor and mull humus of beechwood
soil in the Chiltern Hills, England (stout 1963); in leaf litter from Devínska Kobyla, western Slovakia
(tirJakoVá 2005); in soil and mosses from Canada (Foissner et al. 2002); in leaf litter and soil from a
variety of localities in the vicinity of the town of Manaus, Brazil (Foissner 1997b); in the upper soil layer
(pH 3.3) from a primary rain forest in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Singapore (Foissner 2008); in bark
of Eucalyptus and in brown leaf litter with distinct signs of decomposition (pH 5.5) from Cairns, Australia
(Blatterer & Foissner 1988, Foissner 1997b); in tussock and pasture soil in New Zealand (stout 1958,
1960); and in lightly and heavily burnt soils of New Zealand (stout 1961).
There are also a few unsubstantiated limnetic records: in a eutrophic lake in England (weBB 1961) and
in the beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic Antiesen River and Gusen River in Upper Austria (Blatterer 1994,
AOÖLR 1996).

Improved diagnosis: Size about 400 × 35 μm in vivo. Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like with
distinct tail, proboscis about 37% of body length. Macronucleus moniliform, composed of an average
of 18 ellipsoidal to very narrowly ellipsoidal nodules; several globular micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of
contractile vacuoles with 1–2 pores each. Two types of extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge: type
I very narrowly ovate, 6 μm long; type II oblong, about 2 μm long. On average 39 narrowly spaced ciliary
rows, up to 10 anteriorly differentiated into a staggered, distinctly heterostichad, complex dorsal brush
with three types of bristles and monokinetidal tails extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening
419

elliptical, about 25 × 10 μm in size. Preoral kineties widely spaced, oblique, each usually composed of 3
ordinarily spaced cilia.
Type locality: Mud and soil from road puddles in the Bambatsi Guest Farm between the towns of Khorixas
and Outjo, Namibia, E15°25’ S20°10’.
Type material: Foissner et al. (2002) deposited one holotype slide (inv. no. 2002/364) and two paratype
slides (inv. nos 2002/362 and 2002/363) with protargol-impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre of
the Museum of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles.
Etymology: Apposite noun composed of the Latin adjective angustus (narrow) and the Greek noun stoma
(mouth), meaning having a “narrow-mouth”.
Description: Size highly variable, i.e., 250–650 × 25–65 μm in vivo, usually about 400 × 35 μm, as
calculated from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming about 10% preparation
shrinkage (Table 66); very flexible but not contractile. Shape very narrowly dileptid to rod-like, i.e.,
length:width ratio 7.9–17.4:1, on average 11.4:1 in protargol preparations. Length of proboscis also highly
variable, viz., 25% to 46% of body length, on average about 37%, usually curved dorsally; trunk oblong
to cylindroidal, unflattened; posterior end with distinct, up to 100 μm long tail well recognizable also
in prepared specimens (Figs 131a, b; Table 66). Nuclear apparatus extends between oral bulge opening
and base of tail. Macronucleus moniliform and tortuous, broken into two long pieces in two out of
eight specimens, composed of 8–44, on average of 18 nodules; individual nodules ellipsoidal to very
narrowly ellipsoidal, homogenously impregnated. On average 8 micronuclei attached to macronuclear
strand, 3 μm across (Figs 131a, b; Table 66). A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles beginning subapically;
possibly some also on ventral side; one to two intrakinetal excretory pores per vacuole (Figs 131a, n).
Extrusomes highly similar to those of P. japonicum, attached to broader right branch of proboscis oral
bulge, impregnate faintly to distinctly with the protargol method used (Fig. 131d): type I very narrowly
ovate, 6 μm long; type II oblong, only about 2 μm long. Cortex very flexible, slightly furrowed by ciliary
rows in SEM micrographs (Fig. 131n); cortical granulation not studied. Cytoplasm colourless, packed
with lipid droplets 1–5 μm across and some food vacuoles containing remnants of rotifers; at base of tail
a defecation vacuole. Movement not studied in detail.
Cilia narrowly spaced; arranged in an average of 39 narrowly spaced rows (Fig. 131b; Table 66). Anterior
end of ventral ciliary rows more densely ciliated and distinctly curved rightwards before abutting on
circumoral kinety (Fig. 131f). Ciliature of proboscis’ right side with the same peculiarities as in P.
japonicum (Figs 131b, d, f): (i) ciliary rows not shortened, (ii) first row right of perioral kinety with
comparatively narrowly spaced basal bodies in some specimens, but never as narrow as in perioral kinety,
and (iii) a comparatively wide, blank stripe right of oral bulge. First row right of circumoral kinety extends
as perioral kinety with narrowly spaced cilia to tip of proboscis. Left side of proboscis with comparatively
narrow blank stripe because of the rather narrow proboscis and the left side brush rows (Figs 131c, e, i–m,
t, u). Dorsal brush a long field on dorsal and left side of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad;
composed of up to ten rows with loosely to very loosely spaced kinetids. First brush row begins usually in
second third of proboscis, while last row commences subapically. All rows continue with a monokinetidal
tail, those of dorsalmost rows extend to mid-proboscis, while those of ventralmost rows reach base of
proboscis. Type III, V, and VI brush bristles (SEM observations and measurements): type III bristles of
same length (1.5–2.5 μm) or anterior bristle shorter (1.3–1.5 μm) than posterior (2.5–3.8 μm; Figs 131j–m,
o–s); type V anterior bristle strongly inflated, obovate, 1.2–1.4 μm long, posterior bristle conical, 0.6–0.8
μm long, lacking or covered by the strongly inflated anterior bristle in proximal portion of proboscis (Figs
131k, l, q–u); type VI bristles conical, 0.6–0.8 μm long, form the monokinetidal tails (Figs 131k, l, q, r, t,

two proboscides, showing the variability of the dorsal brush: the bristles are shorter and thus less conspicuous in
the right specimen. The brush is composed of several staggered rows with loosely to very loosely spaced kinetids
associated with three types of bristles (measurements from SEM micrographs): type III bristles are rod-shaped and
about 2.5–3.8 μm long; the anterior bristle of type V is strongly inflated, obovate and 1.2–1.4 μm long, while the
posterior bristle is conical and only 0.6–0.8 μm long; the type VI tail bristles are monokinetidal and about 0.7 μm
long. Asterisks mark blank stripe on the left side of the proboscis, i.e., between the preoral kineties and the dorsal
brush; m – left side view of distal proboscis area, showing the preoral kineties and dorsal brush extending to the tip

Figs 131o–u: Pseudomonilicaryon angustistoma, dorsal brush in the scanning electron microscope (from Foissner
et al. 2002). All measurements from SEM micrographs. Figures (t, u) are from the specimen shown in (i). There are
three types of brush bristles, each likely with a special, as yet unknown function. The dikinetidal type III bristles are
rod-shaped and of a similar length (o, q) or the anterior bristle (o, p, arrows) is slightly to distinctly shorter than the
posterior one (1.3–1.5 μm vs. 2.5–3.8 μm). The anterior bristle of type V dikinetids is strongly inflated, obovate, and
1.2–1.4 μm long, while the posterior bristle is a minute, conical stump (q–s, arrowheads) lacking or covered by the
strongly inflated anterior bristle found only in the proximal portion of the proboscis (t, u). The type VI bristles are
monokinetidal, conical, 0.6–0.8 μm long, and form the tail of the brush rows (q, r, t, u). The asterisks mark the blank
stripe between preoral kineties and dorsal brush. The arrow in (u) denotes a preoral kinety composed of five cilia. B

u).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, projects ordinarily, elliptical to narrowly elliptical
and about 25–30 μm long in SEM (Figs 131b, f, g, h), on average 25 × 10 μm in size after protargol
impregnation (Table 66). Pharyngeal basket obconical, inconspicuous in protargol preparations because
basket rods impregnated only in distal portion (Figs 131a, f). Oral bulge distinct in SEM micrographs due
to the nice metachronal ciliary waves and the extrusome tips in broader right branch (Figs 131g, h, t).
Circumoral kinety composed of narrowly to ordinarily spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced
monokinetids around oral bulge opening (Fig. 131f). Preoral kineties comparatively widely spaced, extend
in distinct furrows, oblique and each composed of one to five, usually three ordinarily to narrowly spaced
cilia (Figs 131c, e, j–m, t, u).
Remarks: The most important difference between P. angustistoma and other species with moniliform
macronucleus is the elliptical oral bulge opening, a special feature resembling, for instance, Dimacrocaryon
amphileptoides and, especially, Pelagodileptus trachelioides. Indeed, this pelagic species has remarkable
similarities (size, macronuclear pattern) with Pseudomonilicaryon angustistoma, but is distinctly
stouter (4.3:1 vs. 11.4:1), has 120–200 ciliary rows (vs. 39), and is packed with symbiotic green algae
(zoochlorellae). Pseudomonilicaryon angustistoma is also similar to P. japonicum, except for the more
slender body (length:width ratio 11.4:1 vs. 5.7:1), the higher number of macronuclear nodules (28 vs.18),
and the more complex dorsal brush (three vs. two types of bristles). However, there are some remarkable
similarities, viz., the blank stripe right of the oral bulge and the densely ciliated row right of the perioral
kinety. Possibly, P. angustistoma and P. japonicum form a subgroup within the genus.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found only at type locality. The slender body indicates that P.
angustistoma is a terrestrial species.

Improved diagnosis (type population): Size about 400 × 75 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly to very narrowly
dileptid with acute posterior third, proboscis 35% of body length. Macronucleus moniliform and tortuous,
composed of an average of 28 globular to ellipsoidal nodules; several lenticular micronuclei. A dorsal
and a ventral stripe of contractile vacuoles with 1–2 pores each. Two shape and size types of extrusomes
attached to proboscis oral bulge: type I very narrowly ovate, 6 μm long; type II oblong, about 2 μm long.
On average 39 ciliary rows, about 18 anteriorly differentiated into a staggered, distinctly heterostichad
dorsal brush with monokinetidal tails extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening about 20 μm
across. Preoral kineties ordinarily spaced, oblique, each composed of 3 narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Tree and soil mosses from the surroundings of the “Spring of Wisdom” in Kyoto, Japan,
E135°45’ N35°00’.
Type material: Foissner et al. (2002) deposited one holotype slide (inv. no. 2002/682) and four paratype
slides (inv. nos 2002/683–686) with protargol-impregnated specimens in the Biology Centre of the Museum
of Upper Austria, Linz (LI). Relevant specimens are marked by black ink circles on the coverslip.
Etymology: The Latin adjective japonicus refers to the country in which the species was discovered.
Description of Japanese population: Size 260–580 × 50–105 μm in vivo, usually about 400 × 75 μm, as

calculated from some in vivo measurements and the morphometric data, assuming about 10% preparation
shrinkage (Table 66); very flexible but not contractile. Shape narrowly to very narrowly dileptid, i.e.,
length:width ratio 3.8–8.4:1, on average 5.7:1 in protargol preparations. Length of proboscis highly
variable, viz., 22% to 55% of body length, on average about 35%, usually conspicuously curved dorsally;
trunk slenderly to bluntly fusiform, widest in mid-portion; posterior end acute to narrowly rounded both in
vivo and after various preparations, never tail-like (Figs 132b, e, f, 133i–k; Table 66). Nuclear apparatus
usually in anterior three quarters of trunk. Macronucleus moniliform and tortuous, composed of an average
of 28 nodules easily recognizable even in vivo at low magnification (Fig. 133a); individual nodules
usually ellipsoidal; nucleoli small and globular. On average 20 micronuclei adjacent to macronuclear
strand, conspicuous because lenticular in vivo, while ellipsoidal, ovoidal or globular in preparations, the
latter possibly when viewed transversely (Figs 132d, f, 133a, c; Table 66). Contractile vacuoles numerous
and conspicuous in dorsal and right side of proboscis and trunk, forming a broad stripe, while sparse and
thus easily overlooked in ventral and left side of trunk; usually one, rarely two intrakinetal excretory
pores per vacuole (Figs 132e–h, 133a–c, i–n, r). Two shape and size types of extrusomes attached to
proboscis oral bulge: type I very narrowly ovate, 6 × 0.8 μm in size; type II oblong, about 2 × 0.3 μm in
size; when exploded both of typical toxicyst structure, that is, with a refractive (toxin?) granule at top of
tube emerging from the empty capsule, type I extends to 16 μm, type II to 6 μm; developing extrusomes
scattered in cytoplasm and impregnating with protargol (Figs 132c, l–o, 133a, c–h). Cortex very flexible,
slightly furrowed by ciliary rows in SEM micrographs, contains a layer of refractive, comparatively large
(1 × 0.5 μm) granules, forming about seven oblique rows between adjacent kineties (Figs 132a, j, 133a–c,
n). Cytoplasm colourless, packed with many lipid droplets 1–5 μm across, some 15 μm long pharyngeal
baskets from ciliate prey (or spines for the resting cyst?), and up to seven vacuoles with remnants of
rotifers, the preferred food of this ciliate; in rear end sometimes a defecation vacuole. Movement without
peculiarities.
Cilia about 10 μm long in vivo, narrowly spaced; in protargol preparations as typical for dileptids, i.e.,
with thick, deeply impregnated distal half (Fig. 132i), except for dorsal bristles; arranged in about 40
longitudinal, narrowly spaced rows (Figs 132f, 133i–k, n; Table 66). Anterior end of ventral ciliary rows
more densely ciliated and indistinctly curved rightwards abutting on circumoral kinety (Figs 132f, g,
133o, p). Ciliature of proboscis’ right side with several remarkable specializations (Figs 132f, g, 133m,
o, r): (i) rows not shortened or only near anterior end of oral bulge, (ii) first row right of perioral kinety
with comparatively narrowly spaced basal bodies in half of specimens, but never as narrow as in perioral
kinety, and (iii) a comparatively wide, blank stripe right of oral bulge. First row right of circumoral
kinety extends as perioral kinety with narrowly spaced cilia to tip of proboscis (Figs 132f, g, 133j, m,
o, r). Left side of proboscis with conspicuously broad, blank stripe because left side ciliary rows end at
level of oral bulge opening or slightly above (Figs 132h, 133i, k, l, q, s, t). Dorsal brush on dorsal and left
side of proboscis; staggered; distinctly heterostichad; composed of about 18 rows (possibly slightly over-
estimated, according to the SEM micrographs). Brush dikinetids loosely to ordinarily spaced, associated
with type II bristles both being 3–4 μm long in vivo (1.5–1.7 μm in SEM preparations). All rows continue
with a monokinetidal tail extending to second third of body with type VI bristles 1.5–2 μm long in vivo
(0.8–1.2 μm in SEM preparations); tails of dorsalmost rows usually extend only to mid-proboscis (Figs
132h, 133i, k, l, q, s, t).
Oral bulge opening usually at beginning of second body third, projects ordinarily, roundish both in vivo
and in preparations (Figs 132f, g, k, 133j, o, p), except for a single SEM specimen with an elliptical oral
bulge opening and thus possibly belonging to another species. Pharyngeal basket obconical, distinct both
in vivo and after protargol impregnation, without specific features (Figs 132e–g, k). Circumoral kinety
composed of narrowly spaced dikinetids in proboscis and narrowly spaced monokinetids around oral

Figs 133q–t: Pseudomonilicaryon japonicum in the SEM (from Foissner et al. 2002). q, s, t – dorsal (q) and lateral

ordinarily spaced dikinetids. In the anterior portion of a brush row are dikinetidal type II bristles, while in the
posterior portion are monokinetidal type VI bristles. Each preoral kinety is composed of three cilia. Asterisks mark
broad blank stripe on the left side of the proboscis; r – right side view of proboscis’ base. Pseudomonilicaryon
japonicum is unique in having contractile vacuoles and excretory pores (arrowheads) not only on the dorsal, but also
in the right side of the proboscis. Possibly, the right side pores belong to the ventral vacuole stripe. The first ciliary
row (arrow) right of the perioral kinety is ordinarily ciliated in about half of specimens, while densely in the other
half (m, o). This is another rare feature, as yet observed only in P. angustistoma and P. fraterculum. B – dorsal brush,

bulge opening. Preoral kineties ordinarily spaced, oblique, each composed of two to four, usually three
narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 132g, h, 133s, t).
Notes on French population: Dragesco (1966a) described a population which resembles P. japonicum
in having ventral and dorsal contractile vacuoles, a rare feature in Pseudomonilicaryon. However, this
population, which occurred in Lake Léman near the town of Thonon, France, has a much larger body
(1200 μm vs. 400 μm) and a distinct tail (Fig. 132p). Dragesco (1966a) supposed the Thonon population
to be Monilicaryon monilatum. However, this species has a shorter proboscis (1/5 vs. 1/3 of body length)
and lacks ventral vacuoles. Possibly, Dragesco’s population represents a distinct species.
Occurrence and ecology: To date found at type locality and (possibly) in rain forest moss from Venezuela,
where it has a short tail and thus resembles Pseudomonilicaryon angustistoma. These specimens fed, like
those of the type population, on rotifers, suggesting P. japonicum as a bryophilic rotifer predator.
Remarks: Pseudomonilicaryon japonicum is unique in having excretory pores not only in the dorsal side
but also in the right side of the proboscis rather close to the circumoral kinety (Figs 132f, g, 133j, m, r).
Possibly, the right side pores belong to the ventral vacuole stripe. A further rare feature, as yet known only
from P. brachyproboscis, P. aculeatum, and P. gracile oviplites, is the lenticular shape of the micronuclei
(Figs 132d, f, 133a). Likewise, the condensation of the cilia in the first kinety right of the perioral row is
rather unusual, but present in only half of specimens (Figs 132f, g, 133m, o).
Within the group of dileptids with a moniliform macronucleus, P. japonicum is most similar to P. falciforme
and P. angustistoma. In vivo, these species are best separated by the shape of the oral bulge opening
(roundish in P. falciforme and P. japonicum, distinctly elliptical in P. angustistoma) and the arrangement
of the extrusomes (ordinary in P. japonicum and P. angustistoma, while P. falciforme has, additionally,
short, knotty extrusomes in the oral bulge opening). In preparations, the structure of the dorsal brush (P.
falciforme with anterior tails, P. angustistoma with strongly inflated type V bristles in proximal brush
portion) adds further characteristics.
Pseudomonilicaryon kahli (ŠrámEk-huŠEk, 1957) nov. comb. (Figs 134a–t)
This species is possibly a junior synonym of Pseudomonilicaryon massutii because the main morphological
characteristics are so similar that they cannot be separated unambiguously. However, the habitats are
different: saline for P. massutii-like populations, limnetic or terrestrial for P. kahli-like populations.
Considering that few ciliates live in both, limnetic and saline habitats, we keep P. massutii and P. kahli
separate, assigning saline records to the former and limnetic ones to the latter.

Generic affiliation, nomenclature, and taxonomy (see also above): Jankowski (1967) did not combine
Dileptus kahli with one of his subgenera. We assign it to Pseudomonilicaryon because it has a Dileptus-
like ciliary pattern and a moniliform macronucleus (song 1994b).
kahl (1931) misidentified a Hamburg population (Alster Lake) as D. monilatus stokes, 1886, but mentioned
that it considerably differs from that of stokes (1886) in having a distinct tail (vs. acute posterior third) and
a much longer proboscis occupying 1/3–1/2 vs. 1/5 of body length. Further, kahl (1931) emphasized that
it possibly represents a new species: “Sollte stokes’ Form sich als typisch erweisen, so muß die meine als
selbständige Form neu benannt werden”. This was done by Šrámek-huŠek (1957), who observed a single
specimen matching kahl’s Dileptus from Hamburg, using, unfortunately, nom. nov. instead of spec. nov.
Later authors (VuXanoVici 1959, DingFelDer 1962, Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis 1968, song 1994b)
followed kahl’s classification, neglecting kahl’s doubts and Šrámek-huŠek (1957). We declare the figure
from kahl (1931), here reproduced as Fig. 134b and used by Šrámek-huŠek (1957) for establishing D.
kahli, as the holotype.
As concerns the populations listed, all important features match: body 400–900 μm long and cylindroidally
dileptid to rod-like with distinct tail and proboscis 1/3–1/2 of body length; macronucleus moniliform and
composed of 15–35 nodules; contractile vacuoles in a dorsal stripe. However, the Roumanian population
studied by VuXanoVici (1959) is very likely a distinct species because it has symbiotic green algae and
much smaller macronuclear nodules (3 μm vs. 15–20 μm in diameter). VuXanoVici (1959) did not describe
the arrangement and number of the macronuclear nodules, and thus the generic home of his population
remains doubtful. Unfortunately, the important description of song (1994b) possibly also contains serious
mistakes, i.e., some tabulated values do not fit the figures: (i) the Table gives a length of 340–440 μm (an
average of 393 μm), while one of his figures shows a 540 μm long specimen (here reproduced as Fig. 134f)
and another an even 630 μm long exemplar (Fig. 134k), values that match the literature data very well
when some preparation shrinkage is added; (ii) the tabulated number of ciliary rows is 22–27 (on average
23), while one of his figures (here reproduced as Fig. 134f) shows 12 kineties on one side, suggesting
about 30 rows in total; (iii) and the dorsal brush, which is said to be three-rowed (Fig. 134f), is not shown
in detail and possibly too schematized.
As obvious from the synonymy list, Pseudomonilicaryon kahli was frequently confused with Monilicaryon
monilatum which, however, is easily distinguished both in vivo and in protargol preparations by the much
shorter proboscis (1/5 vs. 1/3–1/2 of body length), the acute posterior third (vs. distinct tail), the much
higher number of ciliary rows (40–60 vs. 22–27), and the different dorsal brush (1 vs. 3 rows) and oral
(preoral kineties form a perioral-like kinety vs. distinctly separated each consisting of 3 cilia) ciliary
pattern. Another similar species is Pseudomonilicaryon thononense, which is much smaller (usually 300
μm vs. 700 μm) and possesses less ciliary rows (usually 18 vs. possibly 30).
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 700 × 40 μm in vivo. Shape cylindroidally
dileptid to rod-like with distinct tail, proboscis about 1/3 of body length. Macronucleus moniliform,
composed of 15–35 globular nodules; several globular micronuclei. A dorsal stripe of contractile vacuoles.
Possibly about 30 ciliary rows, several differentiated into a dorsal brush anteriorly. Oral bulge opening
roundish. Preoral kineties strongly oblique, each usually composed of 3 narrowly spaced cilia.

Type locality: Šrámek-huŠek (1957) discovered P. kahli in the Podolský potok stream, Janovice, Czech
Republic, E18°06’ N49°46’.
Type and voucher material: No type material is available. song (1994b) did not mention deposition of
any slides containing Chinese specimens identified as Dileptus monilatus.
Dedication: Šrámek-huŠek (1957) dedicated this species to the eminent German ciliate taxonomist,
Alfred kahl.
Description: Size usually about 700 × 40 μm in vivo; Hamburg specimens 500–900 μm long (kahl 1931),
Czech exemplar 650 μm (Šrámek-huŠek 1957), North American specimen 550 μm (conn 1905); African
cells 500–800 μm (Dragesco 1970; Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis 1986), and Chinese specimens 400–
500 μm (song 1994b, but see critic above); very flexible but not contractile. Shape distinctly fusiform,
cylindroidally dileptid to rod-like, that is, length:width ratio about 10–16:1, according to the figures
available. Proboscis one third to one half of body length, anterior fifth usually curved dorsally, highly
motile and flexible; trunk oblong and unflattened in vivo; tail usually distinct, occupies up to one third of
trunk length (Figs 134a–d, f, i, k, l, q–s). Macronucleus a moniliform, basically straight strand extending
between oral bulge opening and base of tail, composed of 15–35 globular to broadly ellipsoidal nodules
15–20 μm in diameter (Figs 134a–d, k, l, q, r, t); macronucleus surrounded by a homogenous, gelatinous
envelope in North American specimens in Feulgen preparations (Fig. 134t); many nucleoli about 1–2
μm across, well recognizable in vivo and in preparations (Figs 134o, t). Four to 20 micronuclei attached
to macronuclear nodules, 3–5 μm across in vivo, while 2–3 μm in protargol preparations (Fig. 134k);
surrounded by a distinct membrane in North American specimens (Fig. 134t). A stripe of contractile
vacuoles in dorsal side of cell: about 5–10 vacuoles in proboscis and 10–15 in trunk (Figs 134a–e, k, l,
q, r). Extrusomes not studied in vivo; very narrowly ovate and 6 × 0.5 μm in size in iron hematoxylin
stains (Fig. 134p), while rod-shaped and 7–9 μm long after protargol impregnation, sometimes showing
a typical toxicyst structure (Fig. 134j). Cytoplasm colourless, opaque in trunk because packed with lipid
droplets and food vacuoles; in trunk end sometimes a defecation vacuole (Fig. 134s). Usually moves
slowly through organic mud and zoogleal masses, probing with the proboscis; swims by rotation about
main body axis (Jones & Beers 1953).
Cilia ordinarily to narrowly spaced, arranged in at least 22–27 longitudinal rows (song 1994b; but see
critic above). Perioral kinety extends to tip of proboscis with narrowly spaced basal bodies. Left side of
proboscis with broad, blank stripe because left side ciliary rows end at level of oral bulge opening, except
for one to two kineties extending to or above proximal third of proboscis (Figs 134e, f, h). Dorsal brush on
dorsal and dorso-lateral region of proboscis, probably three-rowed (Fig. 134f; song 1994b; but see critic
above). Silverline pattern composed of very small, polygonal meshes about 0.5 μm in size (Fig. 134g).
Oral bulge opening at beginning of second body third, roundish and about 10 μm across in iron hematoxylin
stains (Fig. 134m), appears ovate when viewed obliquely (Figs 134f, h). Pharyngeal basket obconical, well
recognizable in vivo and in preparations (Figs 134b–d, f, h, k, m, n, q, r). Oral ciliary pattern dileptid, left
branch of circumoral kinety associated with many short, strongly oblique preoral kineties, each usually
composed of three narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 134f, h).
Occurrence and ecology: Pseudomonilicaryon kahli was first observed in the mud of the mesosaprobic
Aussenalster Lake in the surroundings of the town of Hamburg, Germany (kahl 1931). Later, Šrámek-
huŠek (1957) reported a single specimen from the beta-mesosaprobic Podolský potok stream, Czech
Republic. Further freshwater records: meadow rainwater puddles in the surroundings of the town of
Forchheim, Germany (DingFelDer 1962); a doubtful record (see above) from the coast of Lake Herǎstrǎu,
Bucharest, Roumania (VuXanoVici 1959); brooks and rivers in the surroundings of the town of Middletown,
Connecticut, USA (conn 1905); Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA (Jones & Beers 1953); and various

sandy benthic localities in tropical Africa (Dragesco 1970; Dragesco & Dragesco-kernéis 1986). song
(1994b) recorded P. kahli in soil from the surroundings of the town of Qingdao, China. Possibly, P. kahli
is a ubiquitous cosmopolite feeding on bacteria and medium-sized ciliates, such as Euplotes and Colpoda
(Jones & Beers 1953).

Improved diagnosis: Small- to large-sized Dileptidae with narrowly dileptid. Macronucleus moniliform.
Dorsal brush multi-rowed. Right branch of circumoral kinety accompanied by two perioral kineties,
left branch by many oblique preoral kineties. Oral bulge opening paradileptid, i.e., inverted and located
laterally, just as in numeral 6. Cyst wall radially striated.
Type species (by original designation): Amphileptus flagellatus rousselet, 1890. However, A. flagellatus
is a junior synonym of A. moniliger ehrenBerg, 1835 and a senior synonym of Dileptus elephantinus Švec,
1897 (see below). Thus, we shall propose D. elephantinus to be fixed as the type species of Paradileptus
under the plenary power of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the Latin prefix para (like) and the generic
name Dileptus. Masculine gender.
Remarks: wenrich (1929) diagnosed the genus as follows: “Body oval or conical in shape, broad and
obliquely truncated at the level of the cytostome, providing a wide peristomal field with a raised border or
rim which is prolonged anteriorly into a spirally wound proboscis; a narrow trichocyst–(toxicyst)–bearing
zone flanked on either side by a band of longer cilia, takes origin near the cytostome and traverses the
anterior edge of the rim of the peristome and the proboscis; cilia of uniform length on the remainder of
the body surface; cytostome a circular opening, closed except during ingestion; pharynx with longitudinal
fibrils, as in Dileptus; contractile vacuoles small, numerous, distributed over the body; macronucleus
beaded or in segments”. Foissner et al. (1999) added the perioral kineties, and we add the resting cyst,
which distinctly differs from the, admittedly few, dileptid cysts known (see general part), including that
of Pelagodileptus trachelioides.
Paradileptus comprises seven nominal species, of which only one, P. elephantinus, is valid. Paradileptus
is possibly closely related to Pelagodileptus, as they share two strong synapomorphies: (i) the right branch
of the circumoral kinety is accompanied by two perioral kineties and (ii) the planktonic way of life.
The two genera differ by the structure of the resting cysts and the proboscis base, which is strongly
broadened in Paradileptus, taking along the oral bulge and the bulge opening which becomes located

laterally and inverted, just as in numeral 6. This pattern evolved very likely convergently in one other
dileptid, Apotrachelius, which has, however, a lateral fossa, a single perioral kinety, and many scattered
macronuclear nodules.

Nomenclature: Paradileptus elephantinus (ŠVec, 1897) kahl, 1931 was originally described as
Amphileptus moniliger by ehrenBerg (1835), as indicated by Fig. 143m. Unfortunately, kahl (1931) and
other authors overlooked ehrenBerg’s description. In this situation, the older species epithet moniliger
does not take precedence over the younger elephantinus because both conditions of Article 23.9.1 of the
ICZN (1999) are met: (i) Amphileptus moniliger ehrenBerg, 1838 has not been used after 1899 [possibly
this species was last time mentioned by marsson 1901 as “Dileptus moniliger (ehB.)”] and (ii) the
junior synonym, Paradileptus elephantinus (ŠVec, 1897) kahl, 1931, has been used at least in 25 works
published by at least ten authors in the immediately preceding fifty years, encompassing a span of not less
than ten years (see list of synonyms). Thus, Amphileptus moniliger would become a nomen oblitum and
Paradileptus elephantinus a nomen protectum. However, the matter is complex because the type species
of the genus, P. flagellatus, is very likely an older synonym of P. elephantinus and a younger synonym
of Amphileptus moniliger. If this synonymization is anticipated, the species must be named Paradileptus
moniliger which, however, is a forgotten name. Thus, we shall make a bid to the International Commission
of Zoological Nomenclature to protect P. elephantinus, i.e., the name which was widely used since kahl
(1931) and which we use in the present monograph.
Synonymy and identification: This species is rather variable and more importantly, very fragile.
Specifically, the trunk shape, the proboscis, and the tail are delicate and thus usually recognizable mainly
in freshly collected material. The tail disappears rapidly and the cell becomes bulky, looking like P.
elephantinus, when the environment becomes unfavourable. Therefore, Foissner et al. (1999) supposed
synonymy of most or all species listed above. They differ from each other and from P. elephantinus in
body size and/or shape and/or number of macronuclear nodules. The last character has been used by
several authors, but is doubtful because it has a high intrapopulation variability (8–14, mean 11.9 nodules
in Australian population; 7–20 nodules in the 1994 Salzburg population; 5–9, mean 6.9 nodules in the
1997 Salzburg population, only 1[!] nodule in half of specimens in a collection made one month later),
indicating that the differences between populations must not be over-interpreted. Thus, all these taxa are
inseparable, including the binucleate P. flagellatus (rousselet, 1890) wenrich, 1929, at least at the present
state of knowledge; at best, some can be considered as subspecies or ecoforms. Basically, the populations
need careful reinvestigation as concerns the extrusomes (in vivo!) and the number of ciliary rows.
Paradileptus elephantinus is easy to identify because it is very conspicuous due to the helical shape
and proboscis, the dish-like widened proboscis base, and the obconical trunk. However, these features
are frequently partially or completely lost in insufficiently preserved (fixed) cells, leaving behind an
ellipsoidal mass (Fig. 137g). In this case, look for the characteristic, moniliform macronucleus, but be
careful not to confuse it with Linostomella (a heterotrich previously named Condylostoma). There is only
one further euplanktonic dileptid with moniliform macronucleus, Pelagodileptus trachelioides, which
is usually distinctly larger (300–600 μm vs. 150–350 μm), has symbiotic green algae, and a narrowly
elliptical oral bulge opening (vs. roundish and just as in numeral 6).

Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 300 × 150 μm in vivo. Shape dileptid
to narrowly dileptid with long proboscis dish-like broadened posteriorly at left side; trunk obconical with
short tail. Macronucleus moniliform, composed of about 15 globular nodules; several globular micronuclei.
Many scattered contractile vacuoles, each with 1 pore, in trunk and dorsal side of proboscis. Extrusomes
rod-shaped, possibly 4 μm long, attached to proboscis oral bulge. About 160 ciliary rows; dorsal brush
multi-rowed, staggered, with monokinetidal tails extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening about
20 μm across. Preoral kineties narrowly spaced, slightly to ordinarily oblique, each composed of about 10
narrowly spaced cilia.
Type locality: Plankton from the Počernický rybník Pond near Prague, Czech Republic, E14°49’
N50°12’.
Type material: Not available.
Etymology: Not given in original description. The Latin adjective elephantinus (elephantine) refers to the
long and motile proboscis resembling that of an elephant.
Description: All known data are put together although some synonyms are still questionable. Thus, some
data are kept separate.
Size in vivo similar in most populations, usually about 300 × 160 μm: 200–250 × 100 μm (ŠVec 1897,

Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape in vivo dileptid to narrowly dileptid, that is, length:width
ratio on average 2.8:1 (M = 2.8:1, SD = 0.6:1, SE = 0.1:1, CV = 22.5%, Min = 1.3:1, Max = 4.3:1, n =
38), according to the figures available in the literature; and on average 3.3:1 (M = 3.3:1, SD = 0.6:1, SE
= 0.2:1, CV = 17.4%, Min = 2.5:1, Max = 4.5:1, n = 13), according to our light microscopical and SEM
micrographs. Proboscis conspicuous because helically twisted and posteriorly broadened dish-like (Figs
135a–n, u, 136a–h, o, s–u, w, x, 137a–f, o–u); highly variable in length because very fragile and thus often
injured or even more or less lost; usually occupies one third to one half of body length, while distinctly
longer than trunk in some specimens of Paradileptus estensis, which thus might be a distinct species
(Figs 135u, v, 137e, f), up to 90 μm long according to ŠVec (1897). Trunk massive, slightly flattened and
obconical in fresh material, while becoming almost globular under adverse conditions (Figs 135a–n, p–v,
136a–h, o, s–u, w, x, 137a–f, o–t). Posterior end with distinct tail present only in fresh material (Figs 135d,
e, p–u, 137f, p), soon becoming acute and more or less broadly rounded (Figs 135a–c, f–j, 136a–h, s–u, w,
x, 137a–e, g, l, m, q–s); rarely bifurcated in North American cells (Fig. 136m).
Nuclear apparatus usually extends between oral bulge opening and base of tail, rarely commences in
anterior third of proboscis (Figs 135g, h). Macronucleus a moniliform, slightly to strongly sigmoidal or
tortuous strand surrounded by a gelatinous capsule in vivo (Figs 135a–i, l, n, p, q, u, 136b, d, f–h, s–u, w, x,

137e, g, h, l–n). Individual nodules usually conspicuously globular, rarely broadly ellipsoidal or ellipsoidal,
with roughened outline in haemalum stains (wenrich 1929). Number of nodules rather variable within
and between populations: 8–12 (ŠVec 1897); usually 10–15 (extremes 1–20) according to Foissner et al.
(1995, 1999); 8 (Amphileptus moniliger, ehrenBerg 1838); 8 (Paradileptus estensis, canella 1951); 2
(P. flagellatus, rousselet 1890); 4–6 (P. minutus, Dragesco 1972a); 11–14 (P. ovalis, huBer-Pestalozzi
1945); 4–8 (wenrich 1929) and 23 (canella 1951) in the synonym P.conicus; 10–23 (wenrich 1929) and
29 (wang & nie 1933) in the synonym P. robustus. Size of nodules and nucleoli not yet studied. During
cell division, the macronuclear nodules fuse to a globular mass, becoming a long, mid-constricted rod in
late dividers (Figs 135w, 136i, p); early post-dividers have an oblong macronucleus becoming elongated
and nodulated in late post-dividers (Figs 136k, y). Several globular micronuclei attached to macronuclear
strand; exact number not known.
Contractile vacuole pattern identical in all populations investigated, i.e., many vacuoles scattered
underneath cell surface of trunk and proboscis (Figs 135b–i, l, n, p, q, u, 136a–d, h, o, s–u, w, x, 137a, b).
Number of vacuoles given only for the synonym P. minutus: 10–15 (Dragesco 1972a). Excretory pores
studied only by Foissner et al. (1995, 1999), that is, invariably a single, intrakinetal pore per vacuole (Figs
137o–q, t, z).
Extrusomes in vivo short and rod-shaped, forming about three rows in proboscis oral bulge (Fig. 136n);
should be checked in further populations. After protargol impregnation, appear as slightly curved, 4 μm
long rods (Figs 137j–n, v); in other preparations tripartited into neck, bulb, and thread (Fig. 135t).
Cortex flexible, slightly furrowed by ciliary rows in SEM micrographs (Fig. 137z). Cortical granules 2–3
μm long, closely spaced and thus forming a more or less distinct fringe (Foissner et al. 1999). Cytoplasm
yellow brown at low magnification due to minute cytoplasmic inclusions and food vacuoles; without
symbiotic green algae. Swims rather rapidly rotating about main body axis with proboscis projecting
forward in a helical pattern; when disturbed, swims rapidly backwards (wenrich 1929).
Cilia about 10 μm long in vivo, ordinarily to widely spaced. Ciliary rows narrowly to ordinarily spaced,

meridionally arranged, number studied only by FryD-VersaVel et al. (1975), viz., about 200 in P.
elephantinus and 120 in the synonym P. conicus, a considerable difference indicative for distinct species.
Details of ciliary pattern available only from FryD-VersaVel et al. (1975) and Foissner et al. (1995, 1999):
(i) first two rows right of circumoral kinety extend as perioral kineties with narrowly spaced cilia to tip of
proboscis (Figs 136v, 137j, l, n, s); (ii) left side of proboscis with conspicuous blank stripe (Figs 137o, r,
t, u, w, y); (iii) dorsal brush a triangular field on dorsal and dorsolateral area of proboscis, multi-rowed,
staggered, distinctly heterostichad, with monokinetidal tails extending to base of proboscis (Figs 136v,
137o, r, t, u, w, y); (iv) brush dikinetids loosely spaced, associated with type III bristles: anterior bristle
about 1.2–1.5 μm long, posterior one stump-like and only 0.3–0.5 μm long in SEM (Figs 137w, x).
Oral bulge opening in or slightly underneath second body half; located laterally and inverted, just as in
numeral 6; about 45 μm across after protargol impregnation, while 15–25 μm in vivo and in SEM (Figs
135g, n, 137o, r, u). Pharyngeal basket obconical, composed of numerous fibres (Fig. 135o). canella
(1951) and FryD-VersaVel et al. (1975), additionally, figured fibres originating from proboscis dikinetids
and extending laterally or dorsally (Figs 135o, 136v). Structure of circumoral kinety not yet studied in
detail. Preoral kineties conspicuous because composed of about ten narrowly to ordinarily spaced cilia and
thus forming rather long, slightly to ordinarily oblique rows (Figs 136v, 137n, v, w, y).
Resting cyst (Figs 136j, l): The resting cyst of the synonym P. conicus was studied by wenrich (1929)
and huBer-Pestalozzi (1945). Their data match well, especially in size (100–120 μm and ca. 100 μm) and
the peculiar radial striation of the wall. The description by wenrich (1929) reads as follows: “Cysts were
found in watch glasses in which specimens of D. conicus obtained in San Francisco had been segregated.
They are spherical, from 100 to 120 μm in diameter, with a relatively thick wall. Figure 4 (reproduced
here as Fig. 136l) is a somewhat diagrammatic representation of one of these cysts. Others had still thicker
walls. The cyst wall, besides being thick, is rather dense and is characterized by many radiating striations.
These are believed to be derived from the rodlets of the ectosarc which have greatly expanded. It was
not possible to make out the details of the nuclear structure, so it is not known whether or not a nuclear
reorganization takes place. There was a narrow space between the cyst wall and the protoplasm”.
Notes on conjugation (Figs 136q, r, z): wenrich (1929) described it as follows: “Conjugation was
observed in some of the P. conicus collected in San Francisco, but not in those collected in Philadelphia.
As already noted, the conjugants were smaller than the average size for the species. The proboscis was
also reduced in all the conjugants observed, but this may have been due to injury during the transfer from
Golden Gate Park to Berkeley. The conjugants became attached to each other by their oral surfaces, as
indicated in the sketches. Nuclear details have not, as yet, been worked out”. wenrich’s observations
basically match those of mamaeVa (1979c).
Occurrence and ecology (mainly according to Foissner et al. 1999): Common but usually not very
abundant in the plankton of mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes, reservoirs, ponds, and large rivers. Numbers
usually below 1000 ind./l, but contribution to total heterotrophic biomass often considerable due to the
huge size. Reliably recorded from Eurasia, Africa and Australia, thus very likely cosmopolitan. Throughout
the year, that is, eurytherm but possibly preferring the warm seasons (mamaeVa 1979a). This matches data
of BeloVa (1989), who found high numbers mainly at 19–24 °C. Oligostenohaline. Omnivorous, feeds on
bacteria, heterotrophic and autotrophic flagellates (Chilomonas paramecium, Cryptomonas, Leptocinclis),
ciliates (Ophrydium versatile), and rotifers such as Polyarthra, Keratella and Synchaeta (ŠVec 1897,
wenrich 1929, Bick 1972b, FryD-VersaVel et al. 1975, mamaeVa & koPyloV 1978, mücke 1979,

freshly collected specimen, showing the helical proboscis and the cone-shaped trunk. The proboscis base is broadened to a dish-
like platform, causing the oral bulge opening to become located laterally. Arrowheads mark contractile vacuoles; e, f – total views
of P. estensis, which is possibly a distinct species because of the large size (350–800 μm) and the long, thin proboscis (but see
Fig. 135v!); g – Paradileptus elephantinus is very delicate and rounds up when fixed with osmium acid, forming the common
elephantinus habitus; h – the moniliform macronucleus is enclosed in a gelatinous capsule; i – a squashed specimen, showing
an ingested rotifer, Keratella (arrow); j, k – ciliary pattern of right side of proboscis (j) and resting and released extrusomes in
proboscis oral bulge (j, k). There are two perioral kineties side by side associated with the right branch of the circumoral kinety
(j). This is an important feature that occurs only in a specialized group of planktonic dileptids, viz., in the genera Paradileptus
and Pelagodileptus, where the increased number of densely spaced cilia might increase the efficiency of food acquisition. CK –
circumoral kinety, E – extrusomes, MA – macronucleus (nodules), PE 1, 2 – perioral kineties. Scale bars: 5 μm (k), 20 μm (j),

Locus classicus of P. elephantinus is a fishpond (Počernický rybník) in the vicinity of Prague, Czech
Republic, where ŠVec (1897) discovered it during an algal bloom in July (for a review, see Šrámek-huŠek
1952). Locus classicus of Amphileptus moniliger is a pond in the Zoological Garden in Berlin, Germany
(ehrenBerg 1835, 1838). Later it was recorded in freshwater bodies in the surroundings of the town of
Berlin, Germany (marsson 1901). The synonym Paradileptus flagellatus was found in Lake Cromwell,
Quebec, Canada (Puytorac et al. 1972). Locus classicus of both P. conicus and P. robustus is a pond at
the University of Pennsylvania, USA, where wenrich (1929) found P. conicus in mid-May, reaching a
maximum on May 20 and not seen after May 25. Paradileptus robustus was present in very small numbers
in company with a few individuals of P. conicus, which occurred also in Mattson Lake, San Francisco,
USA, from September to November and from January to March. Locus classicus of Tentaculifera mexicana
is a pond in Bosque de Chapultepec, Mexico City (sokoloFF 1931). huBer-Pestalozi (1945) discovered
Paradileptus ovalis in the spring plankton of a large lake (Zürichsee) in Switzerland. Locus classicus
of P. estensis is the moat of the castle Estense, Ferrara, northern Italy (canella 1951, Dini et al. 1995).
Dragesco (1972a) discovered P. minutus in the Kasinga channel, Uganda.

Type species (by original designation and monotypy): Dileptus trachelioides zacharias, 1894.
Etymology: Composite of the Greek noun pelagios (living in the open sea = planktonic) and the generic
name Dileptus, meaning “a Dileptus living in the plankton”. Masculine gender.
Remarks: Foissner et al. (1999) established the genus Pelagodileptus for Dileptus trachelioides, although
the oral ciliature is as in Paradileptus, because it has a slit-like oral bulge opening (vs. roundish and
inverted) and lacks the dish-like widening of the oral field at the base of the proboscis. Very likely,
Pelagodileptus and Paradileptus are closely related, as they share two strong synapomorphies, viz., two
perioral kineties and a planktonic way of life. Further, a sister relationship is supported by the moniliform
macronucleus and the contractile vacuole pattern.

Synonymy and identification: zacharias (1894) established this species in the genus Dileptus because
of the dileptid habitus. awerinzew (1908) transferred it to Amphileptus because of the slit-like oral bulge
opening. The redescription of the synonym Paradileptus caducus by FryD-VersaVel et al. (1975) and
PackroFF & wilBert (1991) confirmed zacharias’ classification. Finally, Foissner et al. (1999) established
the new genus Pelagodileptus for zacharias’ species because of the Paradileptus-like oral ciliary pattern
and the Dileptus-like habitus.
Paradileptus caducus and P. canellai are junior synonyms because they agree in habitat (plankton), size,
nuclear apparatus, and symbiotic green algae. They are, however, much more slender, indicating profound
phenotypic variation, possibly due to certain ecological factors. The number of macronuclear nodules,
used by Dragesco (1966b) for species distinction, is highly variable (see below). Foissner et al. (1999)
suggested Dileptus saaleri schwarz, 1962, another poorly described planktonic dileptid, as a further
synonym of Pelagodileptus trachelioides. The second proboscis near mid-body shows that schwarz
(1962) observed a divider. He did not mention zoochlorellae, possibly because only preserved specimens
were studied.
Within dileptids with moniliform macronucleus, P. trachelioides resembles Pseudomonilicaryon
angustistoma in having a very narrowly elliptical oral bulge opening. However, P. angustistoma occurs
in terrestrial habitats (vs. planktonic), is much more slender (11.4:1 vs. 5:1), has far fewer ciliary rows
(39 vs. 120–200), and lacks symbiotic green algae. Further, Pelagodileptus trachelioides has a similar
size and shape as Monilicaryon monilatum, which is, however, usually benthic, lacks symbiotic green
algae, and has a roundish oral bulge opening. There are two planktonic dileptids which look like a bulky
Pelagodileptus trachelioides, viz., Paradileptus elephantinus and Trachelius ovum. However, both lack
symbiotic green algae and have a roundish (vs. very narrowly elliptical) oral bulge opening. Further,
Paradileptus elephantinus has a much stouter and smaller (300 × 150 μm vs. 600 × 200 μm) body with a
large oral field, and Trachelius ovum possesses a dumbbell-shaped macronucleus.
Improved diagnosis (includes all information known): Size about 490 × 160 μm in vivo. Shape narrowly
to very narrowly dileptid with rounded or tailed posterior end, proboscis about 1/3 of body length.
Macronucleus moniliform, usually composed of about 15 globular nodules; several globular micronuclei.
Many scattered contractile vacuoles in trunk and dorsal side of proboscis. Two size-types (6 μm and 2
μm) of rod-shaped extrusomes attached to proboscis oral bulge. About 170 ciliary rows; dorsal brush
multi-rowed, staggered, with monokinetidal tails extending to base of proboscis. Oral bulge opening very
narrowly elliptical, about 75 × 15 μm in size. Preoral kineties narrowly spaced, slightly oblique, each
usually composed of 4–6 narrowly spaced cilia. With symbiotic green algae (zoochlorellae).
Type locality: Plankton from the Großen Plöner See, northern Germany, E10°24’ N54°07’.
Type and voucher material: No type material is available from zacharias’ specimens. PackroFF & wilBert
(1991) made permanent slides at Bonn University, Germany but did not mention their deposition.
Gene sequence: The partial 18S rRNA gene sequence of a Japanese population has been deposited in
GenBank (AB558117). The sequence is 1608 nucleotides long and has a GC content of 41.9%.
Etymology: Not given in original description. Composite of the generic name Trachelius and the Latin
suffix -oides (similar), obviously referring to the shape similarity with T. ovum.
Description: All known data are put together because the morphological conspecificity is beyond
reasonable doubts for most populations mentioned in the list of synonyms. Generally, Pelagodileptus
trachelioides is a very fragile ciliate, in spite of its large size, which explains the high variability of size
and shape observed by several authors and in a cultivated Japanese population (Figs 141a–c, e–u). The
curious ejection of cytoplasm described by several authors is another expression of this fragility (see
movement and behaviour).

Size highly variable but similar in most populations, usually about 360–620 × 110–200 μm: 230–270 ×
180–200 μm (zacharias 1894, kahl 1931); 230–270 × 100–300 μm (ryloV 1935); 100–600 × 100–300
μm (huBer & niPkow 1927); 600–800 μm (gaJewskaJa 1933); up to 700 × 130 μm, distorted specimens
500–610 × 230 μm (sláDeček 1964); 500–600 µm (mamaeVa 1979c); usually 220–800 × 80–300 μm,
extremes 120–1100 μm (Butkay 2004); size of proboscis 50–900 × 10–13 μm, usually 338 × 11 μm,
size of trunk 105–420 × 45–120 μm, usually 225 × 76 μm (sonntag et al. 2007). The data of sonntag et
al. (2007) are so different that conspecificity becomes questionable. Size of synonyms: Dileptus saaleri
(fixed material) 300 × 75 μm (schwarz 1962); Paradileptus caducus 500–800 μm (kahl 1935), 400–650
× 150–200 μm (FryD-VersaVel et al. 1975), 400–800 × 100–200 μm (krainer 1988), 340–700 × 80–150
μm (PackroFF & wilBert 1991); P. canellai up to 600 μm (Dragesco 1966a).
Body very flexible but not contractile. Shape of freshly collected specimens narrowly to very narrowly
dileptid (Figs 138i, l, n, o, 139i, j, n, q–u, 140a, h, j, m, n, 141a-c), drastically changes in unfavourable
environments becoming bulky, looking very much like Trachelius ovum (Figs 138a–d, h, j, m, p, 139a–d,
e, g, h, 140k, l, 141a–c), rarely becoming globular (Fig. 138u). Length:width ratio thus highly variable, on
average 4.3:1 (M = 4.5:1, SD = 1.8:1, SE = 0.4:1, CV = 41.5%, Min = 1.5:1, Max = 8:1, n = 24), according
to the figures available in the literature, while 3.2:1 in SEM cells (min = 2.5, max = 3.7, n = 8). Proboscis
occupying 25–50%, on average 37% of body length (Figs 138b, i, o, 139i, j, n, s–u, 140a, j, 141a-c), highly
motile and flexible, shortens or even disappears when conditions become adverse (Figs 138a, d, j, p, v, w,
139a–d, q, 140k, l), which was possibly misinterpreted as contractility by sláDeček (1964). Trunk oblong,
ovate, or bluntly fusiform, unflattened, usually widest in mid-portion. Posterior end with short tail, acute,
or with a spike usually present only in fresh material (Figs 138b, i, l, o, 139a, b, i, j, n, t, u, 140j, s–v), soon
becoming more or less broadly rounded (Figs 138a, c, d, h, j, m, p, u, w, 139c–h, 140a, k, l, q, r, 141a–c).
Nuclear apparatus usually extends in anterior four fifths of trunk, rarely between oral bulge opening and
base of tail. Macronucleus a moniliform, straight or sigmoidal strand surrounded by a gelatinous capsule
in German specimens (1a–d, i, l–o, w, 2j, n, s, t, 3a, j). Number of nodules rather variable within and
between populations: 9–14 (zacharias 1894, kahl 1931); 8–15, usually 8–9 (huBer & niPkow 1927);
12–18 (gaJewskaJa 1933); 7–18 (ryloV 1935); 9 (wesenBerg-lunD 1952); 15–27 (sláDeček 1963);
6–23 (krainer 1988; Table 67); usually 6–45 (Butkay 2004); 7–20, usually 15–17 (synonym Dileptus
saaleri, schwarz 1962); 11–22 (synonym Paradileptus canellai, Dragesco 1966a); 12 (kahl 1935),
6–12 (Dragesco 1966b), and 7–10 (PackroFF & wilBert 1991) in the synonym Paradileptus caducus.
Individual nodules rather stable in shape and size, viz., globular with a diameter of 20 μm (zacharias
1894), 15–20 μm (huBer & niPkow 1927, schwarz 1962), 10 μm (Dragesco 1966a), 13–26 μm (Dragesco
1966b), 10–20 µm, usually about 15 µm (krainer 1988; Table 67), and 12–24 μm (Butkay 2004). In
African cells, nodules with a central nucleolus and connected by short bridges recognizable in Feulgen
stains (Figs 139m, o); several nucleoli per nodule according to the figures of krainer (1988) and Butkay
(2004). Usually many globular micronuclei attached to macronuclear strand but outside of capsule, about
3 μm across in vivo (Dragesco 1966a) and 2.8 μm after protargol impregnation (krainer 1988; Table
67). Number of micronuclei: 6–25 in African cells (Dragesco 1966a) and 6–21 in Austrian specimens
(krainer 1988; Table 67). schwarz (1962) observed globular and dumbbell-shaped micronuclei possibly
undergoing division.
Many contractile vacuoles scattered underneath cell surface of trunk and proboscis’ dorsal side (Figs
139j, n, t, 140p). Individual vacuoles about 6 μm across (Butkay 2004). Vacuoles difficult to recognize
due to the strongly vacuolated cytoplasm, and thus very likely overlooked by zacharias (1894), huBer &
niPkow (1922), gaJewskaJa (1933), and krainer (1988). A single intrakinetal excretory pore per vacuole
in Japanese specimens (Fig. 141q).

Extrusomes studded in broad right branch of proboscis oral bulge and scattered throughout cytoplasm.
Quite similar in Austrian, Swiss, Japanese, and type population, where the small type has been possibly
overlooked: type I in vivo 6–10 μm long and rod-shaped slightly narrowing anteriorly, acicular after
protargol impregnation (Figs 138f, 140b, e, 141e); type II oblong and only 2 μm long (Figs 140e, 141d).
ryloV (1935), additionally, figured rod-shaped extrusomes attached to the somatic cortex (Fig. 138p).
Cortex flexible, rather thick (krainer 1988), and slightly furrowed by ciliary rows in SEM micrographs
(Fig. 141q). Cortical granulation not yet studied in vivo; in SEM dense, individual granules oblong, about
0.8 × 0.3 µm in size (Fig. 141u). Silverline pattern narrowly meshed, meshes polygonal and 0.3–0.9 μm in
size, not yet studied in detail (Fig. 140c). Cytoplasm very viscous and strongly vacuolated, thus appearing
spumous (Figs 138a–e, 139j, n, t, 140a, j, p). Butkay (2004) observed how the spumous condition
originates (Fig. 140o): “At a certain place of the body, small blisters accumulate from all directions. After
a short while, they flow together abruptly, forming a “giant vacuole”. This event occurs over and over
again, causing the spumous appearance of the plasm”. Cells green due to innumerable symbiotic algae
2–4 μm in diameter, accumulated in posterior third of trunk and in plasm strands separating vacuoles (Figs
138a–d, h, i, l, m, o, p, 139n, t, 140a, j, p; Table 67). huBer & niPkow (1927) and krainer (1988) observed
specimens without zoochlorellae.
Cilia ordinarily spaced; in SEM preparations about 20 μm long (Figs 141a-c, q), after protargol impregnation
with thick, strongly impregnated distal half. Ciliary rows narrowly to ordinarily spaced, meridionally
arranged (Figs 141a-c), number studied only in two populations, viz, about 200 in French specimens
(FryD-VersaVel et al. 1975) and 120–160 in Austrian cells (krainer 1988). Details of ciliary pattern
described by FryD-VersaVel et al. (1975), krainer (1988), and PackroFF & wilBert (1991): (i) first two
rows right of circumoral kinety extend as perioral kineties with narrowly spaced cilia to tip of proboscis;
(ii) left side of proboscis with comparatively narrow blank stripe; (iii) dorsal brush a triangular field on
dorsal and dorsolateral area of proboscis, multi-rowed, staggered, with monokinetidal tails extending to
base of proboscis; (iv) brush dikinetids loosely spaced, associated with type II bristles: anterior bristle
1.7–2.4 μm long, posterior a 0.5–0.7 µm long stump in SEM micrographs (Figs 139v, w, 140d, 141c, j, n,
r–u).
Oral bulge opening in second body third, flat, does not project; very narrowly elliptical, i.e., about 75
× 15 μm in size after protargol impregnation and in SEM micrographs (Figs 138a, c, h, i, 139j, k, n, p,
v, w, 140a, d, 141a, c, g, h, p; Table 67). Pharyngeal basket obconical, composed of innumerable fibres
(Figs 139l, p, v, w, 140a, d). krainer (1988), additionally, observed long fibres originating from the oral
dikinetids of the proboscis and extending laterally or dorsally to form a loose funnel (Fig. 140d). Oral
bulge delineated by metachronal ciliary waves, dotted by extrusome tips, and transversely striated by
fibre bundles in SEM (Figs 141j, m–o). Structure of circumoral kinety not yet studied in detail, composed
of narrowly spaced kinetosomes throughout in protargol preparations (Figs 139v, w), but dense ciliature
recognizable only along proboscis oral bulge in SEM, indicating that the basal bodies around oral bulge
opening are barren (Figs 141i–p). Preoral kineties narrowly spaced, oblique, and each composed of four to
six narrowly spaced cilia (Figs 139v, w, 141j, l); wrongly oriented in krainer’s figure (Fig. 140d).
Movement and behaviour: Swims slowly to moderately fast by rotation about main body axis with
proboscis projecting forward (krainer 1988) or performing circular and dangling movements (Foissner et
al. 1999). Butkay (2004) observed two specimens swimming side by side for a while (Fig. 140w1). Later
on, one specimen slowly sank (Fig. 140w2) and the tail of the anterior specimen entered its oral bulge
opening (Fig. 140w3). He could not decide whether this was a pre-conjugation courtship, cannibalism,
or the beginning of cell fusion. When heavily disturbed, cells round up and discard the proboscis; often,
autolysis follows (PackroFF & wilBert 1991).

sláDeček (1964), krainer (1988), and
Butkay (2004) observed that Pelagodileptus
trachelioides ejects cytoplasm from the oral
bulge opening (Figs 139f, 140x). Butkay
(2004) noted that the ejected material is
hyaline, 80–100 μm long, swims in the
medium, and dissolves after a while. krainer
(1988) observed that such material formed
an adhesive disc attaching the cell to the
microscope slide. Later, the disc was resorbed
and the cell detached and swam away.
Resting cyst: Resting cysts were studied
by zacharias (1894) and huBer & niPkow
(1927). However, their data disagree in
important features: (i) size (160–180 μm
vs. 120–160 μm); (ii) absence/presence of
a mucous layer, and (iii) the macronuclear
nodules (fused vs. not fused). In our opinion,
zacharias (1894) misinterpreted a dying,
globularly inflated specimen as a resting cyst
because he did not observe a cyst wall (Fig.
138g). Globular degradation is frequent in
dying ciliates in our experience. According to
huBer & niPkow (1927), the cysts are 120–
160 μm across in vivo, dark green, and have an
inconspicuous convexity (escape apparatus?).
The wall is covered by a thick, hyaline,
colourless mucous layer. The cytoplasm is
packed with macronuclear nodules, bright
globules, and symbiotic green algae (Fig.
138k). During spring circulation, resting cysts
are transported from the sediment to the water
column.
Notes on division: Binary fission was studied
by zacharias (1894), huBer & niPkow
(1927), and Butkay (2004). It appears quite
similar to that of Dileptus (see general part).
The data can be summarized as follows
(Figs 138e, q–t, 140f, g, y): (i) cell division
occurs in active (non-encysted) condition at
full moon in nature and during night in the
laboratory; (ii) the division furrow is oblique,
i.e., makes an angle of 40° with the transverse

mid-dividers as a bud in the opisthe’s dorsal area and grows post-divisionally; (iv) the macronuclear
nodules do not fuse, that is, the moniliform strand divides into two pieces (zacharias 1894; unlikely in our
opinion); and (v) some symbiotic green algae migrate from the opisthe’s posterior region to the proter’s
posterior region.
Occurrence and ecology: Euplanktonic throughout the year with a spring peak in lakes, reservoirs, ponds
and large rivers. Reliably recorded from the Holarctis only (see below). Eurytherm, but data from Austrian
and German ponds (krainer 1988, Butkay 2004) as well as Butkay’s experiments suggest a preference
for cold water (Figs 142a–e). This matches the old data from FinDenegg (1943; 6.6–14.6 °C in Carinthian
lakes) and huBer & niPkow (1927), who found highest numbers at 8–15 °C. However, gaJewskaJa (1933)
observed Pelagodileptus trachelioides at 0–22.2 °C, pH 7.2–7.9, 6.4–13.5 mg/l O , and 0–3.3 mg/l CO .
2 2
Likewise, schwarz (1962) observed a peak in summer (see below). Oligo-euryhaline. Mixotrophic, that is,
can sustain periods of low food supply by using its symbiotic green algae, which are, however, sometimes
lacking (huBer & niPkow 1927, krainer 1988). In a nutrient enrichment experiment, P. trachelioides
occurred only during the initial period (liePa 1984). Feeds on Oscillatoria rubescens, O. limosa,
dinoflagellates, Pandorina morum, copepods, and planktonic rotifers, such as Asplanchna priodonta,
Keratella aculeata, K. cochlearis, Polyarthra sp. and Synchaeta sp. (huBer & niPkow 1927, schwarz
1962, FryD-VersaVel et al. 1975, PackroFF & wilBert 1991, Butkay 2004). Biomass of 106 specimens
about 4500 mg, when an average trunk size of 400 × 150 μm is assumed (Foissner et al. 1999).
Locus classicus of Pelagodileptus trachelioides is a large lake (Großer Plöner See) in northern Germany
(zacharias 1894a, b, 1900). The maximum abundance was 20 ind./cm2 during May (zacharias 1896).
Later, zacharias (1900, 1902) found P. trachelioides in many other lakes near Plön. Locus classicus of
the synonym Paradileptus caducus is very slowly running water (Alster) in Hamburg, northern Germany,
where kahl (1935) observed a dozen specimens. The locus classicus of Dileptus saaleri is also in northern
Germany, where schwarz (1962) discovered it in brackish lakes (2.4–4.9‰ salt) near the Baltic Sea
with a peak (311 ind./l) during summer. Locus classicus of Paradileptus canellai is Lake Geneva, where
Dragesco (1966a) found numerous specimens in August.

without illustration); freshwater near Paris, France (Dragesco 1966b); pond in France during October
and January (FryD-VersaVel et al. 1975); Danish lakes (wesenBerg-lunD 1952); autumn and winter
plankton of the Von-Campe Lake in the vicinity of the town of Hannover, Germany (Butkay 2004); eu- to
polytrophic lake in Germany during winter and spring (PackroFF & wilBert 1991); very rare in a small
lake (Grabensee) near Salzburg (Foissner et al. 1999); up to 52 ind./l (1 m, early March) and 76 ind./l
(3 m, early June) in groundwater ponds of Styria, Austria, disappearing during summer (krainer 1988);
very abundant in a drinking water reservoir in Bohemia during late May (sláDeček 1964); summer and
winter plankton of Lake Baikal but also very abundant from winter to spring and from summer to autumn
(gaJewskaJa 1933, see this paper for old Russian records; eggert 1968; kaPlin 1969); in plankton from
Lake Biwa, Japan (Figs 141a-c, f-u; Vďačný et al. 2011b).
Records not substantiated by illustrations (most likely correct because the species is very distinct): lakes
in Finland (JärneFelt 1936a, b); Swedish lakes (PeJler 1964); in a eutrophic lake of Estonia (kisanD
et al. 1998; as Paradileptus caducus); Lielupe River and lakes in Latvia (liePa 1973, 1984a, b); water
supply ponds in the surroundings of the town of Freiburg, Germany (höhne 1963); occasionally abundant
in an oligotrophic lake (Erdfallsee) in Germany (ehlers 1965); slightly eutrophic drinking water
reservoir (Saidenbach-Talsperre) in Germany, peaking during May (BeuscholD 1961); mesotrophic lake
(Pfäffikersee) in Switzerland mainly during spring and autumn (messikommer 1952, 1954); lakes in
Carinthia, Austria, mainly during May (FinDenegg 1943, 1953); in the seston of the reservoirs Klíčava and
Vrané fed by the River Vltava, Czech Republic (sláDeček 1962); Danube River in Hungary (Bereczky
1977a, Bereczky & nosek 1995); brackish lake in the former Yugoslavia (PetkoVić & PetkoVić 1978);
Moldavian and Azerbaijanian reservoirs (chorik 1968, alekPeroV 1984); up to 60 ind./l at 0–20 °C
in various mesosaprobic reservoirs in the former USSR (mamaeVa 1974, 1976a, b, 1979c; zhukoV &
mamaeVa 1978); Volga River, Russia (mamaeVa 1979a, b); diverse sites in the former USSR, including the
cooler basin of a power station (timoFeeVa 1989, aVerintzeVa 1899, arslanoVa 1980); Onega and Ladoga
lakes, Russia (smirnoVa 1987, kustoVlyankina 1990); reservoir near Moscow, Russia, subdominant
during summer (BeloVa 1994); up to 235 ind./l (surface) and 2 ind./l (92 m) in Cayuga Lake, New York,
USA, during late June (hunt & chein 1983); freshwaters in Thailand (charuBhun & charuBhun 2000;
as P. caducus).
Saprobic classification: kolkwitz & marsson (1909) classified Pelagodileptus trachelioides as an
oligosaprobic indicator. Later, kolkwitz (1950) emphasized that it occurs also in beta-mesosaprobic
habitats. sláDeček (1964) and Foissner (1988a) classified it as oligosaprobic: o = 7, b = 3, I = 4, SI =
1.3.
Insufficiently Described and Doubtful Dileptids
Altogether there are 78 insufficiently described or doubtful dileptids, i.e., very likely non-dileptid ciliates
originally or subsequently assigned to dileptids. More than half of these problematic species were
described by Abbé E. Dumas, a French amateur protistologist who studied the protist fauna of the French
Massif Central. He published the results in three volumes (Dumas 1929, 1930, 1937), which contain
the description of 550 new species, including 45 nominal species of Dileptus. Unfortunately, the studies
of Dumas were forgotten, though some of his new species appear well described. However, most are
insufficiently described, hardly providing sufficient details for recognition (Foissner 1995b). This applies
also for his dileptids, many of which are indeterminable or belong to other ciliate groups, especially to the
pleurostomatid haptorians.

In the first chapter, we treat the insufficiently described and doubtful dileptids established by various
authors but, especially, by Fromentel (1874–1876). In the second chapter, we discuss the dileptids
described by Dumas (1929–1937). All taxa are arranged alphabetically and supplied with original figures
(if available) and brief comments.
From Various Authors
Amphileptus anser – Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 286 (Figs 143c1, c2). Based on Vibrio anser
mueller, 1773; Amphileptus anser sensu ehrenBerg, 1838; and Dileptus anser sensu DuJarDin, 1841.
Mentioned also by Dumas (1929). However, Fromentel’s and Dumas’ species have a proboscis occupying
only 1/3 (vs. 1/2) of body length, and thus conspecificity with mueller ’s and ehrenBerg’s species is not
likely. Possibly, it is a poorly observed Dileptus margaritifer.
Amphileptus longicollis ehrenBerg, 1831, Abh. dt. Akad. Wiss. Berl. year 1831: 115; without figure. Also
in ehrenBerg (1838, Infusionsthierchen: 357) (Figs 143n–p). Mentioned in the revisions of claParèDe
& lachmann (1859, Mém. Inst. natn. génev. 6: 355) and of kent (1881, Manual infusoria II: 526). Not
cited in the revisions of kahl (1930–1935) and Dragesco (1963). schewiakoFF (1896) synonymized A.
longicollis with A. anser (now Pseudomonilicaryon anser). Certainly, the figures show the proboscis area
of a regenerating Dileptus specimen. Thus, the species is indeterminable.
Amphileptus massiliensis (nov. sp.) gourret & roeser, 1886, Archs Zool. exp. gén. 4: 471 (Figs 143a1,
a2). kahl (1931, Tierwelt Dtl. 21: 208) transferred it to Dileptus (Fig. 143b). Mentioned also in the
revision of Dragesco (1963, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 125). This species is so poorly described that it is
best considered as indeterminable.
Amphileptus moniliger ehrenBerg, 1835, Abh. dt. Akad. Wiss. Berl. year 1835: 165; without figure. Also
in ehrenBerg (1838, Infusionsthierchen: 356) (Fig. 143m). See Paradileptus elephantinus.
Amphileptus moniliger – Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 287 (Fig. 143r). schewiakoFF (1896)
synonymized it with Amphileptus anser (now Pseudomonilicaryon anser). Not cited in the revisions of kahl
(1930–1935) and Dragesco (1963). This is an indeterminable, early mid-divider of a pseudomonilicaryonid
dileptid. Fromentel’s species is obviously not conspecific with A. moniliger ehrenBerg, 1835 (see above)
because the latter has a much stouter body (length:width ratio 2.5:1 vs. 8.5:1) and a shorter proboscis (1/4
vs. 1/3 of body length). See also Paradileptus elephantinus.
Ctenoctophrys chattoni n. g., n. sp. weill, 1946, C. R. hebd. Séanc. Acad. Sci., Paris 222: 683 (Figs 145a,
b). Listed as incertae sedis within the family Tracheliidae by corliss (1979, Ciliated protozoa: 216) and
by lynn (2008, Ciliated protozoa: 371). Not cited in the catalogue of generic names of ciliates (aescht
2001). corliss (1979) classified Ctenoctophrys in the family Tracheliidae because of the many tentacles
which are, however, cilia forming a velum resembling that of trichodinids. Not a dileptid, and very likely
not even a ciliate. It is rather frequently cited by palaeontologists as a striking example of convergence
between ciliates and ctenophores (e.g., conway-morris 1998, 2003). Possibly, neither corliss (1979) nor
lynn (2008) consulted the original description because the cilia can hardly be interpreted as tentacles or
proboscides. In our opinion, this marine organism, which has a size of 45 × 65 μm, is a cnidarian larva.
Dileptus anas – Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 291 (Fig. 145h). Based on Trichoda anas mueller,
1773. Mentioned also by Dumas (1929, Les Microzoaires: 112; without figure). Not cited in the revision
of kahl (1930–1935). Not a dileptid.
Dileptus calceolus Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 291 (Fig. 145c). Mentioned also by Dumas
(1929, Les Microzoaires: 113) (Fig. 147k) and escomel (1929, Faune de Arequipa: 27; without figure).

Obviously, Fromentel’s species is a Blepharisma. Very likely, Dumas’ species is not conspecific with that
of Fromentel (1876) and its identity remains obscure. Not cited in the revision of kahl (1930–1935).

1932 as given by alekPeroV (2005). Certainly, alekPeroV’s species is not D. falciformis because of the
much higher number of ciliary rows (70–75 vs. 30–48), the Pseudomonilicaryon japonicum-like (vs.
P. falciforme-like) right side ciliary pattern of the proboscis, and the limnetic (vs. terrestrial) habitat.
Length 180–220 μm in vivo, 170–200 μm after silver nitrate impregnation, only 120 μm according to
the figure (Fig. 143y). Narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of about 3.2:1. Proboscis about one
third of body length, distinctly set off from bluntly fusiform trunk; posterior end tail-like. Macronucleus
moniliform, composed of 9–15 nodules; 3–5 globular micronuclei. A single contractile vacuole, very
likely a misidentified defecation vacuole at base of posterior narrowing. Cytoplasm hyaline. About 70–75
narrowly spaced ciliary rows; right side ciliary rows unshortened, leaving a broad blank stripe right of
oral bulge. Oral bulge opening roundish; oral basket conical, composed of 35–40 rods. alekPeroV (2005)
found this species in the plankton and benthos of lakes in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan. Possibly, this is an
opisthe post-divider of a member of the P. japonicum group; indeterminable with the data provided.
Dileptus fasciola – Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 290 (Fig. 143d). Based on Vibrio anas
mueller, 1786 and Amphileptus fasciola ehrenBerg, 1838, which is now Litonotus fasciola (ehrenBerg,
1838) wrześniowski, 1870 [see schewiakoFF (1889, 1896) and kahl (1931)]. Mentioned also by Dumas
(1929, Les Microzoaires: 110) (Fig. 147b).
Dileptus folium DuJarDin, 1841, Zoophytes: 409 (Figs 143e, f). Mentioned also by Fromentel (1876,
Études Microzoaires: 291) (Figs 143g, h) and Dumas (1929, Les Microzoaires: 121) (Fig. 147c). Fromentel
(1875) fixed it as type species of Dileptus. wrześniowski (1870) assigned D. folium to the genus Litonotus.
kahl (1931) synonymized L. folium with L. cygnus (mueller, 1773); we agree.
Dileptus gallina – Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 290 (Fig. 145d). Based on Trichoda gallina
mueller, 1786, which is now Uroleptus gallina (mueller, 1786) Foissner et al., 1991. Mentioned also by
Dumas (1930, Les Microzoaires: 86) (Fig. 148g). Neither Fromentel’s nor Dumas’ species is conspecific
with U. gallina, and their identity remains obscure (possibly a Loxophyllum helus).
Dileptus gigas claParèDe & lachmann, 1859 – lokot’ (1987, Èkologiâ resničnyh prostejših: 35) (Fig.
144c). Certainly, lokot’s species is not D. gigas (now Monomacrocaryon gigas) because of the untwisted
body and the much longer proboscis (40% vs. 20% of body length). The species is referred as D. anser in
the figure legend. However, D. anser has a moniliform macronucleus (vs. single oblong macronucleus) and
a longer proboscis (55% vs. 40% of body length). Length 1000–1500 μm in vivo, only 650 μm according
to the figure (Fig. 144c). Narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of about 5.4:1. Proboscis about

plankton of lakes in the Central Baikal region. Indeterminable with the data provided.
Dileptus lacrimula Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 292 (Figs 145e–g). Not cited in the revision of
kahl (1930–1935). Not a dileptid, possibly a contracted Lacrymaria. Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus meleagris Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 289 (Figs 143i–l). Mentioned also by Dumas
(1930, Les Microzoaires: 85) (Fig. 148e). A synonym of Loxophyllum meleagris (mueller, 1773)
DuJarDin, 1841.
Dileptus musculus – Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 292 (Fig. 145n). Based on Uroleptus musculus
sensu ehrenBerg, 1838, which is a junior synonym of U. gallina (mueller, 1786) Foissner et al., 1991.
Mentioned also by Dumas (1930, Les Microzoaires: 87) (Fig. 148o). Neither Fromentel’s nor Dumas’
species is conspecific with U. gallina, and their identity remains obscure.
Dileptus piscis – Fromentel (1876, Études Microzoaires: 290) (Fig. 145i). Based on Trichoda piscis
mueller, 1773, which is now Uroleptus piscis (mueller, 1773) ehrenBerg, 1831. Mentioned also by
Dumas (1929, Les Microzoaires: 119) (Fig. 147u). Neither Fromentel’s nor Dumas’ species is conspecific
with U. piscis, but both are very likely pleurostomatid haptorians.
Dileptus proboscideus n. sp. lePşi, 1957, Buletin şti. Acad. Repub. pop. rom. 9: 232 (Fig. 143v). Reviewed
in Dragesco (1963, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 124) (Fig. 143w). Length 105 μm in vivo; not contractile.
Narrowly ovoidal with a length:width ratio of about 3.5:1. Proboscis about one half of body length, flexible
and motile; trunk oblong and broadly rounded posteriorly. Cytoplasm opaque due to many granules. Oral
bulge opening roundish and small. lePşi (1957a) found this species in a peatbog from the East Carpathian
Mts. (900 m a. s. l.), Roumania. In our opinion, this organism is indeterminable.

dileptid with a length:width ratio of about 6:1. Proboscis about one fifth of body length, comparatively
massive, slightly curved dorsally; trunk oblong to bluntly fusiform, with three helical crests; posterior
region dorsoventrally flattened, not tail-like. Macronucleus oblong, but gelei (1954) could not determine
whether sausage-like or composed of nodules in a series. Several contractile vacuoles, their pattern not
studied in detail. Cytoplasm opaque due to many food vacuoles, containing euglenid flagellates and
diatoms. Ciliary rows extend meridionally, i.e., do not follow the helical body organization; number not
studied, but gelei (1954) figured eight rows on ventral side. Oral bulge opening roundish. Jerked to and
fro in an empty crustacean shell, when swimming rotated about main body axis. gelei (1954) found only
a single specimen in the summer plankton of a meadow puddle in the Börzsöny Mts., Upper Hungary. Too
insufficiently described to be recognized as a distinct species; body crests possibly caused by fixation. Best
considered as indeterminable. There is one unsubstantiated recorded from alkaline biotopes in Hortobágy
National Park, Hungary (szaBó 1999).
Dileptus striatus – Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 289 (Figs 145p, q). Based on Trichoda
striata mueller, 1786. Mentioned also by Dumas (1929, Les Microzoaires: 110) (Fig. 147r). Obviously,
Fromentel’s species is a Blepharisma, while that of Dumas (1929) is very likely a pleurostomatid ciliate.
Not cited in the revision of kahl (1930–1935).

Dileptus truncatus Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 291 (Fig. 145j). Not cited in the revision of
kahl (1930–1935). Not a dileptid, possibly a pleurostomatid haptorian or a Spirostomum. Best considered
as indeterminable.
Dileptus uvula – Fromentel, 1876, Études Microzoaires: 293 (Fig. 145o). Based on Trichoda uvula
mueller, 1773. Not cited in the revision of kahl (1930–1935) and in the catalogue of hypotrich names
(Berger 2001). Not a dileptid, but a hypotrich; possibly a junior synonym of Engelmanniella mobilis
(engelmann, 1862) Foissner, 1982.
Dileptus sp. (?) – conn, 1905, Bull. Conn. St. geol. nat. Hist. Surv. 2: 46 (Fig. 144a). Possibly a
Pseudomonilicaryon species. Length 350 μm in vivo. Narrowly dileptid with a length:width ratio of about
4.7:1. Proboscis about 40% of body length, indistinctly set off from bluntly fusiform trunk. Macronucleus
in middle quarters of trunk, composed of seven nodules in series. A dorsal row of contractile vacuoules in
trunk. conn (1905) found this species in brooks and rivers of Middletown, Connecticut, USA.
Dileptus sp. – Dragesco, 1963, Bull. biol. Fr. Belg. 97: 128 (Fig. 143x). An insufficiently described
Monomacrocaryon species. Length 120–180 μm in vivo. Very narrowly dileptid with a length:width
ratio of about 6.8:1. Proboscis about one half of body length, distinctly curved dorsally; trunk oblong
to bluntly fusiform and rounded posteriorly. Macronucleus in centre of trunk, oblong and curved. Two
dorsal contractile vacuoles: anterior vacuole at beginning of second fourth of trunk, posterior vacuole at
beginning of posterior fourth. Dragesco (1963) found this species in moss from Villefranche-sur-Mer,
France. It is most similar to Monomacrocaryon tenue, which is, however, smaller (60–110 μm vs. 120–180
μm) and has a shorter proboscis (1/3 vs. 1/2 of body length).
Dileptus sp. – thomPson & croom, 1978, Antarct. Res. Ser. 27: 44 (Fig. 144b). Body size of silver nitrate-
impregnated specimens 90.6–144.6 × 14.8–23.7 μm, on average 112.5 × 18.5 μm. Very narrowly dileptid
with a length:width ratio of about 6.8:1. Proboscis about one third of body length; trunk oblong to bluntly
fusiform and tapered posteriorly. Macronucleus in centre of trunk, twisted and nodulated. Many scattered
contractile vacuoles. thomPson & croom (1978) found this species in a small (~ 2 m2) tidal pool with
a maximum depth of 2 cm on King George Island, South Shetland Islands. Possibly, this is Rimaleptus
alpinus, which has been found in the Antarctis by Foissner (1996b).
Micruncus nov. gen. complanatus nov. sp. DelPhy, 1938, Bull. Stn biol. Arcachon 35: 62 (Fig. 143q). Size
250 × 50 μm in vivo, while only 120 μm long according to the figure provided; strongly flattened, that
is, less than 10 μm thick. Shape Epispathidium amphoriforme-like with a length:width ratio of about 5:1.
Two globular inclusions (macronucleus?) in mid of trunk. Cytoplasm yellowish. Cortex thick. Ciliature
holotrichous. DelPhy (1938) classified Micruncus in the family Tracheliidae; corliss (1979) and lynn
(2008) followed. Dragesco (1963) did not cite it in his monograph. Certainly not a dileptid, possibly
a poorly observed spathidiid or pleurostomatid haptorian, or a Remanella. Very likely, this species is
indeterminable.
Phragelliorhynchus nasutus herrick, 1884, Science 4: 73; without figure. schewiakoFF (1896) synonymized
Ph. nasutus with Amphileptus anser (now Pseudomonilicaryon anser). Indeed, Phragelliorhynchus nasutus
resembles Pseudomonilicaryon anser and P. fraterculum in having a very long and highly motile proboscis,
but is much smaller (200 μm vs. about 500 μm) and thus conspecificity can be excluded. kahl (1931)
considered Phragelliorhynchus nasutus as a junior synonym of Dileptus gigas (now Monomacrocaryon
gigas). We disagree because M. gigas is much larger (up to 1.6 mm vs. 200 μm) and has a much shorter
proboscis (1/5 vs. 1/2 of body length). This species, which herrick (1884) found in Minnesota, USA,
should be considered as indeterminable because of the weak description and the absence of a figure.

authors”.
Dileptus acutus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 115 (Fig. 147p). The species is referred as Dileptus acutatus

Dileptus arcuatus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 119 (Fig. 146t). Mentioned also by Dumas (1937,
Les Microzoaires: 40) (Fig. 148i). Certainly, D. arcuatus sensu Dumas (1929) and Dumas (1937) are not
conspecific because of the very different body shape (broadly vs. cylindroidally dileptid). Their identity
remains obscure. Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus biacuta Dumas, 1937, Les Microzoaires: 41 (Fig. 148c). Certainly not a dileptid. Best considered
as indeterminable.
Dileptus bicaudatus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 120 (Fig. 147n). The species is referred as Dileptus
caudatus in the figure legend (Pl. XXXI, fig. 2). Length in vivo 100 µm. Shape very narrowly dileptid
with proboscis occupying almost half of body length; posterior end with two unequally long tail-like
projections. Nuclear apparatus not observed because cytoplasm packed with globules. A single terminal
contractile (?) vacuole in shorter tail-like projection. Possibly, this is a wounded or malformed dileptid.
Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus bicornis Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 118 (Fig. 146e). Length in vivo 85 µm. Proboscis
occupies almost half of body length; trunk cylindroidal, with a triangular projection each right and left
of base of proboscis; posterior end tail-like. Nuclear apparatus not described, but Dumas (1929) figured
an ellipsoidal structure (macronucleus?) in centre of trunk. A single contractile (defecation?) vacuole at
base of tail. Cytoplasm finely granulated. Possibly, a wounded or malformed dileptid. Best considered as
indeterminable.
Dileptus bicristatus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 118 (Fig. 146f). Length in vivo 75 µm. Proboscis
occupies about half of body length; trunk bluntly fusiform, with a transverse triangular projection each
right and left of base of proboscis; posterior end narrowly rounded. Nuclear apparatus not described,
but Dumas (1929) figured an ellipsoidal structure (macronucleus?) in centre of trunk. A single terminal
contractile (defecation?) vacuole. Cytoplasm finely granulated. Possibly, a wounded or malformed dileptid.
Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus brachiatus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 119 (Figs 146i, j). Length in vivo 125 µm. Shape
narrowly dileptid with proboscis occupying about 40% of body length; trunk bluntly fusiform; posterior end
acute. Nuclear apparatus not described, but Dumas (1929) figured an ellipsoidal structure (macronucleus?)
in centre of trunk. A single contractile (?) vacuole in dorsal side of mid-body, where Dumas (1929) observed
a long, mobile, finger-like projection; possibly a Protospathidium attacking the Dileptus. Best considered
as indeterminable.

Dileptus cavicaudus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 110 (Fig. 147q). Length in vivo 90 µm. Body
fusiform with proboscis occupying about one third of body length. Nuclear apparatus not described, but
Dumas (1929) figured two ellipsoidal structures (macronuclear nodules?) in trunk. A single contractile
(defecation?) vacuole slightly above hook-like curved, hyaline posterior body portion. Possibly, a wounded
or malformed dileptid. Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus cilunculus Dumas, 1930, Les Microzoaires: 88 (Fig. 148a). Dumas (1930) considered this species
as a variety of D. hians Dumas, 1930. Certainly not a dileptid; possibly a wounded ciliate. Best considered
as indeterminable.
Dileptus cinereus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 116 (Fig. 147h). Length in vivo 90 µm. Body fusiform
with proboscis occupying about one third of body length. Macronucleus oblong, in centre of trunk. Two
dorsal contractile vacuoles. Cytoplasm greyish. Possibly a Monomacrocaryon species, resembling M.
tenue which is, however, contractile and has a cylindroidal and curved or twisted macronucleus.
Dileptus clavipes Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 117 (Figs 146b, c). Very likely, the figures show the
proboscis area of regenerating Dileptus specimens. Thus, the species is indeterminable.
Dileptus corniculatus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 121 (Fig. 147f). The species is referred as D.
corniculata in the figure legend (Pl. XXVII, fig. 12). Length in vivo 160 µm. Shape crescentic with
anterior and posterior third narrowing to acute ends. Oral opening small, at beginning of second body third.
Macronucleus (food inclusion?) globular, in centre of trunk. A terminal contractile (defecation?) vacuole.
Possibly, a poorly observed Microdileptus or Monomacrocaryon. Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus costatus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 117 (Fig. 146m). Length in vivo 155 µm. Proboscis
as long as broadly fusiform trunk; tail long and comparatively broadly rounded posteriorly, flattened and
hyaline. Two separate macronuclear nodules in centre of trunk. A single contractile vacuole at base of tail.
Five rows of shiny granules between ribs on trunk. Very likely a pleurostomatid ciliate.
Dileptus crispatus Dumas, 1930, Les Microzoaires: 85 (Fig. 148b). Certainly, the figure shows a strongly
wounded ciliate. Thus, the species is indeterminable.
Dileptus cristatus Dumas, 1937, Les Microzoaires: 40 (Fig. 148p). Length in vivo 85 µm. Shape narrowly
dileptid. Proboscis occupies about 35% of body length, with 7–8 dorsal papillae forming a serrate pattern;
trunk cylindroidal with narrowly rounded posterior end. Dumas (1937) did not describe nuclear and
contractile vacuole apparatus, but figured two globules (macronuclear nodules?) in centre of trunk and a
single subterminal contractile vacuole. Possibly a distinct dileptid.
Dileptus cuspidatus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 114 (Fig. 147v). Not a dileptid, but a wounded or
malformed ciliate. Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus cylindricus Fromentel, 1876 – Dumas (1929, Les Microzoaires: 120) (Fig. 146w). See “various
authors”.
Dileptus cylindroïdes Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 114 (Fig. 147l). This is a wounded ciliate or a
dileptid that supposedly lost the proboscis. Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus decorus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 111 (Fig. 147g). Length in vivo 60 µm. Nuclear
apparatus (food inclusions?) in form of a rosette with six lobes. A single subterminal contractile vacuole.
Possibly a pleurostomatid with a large food inclusion. Best considered as indeterminable.
Dileptus diaphanus Dumas, 1929, Les Microzoaires: 110 (Fig. 147j). Length in vivo 110 µm. Body
fusiform, leaf-like flattened, and transparent. Proboscis occupies about one third of body length. Nuclear

Systematic Index
The index contains all names of dileptid ciliates and their food organisms as well as names of other ciliates
and organisms mentioned in the monograph. The index is two-sided, that is, species appear both with the
generic name ahead (for example, Dileptus margaritifer) and with the species name first (margaritifer,
Dileptus). Valid names (in our judgment) of dileptid subspecies, species, and genera are in boldface italics.
Acceptable suprageneric names of dileptids are in boldface spaced type. Invalid names (junior
homonyms, synonyms, outdated combinations or misspellings) of dileptids are given in parentheses. All
non-dileptid names are in ordinary font, i.e., in italics and without parentheses. Boldface page number
indicates the location of the main description of a taxon.
