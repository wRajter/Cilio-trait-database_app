ABSTRACT: We characterized the ecological niches of several planktonic prostome ciliates with
respect to their food demand and temperature. We found intergeneric differences between Balanion
planctonicumand the 2 Urotrichaspp., U. furcataand U. farcta. There were also significant interspe-
cific differences within the genus Urotricha and intraspecific differences between 2 Balanion spp.
and 3 U. furcataisolates from distant lakes. Relative to Urotricha spp., Balanionappeared to be the
superior competitor at low to medium food concentrations and reached high growth rates at moder-
ate temperatures. The threshold prey concentration for positive population growth of B. plancton-
icumwas lower than that obtained for the 2 Urotricha spp., but higher than that reported earlier for
the marine species, B. comatum. A third Urotricha species, U. castalia, was investigated for its tem-
perature response only. The temperature response revealed species-specific temperature adaptation
between B. planctonicum and the sympatric U. furcata, and further differences within the genus
Urotricha: U. farcta grew fastest at high temperatures; U. castaliawas adapted to low temperatures;
and U. furcatapeaked at moderately warm temperatures.

The functional response was also different for the 3
ciliate species. Ingestion rates of Urotricha farcta
increased with algal concentrations up to ~1.2 ×

model yielded a maximum ingestion rate of 4.0 ±

k of ~1.4 × 105 prey cells ml–1. These predicted para-

meters may be overestimates, if an asymptote is not
adequately predicted by the model. The threshold
value was insignificant (p = 0.17). Concerning the
paucity of the data at high food concentrations, a firm
conclusion about the shape of the functional response
curve in U. farctacannot be made.
